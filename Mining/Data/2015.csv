Sometimes they even obtain optimal solutions. However, to achieve near-optimal solutions, the appropriate tuning of parameters is required. This paper presents a Racing based learning module proposal for an autonomous parameter tuning of Metaheuristics. After a literature review on Metaheuristics parameter tuning and Racing approaches, the learning module is presented. A computational study for the resolution of the Scheduling problem is also presented. Comparing the preliminary obtained results with previous published results allow to conclude about the effectiveness and efficiency of this proposal.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170351","Artificial Intelligence;Learning;Metaheuristcs;Parameter Tuning;Racing;Scheduling","Tuning;Processor scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Optimization;Bibliographies;Genetic algorithms","","","","26","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the progress of these techniques in recent years by psychologists and marketing professionals, there is still a clear absence of models that help to identify in real time the affinity, the interests and the preferences of consumers for a particular product or brand. In order to solve the above, three adaptive vector models are developed and analyzed, based on the principles of computational intelligence, to identify in real time the affinity of consumers for certain audiovisual advertising by recording their brain bioelectrical activity. The results obtained, reach levels of identification of affinity close to 80% on average, from the identification of its predisposition to short periods of time throughout the length of certain audiovisual advertising.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170363","Neuromarketing;Affinity;Computational Intelligence;Support Vector Mechines;Electroencefalographic Signals (EEG);Brain Computer Interface (BCI)","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Kernel;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Headphones","","","","36","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The development of this dynamic adaptation approach is inspired on evolutionary computation and hyper-heuristics. Our empirical results show that a selection constructive hyper-heuristic could be advantageous on solving dynamic adaptation optimization problems.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170370","Dynamic Scheduling;Rescheduling;Hyper-Heuristics;Optimization;Dynamic Adaptation","Dynamic scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Processor scheduling;Evolutionary computation","","","","24","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because that no single technique to estimate software development effort is best for all situations, it is important to propose new models to compare their results and then generate more realistic estimates. In this study, the aimed is to present a hybrid model that combine fuzzy logic and neural networks for achieving higher accuracy for estimating the development time of software projects. The accuracy of time estimation for a Neuro-Fuzzy System (NFS) is statistically better than the accuracy obtained from a previous NFS and statistical regression (model most used by default to compare) when the forty-one modules developed from ten programs were used as dataset. Results show that the value of MMRE (Mean of Magnitude of Relative Error) applying a NFS was substantially lower than MMRE applying a previous NFS and statistical regression. It can be conclude that a new NFS could be applied for estimating the effort of software development projects when they have been individually developed on a disciplined process.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170378","Artificial neural Networks;fuzzy logic;neuro-fuzzy system;Software effort estimation","Software;Estimation;Artificial neural networks;Fuzzy logic;Accuracy;Mathematical model;Input variables","","4","","41","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the benefits harvested from the delivery of professional services on a near-shore model can be replicated to other functions from a business transformation programme, such as competence and training management projects, improving cultural affinity at an overall effective cost, reducing complexity and risks associated with remoteness. Using a large business transformation programme from a global consumer goods company as a single case study, the present paper analyses the benefits and main challenges of incorporating such delivery model in these types of projects, focusing its attention mainly on the financial and quality aspects. The analysis suggests that, when compared to traditional services delivery (on-site consultants), near-shoring practices can have a very positive financial impact for the vendor and the customer, translating into an increase on the Return on Investment (ROI) without a significant increase of risks or losses in quality - The service's cost can have a significant reduction on the vendor side, with a consequent reduction to the end client. Regardless these benefits, it is suggested that traditional consulting still plays an un-replaceable role in these types of projects, especially by providing expert insights on the industry/solution and specifics of the local market and culture. Furthermore, it is suggested that it is equally important the commitment from top management for such initiatives, with the implementation of a clear and focused governance model to reduce eventual risks from remoteness or cultural clashes. Finally, the article also points out some directions for further research on the topic.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170387","Outsourcing;Off-Shoring;Near-shoring;Business Transformation;Training;Services;Consulting","Training;Companies;Focusing;Cultural differences;Industries;Communities","","1","","9","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computing optimal solutions in many of these problems are unmanageable. Heuristic search methods are known to obtain good results in an acceptable time interval. However, parameters need to be adjusted to allow good results. In this sense, learning strategies can enhance the performance of a system, providing it with the ability to learn, for instance, the most suitable optimization technique for solving a particular class of problems, or the most suitable parameterization of a given algorithm on a given scenario. Hyper-heuristics arise in this context as efficient methodologies for selecting or generating (meta) heuristics to solve NP-hard optimization problems. This paper presents the specification of a hyper-heuristic for selecting techniques inspired in nature, for solving the problem of scheduling in manufacturing systems, based on previous experience. The proposed hyper-heuristic module uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which enables the system with the ability to autonomously select the meta-heuristic to use in optimization process as well as the respective parameters. A computational study was carried out to evaluate the influence of the hyper-heuristics on the performance of a scheduling system. The obtained results allow to conclude about the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170394","Hyper-heuristics;Machine Learning;Q-Learning;Optimization;Scheduling;Meta-heuristics;Multi-Agent Systems","Job shop scheduling;Context;Learning (artificial intelligence);Processor scheduling;Optimal scheduling","","8","","30","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some organizations are beginning to have problems to manage and analyze these huge volumes of data. This is due, in large part, to the relational databases which are the primary method of data storage in a data warehouse, and start underperforming, crumbling under the weight of the data stored. In opposition to these systems, arise the NoSQL databases that are associated with the storage of very large volumes of data inherent to the Big Data paradigm. Thus, this article focuses on the study of the feasibility and the implications of the adoption of a NoSQL database, within the data warehousing context. MongoDB was selected to represent the NoSQL systems in this investigation. In this paper will be explained the processes required to design the structure of a data warehouse and typically dimensional queries in the MongoDB system. The undertaken research culminates in the performance analysis of queries executed in a traditional data warehouse, based on the SQL Server system, and an equivalent data warehouse based on the MongoDB system.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170400","NoSQL;Data warehouses;SQL Server;MongoDB","Servers;Data warehouses;Big data;Visualization;Databases;Bismuth;Marine vehicles","","4","","13","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a Serious Game whose main goal is to promote empathy as a mean to prevent bullying; the rationale for the prevention is that by helping victims and observers of these episodes of violence to practice an attitude/behavior change toward bullying one will be training and increasing those attitudes and behavioral competences for the real bullying situations. The relevance of our proposal is based on the high prevalence of bullying and the lack of demonstrated effectiveness of the current prevention interventions. The game runs on different platforms (smartphone, tablet, PC), provides flexibility in the choice of scenarios and in the game playing role. Player's decisions have obvious effects in the subsequent levels of the game. The treatment or intervention resorting to this game may take place at the therapist's office or outside, in an independent way.

Consequently, several ETL (Extract-Transform-and-Load) frameworks have been developed to make data integrations tasks suitable for later exploration studies, providing better solutions for data heterogeneity, diversity and distribution. However, current advanced data integration tasks depend on large and heterogeneous data sources that must be modelled according to the source specifications and network conditions. Furthermore, these automated tasks are significantly dependent of sequential processes that dramatically increase the global request and processing time. Without estimation of the task completion time, the whole research workflow becomes even more challenging.

Analyzing data from 38 business partners we conclude: i) the characteristics of the sites and partners tend to be homogeneous; ii) the overall effectiveness of the campaigns tends to be positive, mainly due to the non-financial effectiveness; and iii) the profile of the collective online shopping site has no influence on effectiveness, but the business partners profile and the characteristics of the campaigns are related to the effectiveness. This study may help business partners to evaluate the impact on their business from promotion campaigns using collective online shopping sites and make a decision whether to join or not.

This paper focuses on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) as although all organizations have their own requirements as far as information security is concerned, SMEs offer one of the most interesting cases for studying the issue of information security policies in particular, and information security in general. Within the organizational universe, SMEs assume a unique relevance due to their high number, which makes information security efficiency a crucial issue. There are several measures which can be implemented in order to ensure the effective protection of information assets, among which the adoption of ISS policies stands out. A recent survey concluded that among 307 SMEs, only 15 indicated to have an ISS policy. The conclusion drawn from that study was that the adoption of ISS policies has not become a reality yet. As an attempt to mitigate this fact, an academic-practitioner collaboration effort was established regarding the implementation of ISS policies in three SMEs. These interventions were conceived as Action Research (AR) projects. This article aims to constitute an empirical study on the applicability of the Action Research method in information systems, more specifically by assessing the adoption of an ISS policy in six SMEs, and identifying the critical success factors in adopting an ISS policy. The research question we intend to answer is to what extent this research method is adequate to reach the proposed goal. The results of the study suggest that AR is a promising means for the evaluation of ISS policies adoption. It can both act as a research method that improves the understanding about the reasons why the policy has been abandoned, for example by the users, and as a change method, assisting practitioners to overcome barriers and suggesting measures to be implemented in order to allow the ISS policy to be properly followed by all the company users on a daily basis.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170418","Action Research;Information Systems Security;Small and Medium Sized Enterprises","Companies;Planning;Reflection;Information security","","2","","23","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trying to avoid the limitations of template-based and classical NLG methods, systems based on automatic translation have been proposed in recent years. Despite providing sentences with the important variability needed for a better interaction, this doesn't come without a cost. Contrary to template-based, these systems produce sentences with heterogeneous quality. In this paper we proposed to combine a translation based NLG system with a classifier module capable of providing information on the Intelligibility or Quality of the sentences. Sentences marked as unacceptable are replaced by template-based generated ones. This classifier module is the main focus of the paper and combines extraction of linguistic features with a classifier trained in a manually annotated corpus. Results suggest that our approach is valid as best results obtained have false positives below 8% and this metric can be even lower in practical applications, decreasing to around 3%, as the generation module produces low quality sentences at a rate lower than 30%.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170419","Data2Text;Natural Language Generation (NLG);Portuguese;translation based NLG;sentences quality evaluation","Measurement;Feature extraction;Natural languages;Vegetation;Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Pragmatics","","2","","20","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A study of an access scheme using exhaustive polling technique for wireless body sensor network - WBAN is carried out in this paper. It is an alternative method for saving energy of sensor nodes. The influence of the buffer sizes of sensor nodes in relation to the transfer time and packet loss is investigated. These parameters are metrics in general used in computer networks to measure the QoS. Several scenarios were simulated taking into account the sizes of buffer of sensor nodes that directly influence the transfer time and packet loss, which are essentials for WBAN requiring real time processing. The study is carried out using a simulator developed in Matlab that generates and analyzes data based on exhaustive polling technique.

However, the usage of PACS to support radiology workflows, previously local to institutions, in remote environments still raises great technological and technical challenges to PACS administrators. The following article describes the most common workflows associated with the radiology service and proposes a computer method for their optimization. The proposed method provides an automatic framework for scheduling and performing repetitive tasks without human interaction. Moreover, it was designed to optimize the workflows associated with distributed PACS scenarios by enabling prefetching rules to be applied to medical image studies.

Development of online machine translation systems is also important for less-resourced languages, as they enable basic information transfer and communication. Although the quality of free online automatic translation systems is not perfect, it is important to assure acceptable quality. As human evaluation is time-consuming, expensive and subjective, automatic quality evaluation metrics try to approach and approximate human evaluation as much as possible. In this paper, several automatic quality metrics will be utilised, in order to assess the quality of specific machine translated text. Namely, the research is performed on sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain, resulting from the digitisation process of a scientific publication written in Croatian and English. The quality evaluation results are discussed and further analysis is proposed.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170425","automatic quality evaluation;machine translation;BLEU;NIST;METEOR;GTM;English-Croatian;Croatian-English;sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain","Measurement;Optical character recognition software;NIST;Terminology;Google;Context","","4","","24","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among other are registered the vehicle position, speed, and altitude. This data allows inferring relevant information such as the difficulty of the road and the recommended speed for a variety of scenarios. For instance, during fire-fighting, fire and civil protection can verify if these paths are useful and appropriate for their vehicle, thus improving response time. This article discusses the design of an open source web mapping application that features track sharing and uses those tracks to generate value for other activities. The article explains how the application selects and sorts paths composed by TTT tracks and normal roads, using diverse features to assist the decision making process of institutions such as Fire Department corporations.

Considering reduction in the algorithm convergence time, evolutionary computing strategies focus on the optimization of processes. An approach of evolutionary computing is the differential evolution. In order to improve performance in MIMO telecommunication systems, this work proposes a differential evolution-based algorithm for calculating beamformers.

To achieve the objective, an online survey was developed and 110 complete answers were considered. Beyond profiles definition, this paper defines groups of CAATs. This research contributes to enlighten a possible gap between auditors' needs, available training programmes and software houses' releases: despite tools' potential, auditors keep using spreadsheet to execute most of the work.

Decisions and actions are taken to repair and normalize the services caused by incidents. The process of efficient decision-making requires timing and standardization among all members of a team. Many organizations adopt Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) to structure and facilitate their decision-making. In turn, an important model of artificial intelligence, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), has aided the decision-making process using reasoning by analogy. This paper presents a decision support methodology described by a general decision-making process, aided by the CBR model, since ITIL does not propose resolution of incidents using analogy and IT environments rarely found standardization for reasoning by analogy. Thus, the aim is to facilitate decision-making and create standardization in the resolution of incidents considering reasoning by analogy. A prototype built with the framework JColibri served to validate the proposal of this work.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170448","Case-based reasoning;Decision making;Decision support methodology;ITIL","Integrated circuits;Cognition;Information technology;Libraries;Decision making;Unified modeling language;Software","","1","","12","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Personalization is a key issue in an era when there is so much information and so many people interacting in so many ways. Modern users desire a customized experience that adapts itself to their requirements and understands what they need even before they notice it. In order to morph any system into an adapting one, every relevant interaction with its users has to be maintained. Then, a mathematical structure capable of discovering patterns amongst that information is necessary, being able to classify users according to the roles they play. With a correct user categorization, the system knows when, how and what to do to adapt its content, via a mixed-initiative approach. In this paper, an artificial neural network is selected as classifier and users are divided in three roles, from beginners to experts. ADSyS, the target system of this proposal, adapts its content based on who is operating it, providing a higher usability. This guide on how to adapt a system to its users is built as part of ADSyS, but is intended to be generalized as a foundation to other systems.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170449","Artificial Neural Networks;User Modelling;Scheduling Systems;Human-Computer Interaction;Learning","Artificial neural networks;Adaptation models;Usability;Training;Proposals;Neurons;Computer architecture","","3","","23","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This “immaterial” dimension is related with the need that smart cities have to assess their citizen's feelings, perception and well-being, giving rise to an emotion-aware city. Mapping emotion builds on a tradition of studies in cognitive mapping, evaluative mapping, environmental preference and environmental affect, adding an approach in which people experience, evaluate and describe their environment “in situ” through social media. This paper aims to present an Ambient Geographic Information (AGI) approach to assemble geo-tagged data from Twitter, Flickr, Instagram and Facebook related with people's perception and feelings regarding Lisbon (Portugal), and therefore characterize its emotional dimension, by comparing these subjective observations with objective measurements (such as socio-demographic statistics, questionnaires and data retrieved from biometric sensors). With this vision of a smart city, that is capable to interpret and harnessing the emotional states of its citizens, it is essential to find new methods and techniques to sensing affect in an urban context.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170469","Ambient geographic information (AGI);Volunteered geographic information (VGI);emotional mapping;Social media;emotion-aware city;smart city;Big Data","Cities and towns;Smart cities;Media;Sensors;Social network services;Context;Geospatial analysis","","8","","25","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The organizational changes occurred had a positive impact on the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of access to health care, although not all objectives were fully achieved. The new organizational model, which aims to ensure the viability financial sustainability of CSP, will have to find the balance in the management of available resources while ensuring health for all. Information systems also allowed streamline processes. The search for greater operational efficiency, you can go through combating waste, in order to reduce the need for more financial resources for the same volume of activity developed.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170482","Primary health care;reform;Reorganization;Sustainability;Management","Medical services;Face;Surges;Silicon;Portals;Organizations","","","","16","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the digital world, there is no readymade way to distinguish a real handwritten signature on a scanned document from a forged copy of another signature made by the same person on another document that is simply “pasted” into the forged document. In this paper we describe how we are using the touch screen of smartphones or tablets to collect handwritten signature images and associated biometric markers derived from the motion direction of handwritten signatures that are made directly into the device touchscreen. These time base biometric markers can then be converted into signaling time waves, by using the dragging or lifting movements the user makes with a touch screen omnidirectional tip stylus, when he handwrites is signature at the device touchscreen. These time/space signaling time waves can then be converted into a biometric bit stream that can be matched with previously enrolled biometric markers of the user's handwritten signature. In this paper we contend that the collection of these simple biometric features is sufficient to achieve a level of user recognition and authentication that is sufficient for the majority of online user authentication and digital documents authenticity.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170483","signature;handwriting;biometric;verification;authentication","Handwriting recognition;Feature extraction;Authentication;Smart phones;Digital signatures","","","","10","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For qualifying customers, these entities are based on qualitative and quantitative information of a client, making it difficult a homogeneous rating. Because of the need to reduce response times regarding the approval or rejection of a credit application is important to use models that help to analyze a real-time credit. Hence, this paper develops and analyzes based on the principles of evolutionary computation model, and the principles of a fuzzy Takagi Sugeno type model, to estimate the score in the allocation of consumer loans. To optimize learning, the proposed model is subjected to a process of evolution, based on the EVOP model, which guides learning model, based on two parameters such as: the generation parameter and the parameter mutation thus generating a structured evolution that will take the model to different states in learning. The results obtained by the proposed model allows to decrease the time of granting of consumer credit, as allowed demonstrate the sensitivity of the model against the score, according to the variation of the amount requested by a customer.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170485","Kohonen Map;Neural Clustering;Score;Takagi Sugeno;Pay Capacity;Evolutionary Estrategies;EVOP","Computational modeling;Analytical models;Media;Data models;Time factors;Real-time systems;Evolutionary computation","","1","","18","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These services have advantages in financial transactions, but security threats and vulnerabilities must be constantly reduced. In this framework raises the “good citizen” that desires to do well and needs to avoid harmful behavior [1]. While the “bad citizen” promotes the lack of transparency, wrong attitudes and “hidden” awareness of the nature, level and scope of the financial impact which claims to reduce the social responsibility [2] and produces high level of degree of materialistic values were less likely to acquire moral [3]. Indeed, the integration of fraud on all aspects of the e-banking services requires the profound revision of the traditional commercial paradigms that have been prevailed for last years. Thus, on the one hand, the theoretical framework of this paper is based on literature about ethics and fraud, in general, and information and communication technology of the e-banking services, in particular. On the other hand, the empirical framework reflects the practices in this field of research used by banks with public data available on the Portuguese Banking Association. The results of the paper show several threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, impacts and response that face e-banking services. To mitigate these risks, the main challenge is the public discussion that will promote prevention and disclosure evidence-based incidents, not only to endorse an adequate behavior but, also, to develop guidance on practical evidence on ethics and reduce fraud.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170491","Ethics;Fraud;e-Banking Services;Portugal","Online banking;Ethics;Security;Electronic mail;Internet;Business","","2","","41","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to meet the previously identified needs, various types of systems have emerged, whose features incorporate data processing functions and obtaining information for supporting decision-making processes. Examples of such systems are the DSS and the use of BI architectures. Given that currently many of the organizations services are supported by the existent IT infrastructure, it is necessary that these are suitable for the supporting the proper functioning of the available services.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a rehabilitation program associated with the intervention with games improves recovery of stroke patients. The research consisted of a case study, in which two patients underwent a standard physical therapy program (control group) and two, physical therapy and training with games (intervention group). Both groups performed 32 sessions, lasting one hour each session. Patients were assessed by Fugl Meyer scale of the arm, Box and Block Test and Functional Independence Measure. Regarding the scale Fugl Meyer, the games group achieved superior results, as the motor function in the control group, but there were no significant differences between them.

Hospitals adopt a patient-centred care approach and invest massively in information systems and technology (IS/IT), in the hope that these investments will improve medical care and patient demands. From the point of view of public service, the focus of healthcare system is the patient, therefore any interventions should be based on their needs and expectations. It becomes more and more important that IS/IT investments support, not only short-term objectives, but also long-term benefits, in order to provide a proper service for organisations, professionals and end-users. The main objective of our research is to study how organisational maturity, enhanced by investments in IS/IT, project management and best practices, leads to successful projects in health system organisations. The Healthcare Data Platform is designed to be a health data sharing system, which facilitates the distribution of clinical information to the different agents that provide healthcare in the country. The rational of our model is that organisational maturity has a positive effect on project success, and that this success is also positively enhanced by the use of project management practices. We emphasise that this combination of approaches can increase the effectiveness of projects. Furthermore, it can also improve confidence that the results of investments will meet stakeholders' expectations, by realising benefits and by adding a perceived value to organisations.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170516","Maturity Models;Project Success;Project Management;IS/IT investments","Project management;Medical services;Investment;Stakeholders;Mediation;Internet","","1","","92","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems' features aim to improve patient treatments by collecting comprehensive electronic patient records. Understanding these data is a vital step towards personalized medicine. Yet, the growing number of disease-specific patient registries brings new challenges for life sciences developers. These systems are closed data silos, with independent formats and data models. As they were built with security and privacy in mind, available tools lack comprehensive data access mechanisms, thus making data sharing a complex process. However, exchanging knowledge is essential to a better understanding of studied diseases. To tackle these challenges we introduce a semantic web-based architecture to connect distributed and heterogeneous registries. This enables the federation of knowledge between multiple independent environments. The semantic web paradigm enhances the ways we deal with data, optimising how we can create, infer and publish knowledge. Hence, we adopt these modern standards to deploy patient registry add ons. These can extract anonymised data and elevate them to a knowledge-oriented format, common to all registries. The outcome is a unique semantic layer, connecting miscellaneous registries, which we access using federated querying. Ultimately, this strategy empowers an holistic view through connected registries, enabling state-of-the-art semantic data sharing and access.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170546","Distributed/Internet based software;engineering tools and techniques;interoperability;data translation;semantic web;bioinformatics","Diseases;Semantic Web;Semantics;Ontologies;Databases;Bioinformatics","","","","26","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Animation can help students on the analysis and understanding of given programs, and can also guide on the development of new ones. It is very important to give students the opportunity to practice solving programming exercises by themselves. Receiving feedback is essential for knowledge acquisition. New tools arose (especially in the area of programming contests) to allow for the submission of solutions (programs developed by the students) to the problem statements presented by the teacher and to assess them, returning immediately information about the submitted answer. These tools can be incorporated into teaching activities, allowing students to test their work getting immediate feedback. Automatic evaluation systems significantly improve students performance. In this article are shown these two approaches, animation and automatic assessment, and proposed a new pedagogical practice resulting from the combination of both.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170548","programming;learning;students;animation;automatic evaluation","Visualization;Animation;Programming profession;Education;Java;Software algorithms","","2","","23","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, an organizational culture should be noted that values knowledge not only as an essential device to researchers, but as a fundamental resource to research environments able to boost the production of scientific knowledge.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170556","knowledge management;knowledge sharing","Knowledge management;Production;Instruments;Companies;Tornadoes;Computational modeling","","","","15","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The generation of these networks according to the requirements, if done manually by road design specialists, results in a time consuming task. Procedural generation of road networks comes as a solution to this problem with the creation of complete road networks definition adequate to simulation. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate an optimized definition of very large roads network, in an integrated process, from the selection of nodes in a terrain area, to the network topological definition. The human supervisor can interact with this generation process at any stage, in order to obtain custom road networks definitions. The proposed method reduces the use of specialists for preparing large road networks definitions. These definitions are suitable to integrate into a broader process to create road environments, with different road types, appropriate to conducting scientific experiments in driving simulation.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170557","Procedural Generation;Road Network;Road Network Design;Driving Simulation","Roads;Cities and towns;Solid modeling;Sociology;Statistics;Vehicles","","6","","21","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A phenomenological analysis is used in this work for the value creation both from designers and customers. This approach broadens the scope of value creation and measure beyond designer proposition emphasizing on value co-creation in a social context, where service as a skill and knowledge transmission, transform those last aspects in fundamental operant resources for value creation in use.

The hyperconnectivity that digital tools provide has done nothing but reinforce these trends and crowdfunding is one of the tools that has become prominent. This system of collective funding is constantly growing and its strength lies in that its usefulness comes from millions of people around the world, organized in virtual communities through social networks and platforms specialized in this formula that are themselves a social network. Social causes, business projects and cultural products have understood this new reality in which a prominent role is conferred, on the one hand to the entrepreneur who advocates masification and participation, and secondly, to an ever more active, autonomous, participative, committed and demanding user.

Ensemble learning approach combined with data resampling gains popularity to solve class imbalance problem, recently. RUSBoost and SMOTEBoost are two such methods that combine data resampling techniques with boosting procedure. We propose RUSMultiBoost, a hybrid method that is constituent of MultiBoost ensemble and random undersampling (RUS) to solve the class imbalance problem. Our new method is as simple as RUSBoost but more efficient and effective. We test our method on twelve data sets for class imbalance problem and compare the performance with simple and advanced hybrid ensemble methods. Experimental results show that our hybrid ensemble method performs significantly better than other methods on benchmark data sets using G-mean, Sensitivity and F1-measure.

The development of intelligent robots leads to the ability of them becoming an operator highly efficient and able to adapt to a wide range of problems. Still, despite of the several robotic solutions available, the majority of current industrial robots do not use the Robotic Operative System (ROS) and have limitations in terms of autonomously correct errors during their tasks. An important aspect to consider when developing a new robot is the selection of the methodology for recognition of the objects to be handled. In this paper, it will be presented an approach with enough flexibility to be potentially applicable to different scenarios of object recognition and handling normally found in industrial environment. The main aim is for this application to be applied to pick and place routines in robotics. Moreover it will be presented one particular case study that used the proposed approach, the European Robotics Challenges (EUROC) - a challenge aiming to develop a robot for shop floor logistics and manipulation. Our proposed approach is based on the three tiers paradigm: 1-recognition/sensing tier, 2-effector tier and 3-the control tier and was built using the ROS framework. Since ROS is becoming one of the most useful tools in robotics nowadays, the possibility of using a methodology able to be expressed in ROS allows for the development of a standard approach to pick and place operations. Another advantage of our proposed pick and place approach is the ability to have a robot safely and efficiently inserted in an unknown environment. This is possible due to the insertion of an adaptive control tier in our methodology. The proposed approach can be valuable in the field of robotics and can be potentially applied in multiple tasks and it has already allowed us to advance to the next stage of the already mention challenge.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170602","Robotic Operative System (ROS);Robotic Manipulator Arm;Intelligent Robot;Dictionary of Objects;Path Planning;Feedback Control;Image Processing","Service robots;Robot sensing systems;Grippers;Robot kinematics;Cameras;Object recognition","","12","","16","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These spaces have been brought to light, however, for reasons quite beyond their traditional usage, not only regarding the diversity of typical clients benefiting from the activities carried out, but also when the objectives of such activities are considered. The common exploration of the ludic potential of multisensory stimulation environments by occupational therapists presented us with the problem of how to design a computer game to combine with such context, in particular when delivering therapy to children with intellectual disability. In this paper we explore how the computer-mediated ludic activity can add value to an intervention focused on playfulness, having as background context the multisensory environment. We elaborate particularly around the translation of a set of design guidelines into a simulation of the Portuguese traditional game “jogo da malha”, expanded by fantasy elements, as an orientation for a near-future project.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170605","Multisensory stimulation environments;Computer game design;Design Guidelines","Games;Context;Computers;Design methodology;Computational modeling;Pediatrics","","5","","30","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The computer controlled firefighters will go for rescue in an indoor fire scenario, while the player is able to either help them by playing a fellow firefighter or just watch the NPCs solve the situation. These NPCs are made using a Unity3D plug-in named RAIN to speed up the development process, which helps modelling the perceptions of the agents and their behaviours. These processes will be described and the result is a rescue simulation tool showing advantages in debugging behavioural models, which leverages the creation of these types of simulations. The less the player realizes that a firefighter is in fact an NPC being treated as another human player, the more likely the player is expected to behave socially.

We take as a starting point that mass media constitute a privileged access platform, because through language they spread a particular world vision, even though the press - as publicly representation - intend to accommodate a wide and heterogeneous set of speeches. The mass media, as active agents in social processes, target imagined, massive, and diverse audiences, because through its discourse, they present fragments and perspectives of the “reality” with which hide, describe, make visible, ignore or reinforce constructions and ideologies.

The predicted rise in the demand for STEM professionals in the work market in the next ten years is greater than that predicted for other sectors. Numerous initiatives exist that focus on educational innovations in order to enhance the skills and knowledge of the pupils in the STEM disciplines during their educational life. One of these innovations is the utilization of personalised learning itineraries guided by game-based learning. Intrinsically, the games stimulate motivation and competitiveness between the students. They are socially inclusive and they can be easily adapted to different progress and knowledge levels. Creating games helps in the design of personalized itineraries that allow for the detection of characteristics, skills and/or the drawbacks of each student, making it possible to analyse student progress. Even though, currently, games dedicated to STEM teaching exist, their quality is not sufficient to cover the needs of young students and few of them allow for the creation of itineraries. Moreover, the educator is not able to adapt the existing games to the curricular content without having programming knowledge. This paper focuses on the research of the technological challenge to define and to build a platform to allow for the creation of learning itineraries based on games and oriented to the educational pre-university stages. This platform will be able to create and adapt these itineraries as well as being able to build specific games for the students, making the analysis of their competences and their curricular evaluations easier. The novelty of this proposal lies in the possibility of interactively creating learning itineraries based on games. This platform will help teachers to detect the characteristics, skills and/or drawbacks of each pupil as well as enabling them to build personalized games even if they don't have programming skills. In addition, this platform will provide the tools to increase the student's motivation. Finally, it will integrate the family into the educational process, making the child's needs in the home-study sessions more understandable.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170612","serious games;learning itineraries;education;game-based learning","Games;Education;Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Programming profession","","2","","22","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recent developments in the video game industry have heightened the need to involve players in the design process, the research to date has tended to focus on participatory design with children rather than older adults. Moreover, due to the lack of information regarding gamers' social context and their experiences, there has been little agreement on whether video games with a multiplayer dimension are suitable for this age group. Through online and face-to-face group workshops with five experienced and five novice gamers aged 50 and over, we discuss the potential of social network games for older adults and the main game design components, which can encourage them to play. The results of this study suggest that a player versus environment (PvE) mode is preferred to player versus player (PvP) games and that collaboration between players should be prioritized over competition.

This faces us with a second digital divide around the use of ICTs. This paper presents four initiatives developed at the LINTI (Laboratory of Research in New Information Technologies) of the Computer Science School of the National University of La Plata, in the research line “Education, Videogames and Free Software” whose goal is to take innovative proposals to the classroom promoting a critical appropriation of ICTs and a significative, active learning.

To accomplish previous objectives, an online survey was developed and applied to Portuguese Statutory Auditors. The motivations to use Computer-assisted Audit Tools (CAATs) will be discussed, either the constructs suggested by Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence and Facilitating Conditions) or new motivations' dimensions suggested from quantitative data analysis and open questions analyses.

This strategy is not free of risks. The growing proximity between the journalists and audience and the permanente exhibition that follows this approach, leads to ethical risks and new deontological challenges for the journalists. In order to examine how the Portuguese journalists use online social networks and identify the key ethical and moral risks of their actions online, we conducted, in 2014, a pioneer national survey of 300 professionals in 76 national news organizations. The conducted research shows that the use of online social networks is an established practice among Portuguese journalists that combine, in these platforms, a personal and a professional use - either expressing opinions or sharing others opinions on public interest matters - with prejudice to professional ethics.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4345-5","10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7170626","online social networks;journalism;Web 2.0;ethics;professional deontology;online conduct","Twitter;Media;Ethics;Face;Facebook;Internet","","","","22","","30 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the last two decades, the assessment of the patient's health status has undergone a dramatic change of paradigm, evolving from a predominant reliance on biochemical and physical measurements to an emphasis on health outcomes based on personal appreciation of the patient's illness. There are several measuring instruments to evaluate Quality of Life (QoL) in general and HRQoL in particular but the real-time analysis of data produced by these instruments is only possible with technology associated with decision support systems (DSS). The development of these types of information systems are a few problems that must be resolved.

The reasons have been the constant increase of users visits (which in some cases exceeds 50% of unique visitors), and the strong belief that social networks have come to stay. These virtual streets forming the cyberspace have emerged as the main scenario in the functioning of the current ecosystem of communication, and also in a good part of the strategies of economic, social, and political actors.
