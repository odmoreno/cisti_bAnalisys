"Capture and maintenance of projects total cost minimization applications' results","R. Moutinho; A.

Lately, it was developed an application that serves as a central platform that integrates all those previous implementations. Currently, such platform allows the access and execution of each one of the other utilities as modules/plugins. Each of which can be configured to execute optimizations over different projects. Although the platform already saves the optimization results, it lacks a suitable processing mechanism that would ease the cross analysis over all the utilities. Therefore, we want to include capture and analysis of results into the platform in order to properly aggregate them in a results database. Such database could then be queried for numerous purposes being the performance evaluation, across the optimization utilities, one of the first. In this project we analyze a total of five heterogeneous optimization utilities, all coded in Java, using algorithms based on dynamic programming and global optimization. The heterogeneity poses a challenge which we overcame by establishing a common results storage language, by means of XML files.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556720","Project Scheduling;Optimization Applications;XML Processing","Optimization;XML;Databases;Java;Context;Data mining;Resource management","","","","11","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital identity management is the collection of processes, policies and technologies to manage the complete life cycle of users' identities, such as creation, management, and destruction. Most web applications request users to have a registered digital identity in their system to allow access to their services. Having a myriad of digital identities to manage, users tend to take less protective measures regarding their identities and become reluctant at the moment of adopting (other) applications. Furthermore, having the personal information scattered across many systems, concerns users about its whereabouts and many times leads them to provide false information. The Federation identity concept was introduced to address user digital identity management overload by creating a framework for systems interoperability. It establishes a set of rules and standards in order to create a reliable and secure namespace for the exchanging of identity information between source (usually users via their identity provider) and target (usually web applications), allowing users to access several web applications seamlessly by using only one digital identity. This paper reflects on an approach to the federated identity management, by using a collection of federation standards for the developing of a federated identity provider to enable users to access the web applications seamlessly using a publicly available strong identification mechanism: the National Electronic Citizen Identity Card. Our aim with the development of the GlobaliD identity provider is to take a step further in the digital identity management, making it more versatile, responsible, anonymity and privacy-safe, trustworthy and thus secure.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556694","GlobaliD;GiD;Citizen Card;Fingerprint;Digital Identity Management;Digital Identity;Identity;Authentication","IP networks;Authentication;Privacy;Electronic mail;Standards;Context;Protocols","","","","22","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way to discover defects and increase the quality of GUIs is through testing. Test cases can be created manually or produced automatically from a model of the GUI. The size and complexity of GUIs makes it unpractical to do extensive manual testing. However, creating a model of the GUI in order to generate automatically test cases is also a laborious task. This paper presents a reverse engineering approach for diminishing the effort required for constructing the model of an existing GUI. The GUI is exercised by a combination of manual and automatic exploration, and information about its structure and some of its behaviour is automatically extracted, resulting in an incomplete GUI model. This model is subsequently completed manually, validated and used as input for automatic test generation and execution.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556690","Reverse engineering;GUI modelling;GUI testing","Graphical user interfaces;Testing;Reverse engineering;Data mining;XML;Manuals;Navigation","","8","1","18","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work is also part of a larger project, related to the coordination of intelligent agents in the execution of joint missions. The connection between the two systems is the management of the aircrafts that perform the missions.

This paper describes learning resources with formal semantics procesable by machines and it offers a solution according to the challenge of sharing information independently generated in distributed way by dynamic sources. The developed ontology optimizes learning processes because it helps students, professors, designers of learning material, and automatic processes of software in their searching, acquiring, and using of learning material.

The first comprises the decoupling, as much as possible, of the optimization process from the application specific processing tasks. In order to attain this goal, we opted to make use of intelligent techniques (i.e. metaheuristics). The second goal is to allow remote operation, and consequently great portability and interoperability, between the optimization tools and the visualization application.

This paper focuses on the key issues and challenges faced in the design and implementation of a distributed remote patient monitoring system using the Internet as communication platform, while describing some of the technologies that can be employed for this purpose. To optimize the systems' usability by medical care professionals, intuitive interfaces were developed using Web technologies, with an Internet browser as the only tool required to access the system. The study demonstrated that data updating based on database pooling system (periodic queries) is not the optimal solution, as the resulting system is not scalable.

In order to assist the development of a web prototype tool (broker tool), intelligent and flexible, that integrates all the selection model activities and tools, and with the capacity to adequate to each D/A/V E project or instance (this is the major goal of our final project), we intend in this paper to show: a formulation of a kind of resources selection problem and the limitations of the algorithms proposed to solve it. We formulate a particular case of the problem as an integer programming, which is solved using simplex and branch and bound algorithms, and identify their performance limitations (in terms of processing time) based on simulation results. These limitations depend on the number of processing tasks and on the number of pre-selected resources per processing tasks, defining the domain of applicability of the algorithms for the problem studied. The limitations detected open the necessity of the application of other kind of algorithms (approximate solution algorithms) outside the domain of applicability founded for the algorithms simulated.

However, the management of cryptographic keys of these systems is a tough task. They are usually protected by the use of password-based authentication mechanisms, which is a weak link on conventional cryptographic systems, as the passwords can be easily copied or stolen. The usage of a biometric approach for releasing the keys is an alternative to the password-based mechanisms. But just like passwords, we need mechanisms to keep the biometrical signal safe. One approach for such mechanism is to use biometrical key cryptography. The cryptographic systems based on the use of biometric characteristics as keys are called biometrical cryptographic systems. This article presents the implementation of Fuzzy Vault, a biometrical cryptographic system written in Java, along with its performance evaluation. Fuzzy Vault was tested on a real application using smartcards.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556637","Biometric authentication;smartcards;fuzzy vault;biometrical cryptographic systems","Cryptography;Authentication;Random access memory;Java;EPROM;Biological system modeling","","1","","11","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within these conditions programmers need development tools and techniques with an extreme level of productivity. We consider the code reuse as the most prominent approach to solve that problem. Our proposal uses the advantages provided by the Aspect-Oriented Programming in order to build a reusable framework capable to turn both programmer and application oblivious as far as data persistence is concerned, thus avoiding the need to write any line of code about that concern. Besides the benefits to productivity, the software quality increases. This paper describes the actual state of the art, identifying the main challenge to build a complete and reusable framework for Orthogonal Persistence in concurrent environments with support for transactions. The present work also includes a successfully developed prototype of that framework, capable of freeing the programmer of implementing any read or write data operations. This prototype is supported by an object oriented database and, in the future, will also use a relational database and have support for transactions.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556633","aspect;oriented;programming;orthogonal;persistence","Prototypes;Programming;Transient analysis;Databases;Object recognition;Java;Semantics","","1","","24","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of using traditional robot odometry estimation methods, we have tested an independent indoor localization system for real-time localization. We conducted an experiment in two steps: first, creating and testing interaction interfaces with and between robotic systems, and secondly, wrapping all in a multi-agent system, defining a vacuuming-cleaning ontology. With the pose data from an indoor localization system, is it possible to compare with real robot positions. From this, we can make some platform assumptions regarding heterogeneous robot cooperation, by thinking further i.e. sharing workspace with humans.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556631","IntelliCare;Assistive Multi-Agent Systems;Eldercare;Activity Coordination;Robot Localization","Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Ontologies;Cleaning;Collision avoidance","","","","34","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Practices such as blended and e-Learning have been introduced as well as continuous initiatives and programmes. Given these changes higher learning institutions must try to adapt to their students' digital culture, which is conducive to new needs. This factor may indicate that new strategies and methodologies must be addressed and implemented in the classroom context, which must be adjusted to a new learning. The use of casting technologies has been found to be increasingly used associated with their apparent potential impact. Changes and innovations regarding the content of various subjects as well as respective activities are on the horizon. This need for change stems from the new technological environments/contexts within which the students are included. This work arises within the scope of the proposed creation of a research plan in Doctoral Programme in Multimedia in Education. The aim of this project is to assess the integration of podcasts, vodcasts, screencasts and emerging casting technologies in higher education learning environments and to assess both students' and teachers' opinions, practices and expectations. In this study we propose to create and integrate multimedia teaching contents, not only to support activities carried out in new learning environments whether face-to-face or distance learning, but also as a methodological strategy to adopt.

The distributed control modules are developed based on embedded systems. Embedded systems are becoming increasingly common due to the fast deployment of advanced microcontrollers offering high processing speeds at an affordable price and allowing for simple and reliable use of Open Source software. The presented system uses a microcontroller with a standard Ethernet interface, to validate users presenting a compatible Ibutton or RFID Card. The user credentials are validated locally or in a central database. Authorized users are given access to reserved areas. By using a powerful database, very flexible and complex high level administration and management functions can be implemented. By sharing the local IP network infrastructure, maximum commonality and flexibility are achieved. Both microcontroller and database server software are fully implemented using Open Source developing tools.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556614","Access Control;Education;Embedded Systems;Ethernet;RFID;TCP/IP","Servers;Access control;Computer architecture;Hardware;Embedded system;Databases","","1","","15","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper presents a new approach based on this technology, in which agents show intelligent behavior thanks to the use of a rule-based expert system. Moreover, the interaction between agents occurs within the context of Breeding Environments, a concept associated with networked organizations.

Informatics is by turn a driver, an enabler, and sometimes a constraint of change. Informatics professionals need to be equipped to govern and lead not just IS/IT change but wider business change. In 2009 BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT in the UK, formed a Business Change Specialist Group, bringing together informatics and change management researchers and professionals. BCS has also commissioned research into the role of informatics professionals in initiating, prioritizing and leading business change. Businesses typically lack structures to manage change holistically across the enterprise. Informatics professionals tend to have a broad view across the organization, giving then a more holistic perspective on change than many of their colleagues. They have a wider role to play, centre-stage, not only in initiating and leading informatics change, but in integrating multiple concurrent change initiatives.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556611","organization;change;holistic;leadership;IT;professional","Informatics;Organizations;Lead;Presses;Portfolios","","","","42","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an analysis of non technical skills required for a variety of IT (Information Technology) positions and areas based on data extracted from more than 3000 ICT job offers published in Spain during the last years. Requirements are also compared with those expressed as requirements for telco engineers and industrial engineers.

Although research on methods and techniques for data quality assessment and improvement have begun in the early nineties of the past century and being currently abundant and innovative, it is noted that the academic and professional communities virtually have no dialogue, which turns out to be harmful to both of them. The challenge of promoting the relevance in information systems research, without compromising the necessary rigor, is still present in the various disciplines of information systems scientific area, including the data quality one. In this paper we present “data as a corporate asset” as a business philosophy, and a framework for the concepts related to that philosophy, derived from the academic and professional literature. According to this framework, we present, analyze and discuss a single explanatory case study, developed in a fixed and mobile telecommunications company, operating in one of the European Union Countries. The results show that, in the absence of data stewardship roles, data quality problems become more of an ""IT problem"" than typically is considered in the literature, owing to Requirements Analysis Teams of the IS Development Units, to become a “quality negotiator” between the various stakeholders. Other findings are their bottom-up approach to data quality management, their biggest focus on motivating employees through innovative forms of communication, which appears to be a critical success factor (CSF) for data quality management, as well as the importance of a data quality champion leadership.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556606","data quality management;framework;data quality initiative;case study","Quality management;Data models;Companies;Context;Process control","","","","43","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Creating a truly adaptive AI would greatly benefit a videogame's intrinsic value by providing a more immersive and unpredictable game experience.

Robotic Soccer is very appropriate for researching in Distributed AI problems, e.g. coordination methodologies, whose results can later be applied to other domains. Coordination can be defined as the capability of several agents to work together as a team, in order to accomplish a common goal. In the context of robotic soccer, several aspects may benefit from appropriate coordination methodologies, since team play is decisive for winning the games. This paper presents a methodology to enable a team of robotic soccer agents to coordinate their positioning in the field, and a methodology that enables them to cooperatively execute predefined set plays (flexible plans). Both coordination methods are used in real soccer and sports in general, commonly known as formations and set plays respectively. However, its use in a team of autonomous agents is still unexplored and is a major innovation of this work. A graphical tool to define formations and set plays was fully developed in the context of this work offering a quicker and more appealing way to define both formations and set plays. The tool's interface was inspired on ”blackboard” applications, used nowadays for the same purpose in real sports. The tool enables very easy definition of set plays that may then be executed in real-time during the matches. Examples of complete set plays and their practical execution are also described, showing the usefulness of the set play concept and the utility of the developed tool.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-3-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556598","","Robot kinematics;Artificial intelligence;Robot sensing systems;Games;Servers;Lead","","2","","15","","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, virtual pheromones are used to represent the agent's internal representation of the world. They can be repulsive or attractive and therefore useful for exploration, collision avoidance and world analysis. The project's goal is to evaluate this approach suitability in the aforementioned competition's context. To accomplish this, the authors have created a fully pheromone-based agent and inserted it in CyberRescue's competition, evaluating its behavior by the contest's rules. This approach yields excellent results in open maps, even when wall placement is complex. On the other hand, the agent's behavior is unstable and limited when it has to cross narrow corridors to explore new areas and find the goal. In the competition's context, it proves itself as being an excellent exploratory strategy with a very low collision rate, while allowing the agents to successfully complete a considerable amount of maps.
