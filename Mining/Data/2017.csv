Their use in organizations has become crucial in the treatment of large data volumes, and providing relevant information, in order to assertively support decision-making. This article presents the design of a data mart for the financial resources of a public organism with the objective of responding to the data visualization and processing needs of the respective organism. Posteriorly a prototype was developed with the objective of evaluating, through the TAM model, the usability, utility and easiness of use. The sample chosen to evaluate this data mart and the respective data processing was made up of university students who attended the curricular unit of Business Intelligence II and who had the knowledge to do this evaluation.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975672","Business Intelligence;Public Sector;Data Warehouse;Financial Department;Data Mart;TAM Model","Business intelligence;Data warehouses;Data visualization;Data models;Computational modeling;Organizations;Organisms","","","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although this setup is present in many examples of telerobotic applications, it may not be suitable in situations when it is not possible or desirable to have manual input devices, or when the operator has a motor disability that does not allow the use of that type of input devices. Since the operator already uses his/her eyes in the monitoring task, an interface based on the inputs from their gaze could be used to teleoperate the robot. This paper presents a telerobotic platform that uses a user interface based on eye-gaze tracking that enables a user to control the navigation of a teleoperated mobile robot using only his/her eyes as inputs to the system. Details of the operation of the eye-gaze tracking system and the results of a task-oriented evaluation of the developed system are also included.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975673","Mobile Robot;Teleoperation Interface;Human-Robot Interaction;Eye-Gaze Tracking","Robot sensing systems;Telerobotics;User interfaces;Mobile robots;Cameras;Monitoring","","11","","21","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This determination is made available to any user through a web-based executable program made by the authors that computes the velocity, following common theory. This study is an instance of computing over the Web, a way of computing that employs exactly the same executable programs as classical computing, these being typically the hard task in most Engineering and other problems. This type of computing, with the corresponding tailored executables, can be used to solve innumerable other problems.

Any change in temperature can cause a damage in the specific properties in products. Because of that, it is mandatory to constantly monitor temperature and log it to offer traceability. Furthermore, if products must be transported, the position coordinates should be taken into account as well, due to the possibility of making mistakes in logistics personnel, taking non-optimal routes to arrive to the destination, and increasing transportation time. Thus, logistics managers need tools to measure, save and analyze temperature and position in real time to make the most optimal decisions. The implementation of systems meeting Ubiquitous Computing can fulfill the challenge, because the generated information is available to be read, modified and stored everywhere and every time. Besides, messengers can be warned about anomalies regarding change of temperatures or coordinates, adding context awareness to the system. This work aims to show a novel architecture to monitor cold chains by using Ubiquitous Computing paradigm, by means of Single Board Computers. The system includes instrumentation, embedded processing with Single Board Computers, real time databases, Human Computer Interfaces, remote management and support to deploy a complete solution. By using this system, companies ensure traceability and integrity of data in cold chains.

As such, messages (called bundles) can be stored in buffers for a long time. Network congestion can result in poor delivery rates, as bundles are dropped before having a chance of reaching their destination. Some routing protocols, such as the Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity (PRoPHET), maintain estimations of delivery probabilities for each destination. In this paper, a new drop policy called Largest Bundle's Hosts Deliverability (LBHD) is proposed that considers all the hosts that received a replica of the same bundle, and their respective delivery probability as estimated by PRoPHET. LBHD uses this additional information to better manage congestion. Simulation results show that LBHD achieves the best delivery probability when compared with other drop policies proposed in the literature. The LBHD policy achieved an average delivery rate 37% better than the default Drop Head (FIFO) policy at the price of a 21% increased average delay.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975686","Delay Tolerant Networks;Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks;Drop policies;PRoPHET;LEPR;MOPR;LBHD","High definition video;Routing protocols;Delays;Buffer storage;Estimation","","","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With an increasingly dominant role in our days, Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological revolution that is changing our lives. The imagination is the limit regarding the new devices that may arise in the market. This phenomenon is derived from technology evolution and the growing acceptance of this type of products in our everyday life. Faced with such diversity, growing and with the existing uncertainty about the new devices emerging in the market, there is a need to integrate each new device in our lives. However, nowadays, there is no existing structure prepared for the expectable emerging diversity in the IoT world. This work aims to provide some help in this specific point by contributing to the automation of part of the device integration process. Applications that integrate devices from many different vendors are now available, but still rely on manual configuration by the application developers for every new device integrated, which is tedious and requires application updates to be rolled out frequently. An application that can discover the new device properties, and decide to which class of devices it belongs to can automatically generate an interface and the necessary integration drivers for the new device with no/less human intervention. The demonstration that it is possible to classify devices based on their communication properties is this works' main contribution. To achieve this goal we need to identify the device that is communicating inside a network using the information shared by IoT devices. The final results show that IoT communication data can be used to identify the device, mainly if in possession of a considerable sized device information database.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975691","Internet of Things;Discovery;Integration;Automation","Internet of Things;Protocols;Companies;Hardware;Google;Home automation","","7","1","23","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementing a multi-model environment for software process improvement is not an easy task since it demands the harmonization of models or standards with dissimilar structures, hence diagnosing the maturity of an organization that defines and implements a multi-model environment it not an easy task either. This work depicts a software tool to accomplish a diagnostic of an organization that uses or pretends to define a software process improvement multi-model environment that includes both traditional and agile models and standards.

One of the great difficulties that students face when they start a curricular unit linked to programming is to acquire skills which allow them solving real life problems through the use of algorithms. Such skills require the development of the ability to abstract as well as to apply algorithms development techniques. These difficulties are even greater when students attend to a course that does not have as main objective the programming of computers and their basic education is on non-technological areas. As a result of the difficulty in obtaining these competences, there are high failure and dropout rates in courses related to this study field. In order to solve this problem, we propose a methodology based on VARK questionnaire and students background to define the students' profile and, consequently, define what are the appropriate educational materials and tools. To validate this model, a pilot experiment with students to be divided into two groups was carried out, in the academic year 2015-2016, with the application of the model to one of them. In the end, it was found that the final results obtained in the group where the proposed methodology was applied were superior.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975718","algorithms;programms;VARK questionnaire;methodology;instructional materials;didactic tools","Education;Programming profession;Tools;Taxonomy;Prediction algorithms;Adaptation models","","1","","21","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Education is not foreign to these changes. Genuine concepts such as collaborative learning, massive courses (MOOC) or flipped classrooms have been incorporated at every educational level, although the maturity of students allows a greater capacity for innovation at higher education. Together with these concepts, new technological tools have been employed with educational purposes. In particular, wikis have been reported as ideally suited for collaborative learning. Thus, nowadays, several Universities around the world are running projects and events about the use of wikis in higher education. Therefore, in this paper we explore the use of wikis in the higher educational institutions, being focused on a special case: Wikipedia. Wikipedia presents special characteristics which make it perfect to reach not only the specific learning objectives of a certain particular subject, but also the transversal abilities so demanded today (such as teamwork or social responsibility). The research methodology followed is based on a review and update of the collaboration between the University and the Wikipedia. In particular, we analyze the collaboration of the Spanish and Hispanic American Universities in its different manifestations. In this work, we explain the most interesting results about this collaboration. We observe one increasingly activity over this collaboration due to the greater number of universities that are incorporated, especially in the last five years.

In this paper, we describe our approach to recognize hand configurations in real time with the purpose of providing accurate predictions to be used in automatic sign language translation. To capture the hand configuration we rely on data gloves with 14 sensors that measure finger joints bending. These inputs are sampled at a frequency of 100Hz and fed to a classifier that predicts the current hand configuration. The classification model is created from an annotated sample of hand configurations previously acquired. We expect this approach to be accurate and robust in the sense that the performance of the classification model should not vary significantly when the classifier is being used by one or another user. The results from our experimental evaluation show that there is a very high accuracy, meaning that data gloves are a good approach to capture the descriptive features of hand configurations. However, the robustness of such an approach is not as good as desirable since the accuracy of the classifier depends on the user, i.e., the accuracy is high when the classifier is used by a user who trained it but decreases in other cases.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975724","sign language;deaf;sensor sloves;classification","Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Support vector machines;Sensors;Training;Data gloves;Robustness","","3","","17","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first method from multi-spectral image and image acquired with the UAV get the intensity of the multispectral image (Im) and the intensity of UAV (Iv), using the RGB-IHS transformation respectively. Then applying fusion to the intensity components of Im and Iv using Wavelet transform together with ARSIS' technique to genere a new intensity (n_Imv). This n_Imv together with hue and saturation obtained from Ikonos image are transformed inversely to generate a new multispectral image (N-MULT-I). In the second process a new panchromatic is created through of average of three RGB bands of UAV's image (fpan), then fusion is applied using wavelet transform to Im and fpan to generate a new intensity (n_Ifpm). Using n_Ifpm and hue and saturation components of IKonos image a new image multispectral is generated (N-MULT-fpan). Finally, results are shown and there are evaluated with Correlation Coefficient, ERGAS, RASE and Qu.

To analyze this phenomenon, a two-dimensional (2D) simplified analysis is currently used, although it offers a mathematical approximation to the solution of the problem, their results significantly reduce the accuracy of the physical model. This article shows an algorithm developed to model the three - dimensional (3D) soil arching effect on the gravel of Santiago de Chile. The algorithm is implemented in a finite element software. This methodology provides more accurate results in the models, which considerably reduces the risk of landslides and optimizes the use of resources in the construction of discontinuous retaining structures. With this contribution it is also possible to establish a new design algorithm for the use of structural engineers that are more accuracy in their results with greater precision in calculations, due to the three-dimensional (3D) model developed.

This is no different with source code metrics, where there is always new metric classes. To use a software metric to support decisions, it is necessary to understand how to perform the metric collection, calculation, interpretation, and analysis. The tasks of collecting and calculating source code metrics are most often automated, but how should we monitor them during the software development cycle? Our research aims to assist the software engineer to monitor metrics of vulnerability threats present in the source code through a reference prediction model, considering that real world software have non-functional security requirements, which implies the need to know how to monitor these requirements during the software development cycle. As a first result, this paper presents an empirical study on the evolution of the Linux project. Based on static analysis data, we propose low complexity models to study flaws in the Linux source code. About 391 versions of the project were analyzed by mining the official Linux repository using an approach that can be reproduced to perform similar studies. Our results show that it is possible to predict the number of warnings triggered by a static analyzer for a given software project revision as long as the software is continuously monitored.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975747","Source Code Static Analysis;Source Code Metrics;Common Weakness Enumeration;Prediction;Linux","Software;Linux;Complexity theory;Predictive models;Data models;Measurement;Monitoring","","","","23","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices and a Smartphone acting as a server the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination. By performing maneuvers through an aerial circuit filled with obstacles the proposed UAV simulator encourages motor and mental activity while the user is being entertained. The result is the improvement of the user quality of life by avoiding cognitive and physical sedentarism.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975750","UAV;Virtual Reality;Grown-up people;Drone;Unity","Drones;Bluetooth;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Software;Hardware","","2","","17","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students must contribute to science through scientific publications in congresses and journals, increasing the institution levels. However, predicting its performance demand advisor's experience and time. The advisors must select from a group of projects which one is the best for both sides. This procedure can lead to wrong choices. With the purpose of enhancing the selection process of masters' students, this paper presents an analysis of the academic characteristics of master's education applicants. It was used to identify set of features that might help to predict an applicant's scientific production. Through the process of Knowledge Discovery in Database, was obtained a set of correlation rules between features and the expected applicant's performance. Data collection was made on the Lattes Platform (A Brazilian platform to Scientific Curricula). Then, after pre-processed, it was optimized using the Partition Around Medoids with Gower distance. Experiments were conducted by training seven classification algorithms in two approaches. The first was a naive approach, making the analysis as simple as possible and the second one, develop an optimized process of DM. The optimization used the clustering process to create a new main class for the classifiers. Results demonstrate that the optimized approach was able to achieve an accuracy around 85% using the Random Forest, while the naive has approximately 44%. Through the PAM algorithm, it was possible to determine the best attributes and highlight the main rules. The conclusion is that the category of University and their previous production was the most relevant attributes. It shows that is possible to predict the productivity of master's degree students.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975752","KDD;Curriculum Analysis;Student performance;Master Education","Production;Databases;Classification algorithms;Registers;Algorithm design and analysis;Training;Radio frequency","","3","","20","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We will discuss how the ontology definition drives the way SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) queries extract information from the TripleStore to be prepared for visualization. However, to enable this approach, we need to populate the ontology in an automatic way, extracting the data from the annotated documents in the institution repository.

In this study, we present such analysis encompassing the last four editions, between 2013 and 2016, and a total of 677 articles. To accomplish such challenge more efficiently, we adopted text mining. We assessed through topic modeling how the unveiled research trends are aligned with the main conference themes. Data-driven empirical research has proven it is still a hot subject for researchers. Likewise, education and learning are also playing a significant role in CISTI's contributions. Notwithstanding, Internet and social media are highly relevant topics for the conference, although not figuring as major themes. On the other side, health is receiving less attention. Thus, this study can lead to recommendations for future CISTI's themes, in addition to providing an overview of current research trends.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975765","CISTI;text mining;literature analysis;research trends;topic modeling","Market research;Text mining;Knowledge engineering;Data models;Information systems;Analytical models;Dictionaries","","3","","13","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing has reinvented how organizations conduct business and has enabled them to innovate and compete in a dynamic environment through new and innovative business models. The growing popularity and success of the cloud has led to the emergence of cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ERP systems, a new alternative approach to traditional on-premise ERP systems. Cloud-based ERP has a myriad of benefits for organizations. However, infrastructure engineers need to address data security issues before moving their enterprise applications to the cloud. Cloud-based ERP raises specific concerns about the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the cloud. Such concerns that affect the adoption of cloud-based ERP are based on the size of the organization. Small to medium enterprises (SMEs) gain the maximum benefits from cloud-based ERP as many of the concerns around data security are not relevant to them. On the contrary, larger organizations are more cautious in moving their mission critical enterprise applications to the cloud. A hybrid solution where organizations can choose to keep their sensitive applications on-premise while leveraging the benefits of the cloud is proposed in this paper as an effective solution that is gaining momentum and popularity for large organizations.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975779","ERP;cloud computing;Cloud ERP;SaaS;data security;confidentiality;integrity","Cloud computing;Organizations;Software as a service;Data security;Computational modeling","","11","","31","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, before they can become an effective communication medium, they need to move towards more open models, where users are able to contribute with their own content. The key challenge is how to share control with users while being able to guarantee that published content matches the social expectations of a place. The key contribution of this work is a wide perspective of the key moderation approaches described in the literature for pre-moderation and post-moderation. We have taken a comprehensive approach that uncovers the broad range of techniques that can be applied to support moderation of user-generated content, highlighting their specificities and how they can complement each other to provide a comprehensive approach to moderation in these scenarios. This should help display owners to reason about the combination of techniques that is able to reduce risk to a level that is deemed acceptable, while minimising the moderation effort and the impact on the willingness of users to publish their content.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975786","public displays;media;content moderation;interactive displays;user-generated content","User-generated content;Media;Social network services;Systematics;Concrete;Urban areas","","4","","19","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The production of such a guide can contribute to facilitate OER adoption and implementation processes in basic education. The relevance of applying OER in basic education is justified by its importance as an instrument to improve teaching by favouring co-learning through experience exchanges between teachers and students, between students, and between students and resources, as well as by providing more autonomy to students by allowing them to decide what, when, and through which medium to study.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975790","Open Educational Resources;Basic Education;Open Education;Copyright;Creative Commons","Instruments;Production;Open Educational Resources;Art;Portals;History","","","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This demand requires that higher education institutions prepare their graduates adequately, not only in technical skills, but also in terms of the so-called soft skills. In this paper, we describe a strategy that is being implemented, in recent years, in two higher education Information and Communication Technologies courses. In it, several practices were adopted that we believe will lead to a successful preparation of students, not only on a technical level, but also in terms of the acquisition of knowledge and best practices regarding best teamwork methodologies. Employers' feedback has been essential for the implementation of this strategy, since it has allowed us to evaluate how it facilitates the integration of recent graduates, after being recruited, and the issues that influence that integration. We can conclude that, for a successful integration, there is an important contribution, not only from the technical knowledge and abilities they acquired, but also from a diverse set of behavioral aspects related to interpersonal relations, motivation, attitude towards challenges, among others. The approach we propose is aimed at guiding the training of finalist students in order to facilitate their integration into a future work environment. Our purpose with this paper is to share this experience, which we evaluate as positive, with those who work in the area and thus contribute to the desired Academy-Business proximity.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975799","Agile;project;education;Employability;soft skills","Software;Information and communication technology;Best practices;Teamwork;Training;Nanoelectromechanical systems","","","","7","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software rejuvenation is the countermeasure of software aging. Rejuvenation actions usually comprise system reboot or application restart. Software aging appears as a significant concern for the reliability of software systems. Therefore, techniques and methods to analyze software aging and rejuvenation are of utmost importance. This paper proposes an approach based on experiments and empirical observation to investigate aging and rejuvenation on software systems. The approach has three phases: (i) Stress Phase - stress environment with the accelerated workload to induce bugs activation; (ii) Wait - stop workload submission to observe impact caused in software status; (iii) Rejuvenation Phase - submit rejuvenation action to perceive changes in the software internal state. To validate the proposed approach this paper presents a case study. This case study consists of an experiment of VM Live Migration as rejuvenation mechanism for VMM software aging. The considered testbed is a private Cloud with OpenNebula and KVM 1.0. The obtained results show that VM live migration is effective as rejuvenation for VMM software aging.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975806","Software Aging and Rejuvenation;Reliability;Dependability;Cloud Computing","Aging;Stress;Virtual machine monitors;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Random access memory","","6","","20","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In both hospitals, the SIs of the clinical analysis and radiology departments and their integrations with the hospital's central IS were analyzed. The integrations use the HL7 standard that is widely used for the communication of data between the various computer systems in health institutions in Portugal. From the HL7 messages exchanged by the analyzed SI, the segments MSH, PID, PV1, OBR, ORC and MSA were observed. Our results allow us to conclude that the quality of integrations in terms of completeness of required and conditional fields is similar in the two hospitals analyzed (90% in A and 91% in B).

Cancer registries can retrieve and store information on all cancer cases occurring in a defined population. The main sources of data on cancer cases usually include: treatment and diagnostic facilities (oncology centres or hospital departments, pathology laboratories, or imaging facilities etc.) and the official territorial death registry. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the north regional cancer registry (RORENO) of Portugal using a qualitative research. We want to characterize: the main functionalities and core processes, team involved, different healthcare institutions in the regional network and an identification of issues and potential improvements. RORENO links data of thirteen-two healthcare institutions and is responsible for the production of cancer incidence and survival report for this region. In our semi-structure interviews and observation of RORENO we identified a serious problem due to a lack of an automatic integration of data from the different sources. Most of the data are inserted manually in the system and this implies an extra effort from the RORENO team. At this moment RORENO team are still collecting data from 2011. In a near future it is crucial to automatize the integration of data linking the different healthcare institutions in the region. However, it is important to think which functionalities this system should give to the institutions in the network to maximize the engagement with the project. More than a database this should be a source of knowledge available to all the collaborative oncologic network.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975827","cancer registries;information system;qualitative research;BPMN;qualitative research;semi-structure interview;observation","Cancer;Europe;Hospitals;Interviews;Information systems;Databases","","1","","23","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What we call human reality approaches fantasy realms in the virtual worlds. The aim of this study is to explore what animated films transmit to an adult population - what they feel and what they value in animated films, trying to understand the importance of animated films in adults' lives. It is also intended to explore which technologies are most used to consult information about animated films, and which are the most important reasons for choosing an animated film, instead of other styles of movies. Our study consists in the development of two focus groups, with adult participants, between 25 and 35 years. This study is part of a master's thesis that is under development. Through the focus group we aim to obtain data and gather knowledge about our research topic.

Data fusion processes present opportunities to improve the SAW of operators of risk assessment systems. However, dynamic scenarios are subject to uncertainties, especially when the data are derived from human intelligence (HUMINT). The state of the art in data and information fusion techniques presents approaches restricted to syntactic and/or pragmatic mechanisms for determining synergy between information, negatively influencing the results of the fusion.

Open access is access free of technical, legal or financial restrictions. Websites that provide open access must meet web accessibility standards in order to minimize the barriers that impede access to information for people with disabilities. However, web developers often do not have the knowledge to meet web accessibility standards. Several evaluation tools have been developed to verify that a website complies with web accessibility standards. In this article we present the results of an analysis of the web accessibility of 101 websites of scientific journals with open access in Latin America. EXaminator has been used as an automatic evaluation tool to detect the most important problems of web accessibility.

Cloud computing services are offered by providers and can be classified into three modalities: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). In IaaS, the providers offer services divided into instances. With this, the user has a virtual machine at their disposal with the computational resources desired at a given cost. The main challenge faced by companies is to choose what is the best pricing plan (instance/provider) to supply their computational demand. Frequently, these companies need a large computational infrastructure to manage and improve their business processes and, due to the high cost of maintaining local infrastructure, they have begun to migrate applications to the cloud. This work aims to provide insights that can help companies in selection process of the best provider/instance to deploy and execute integrations solutions in the cloud. For this, a preliminary study to construction of a new proposal for price modeling of instances of virtual machines using linear regression is presented.

Using an existing dataset composed of health web documents, relevance judgments for information needs, user and task characteristics, we build a multivariate prediction model for situational relevance. Our model has an accuracy of 77.17%. Our findings provide insights into features that could improve the estimation of relevance by search engines, helping to conciliate the systemic and situational views of relevance.

This is one important issue, which can prevent companies and organizations from adopting federated clouds. In this context, this paper focuses on the problem of access control in federated clouds. Our proposal uses an attribute-based model of access control to decide whether a user can access a given resource. Besides, to evaluate the performance of our model, we performed experiments using a federated cloud specifically designed for bioinformatics application, called BioNimbuZ. The obtained results showed that our model efficiently and effectively restrict access to resources, and could be extended to other applications as well.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975855","cloud computing;federated clouds;security;access control;BioNimbuZ","Cloud computing;Access control;Biological system modeling;Computer architecture;Companies;Computational modeling","","2","","21","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the design of a serious game it is necessary, among other matters, to define the requirements that will be in the game, adapting the motivational resources of the games and the learning goals in a coherent way. In this paper are presented the results of an exploratory analysis on the subject through an opinion survey whose objective was to investigate the interest of potential players in different aspects of games and the use of serious games. The results indicate functional and nonfunctional requirements that can provide more effectiveness in the application of games as a tool to support learning.

The results show that the success determinants are different according to the crowdfunding area. In the area of Music, the key factors that contribute positively to the success of financing a project are the number of views per project and the level of requested amount per project. In the area of Sports, the factors that explain the success are the number of images per project, the runtime project and being connected online by Facebook and the factors that explain its failure are the time period to launch a project: failure occurs more often for projects launched by March/April or September/October.

These new behaviours, that include choices and interactions made by the users (actions like accept, discard and/or moving to the next user), as well as the standardized and algorithmically mediated choices made by the apps algorithms, brought to life new scenarios related to info-communicational behaviours. Therefore, the swipe culture and user centered design (UCD) triggered these new habits and behaviours, that were made possible by the features offered by mobile dating applications.

This model is intended to enable the internationalization (i18n) in a database, thus facilitating the work of both the database developer as well as the translator which performs its localization (l10n). The use of this model should reduce the developer's effort and allow the translator not to worry about application implementation details. On the other hand, with this model it will be possible to do l10n maintenance keeping the database online. We have implemented an internal module for the database engine that allows the detachment of all the elements dependent on the country language and culture being used. This detachment makes the elements' source independent enough so that its components can be edited by a translator without any databases knowledge and refilled at run time, i.e. with the database in full operation. This also allows new sources to be added for different cultures and languages. The proposed model may be useful for several types of applications, an interesting example would be in the development of business applications where much of its rules and validations that defines the company's business is applied at the database level. With this solution for database internationalization it is not necessary to create specific tables, relations and any other needed database objects, which requires more expensive query and maintenance methods.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975869","Software localization;internationalization model;database;business application","Databases;Software;Java;Business;Maintenance engineering;Cultural differences;Load modeling","","","","14","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Web localization constitutes a new field of study and professional intervention. From the translation perspective, localization equates to the Web site being adjusted to the typological, discursive and genre conventions of the target culture, adapting that website to a different language and culture. This entails much more than simply translating the content of the pages. The content of a Web page is made up of text, images and other multimedia elements, all of which have to be translated and subjected to cultural adaptation. A case study has been carried out to analyze the current presence of localization within Spanish SMEs from the chemical sector. Two types of indicator have been established for evaluating the sample: indicators for evaluating company Web sites (with a Likert scale from 0-4) and indicators for evaluating Web localization (0-2 scale). The results show overall website quality is acceptable (2.5 points out of 4). The higher rating has been obtained by the system quality (with 2.9), followed by information quality (2.7 points) and, lastly, service quality (1.9 points). In the web localization evaluation, the contact information aspects obtain 1.4 points, the visual aspect 1.04, and the navigation aspect was the worse considered (0.37). These types of analysis facilitate the establishment of practical recommendations aimed at SMEs in order to increase their international presence through the localization of their Web sites.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975872","Web localization;enterprises;internationalization;Spanish SMEs;chemical sector","Companies;Chemicals;Economics;Globalization;Europe;Social network services","","1","","27","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This material is aimed at professionals working in Distance Education (DE) who are interested in discussing social interactions in the virtual. The objective is to discuss social interactions as an important factor to be included in pedagogical practices developed in Virtual Learning Environments (VEL). SocioAVA consists of four modules, bringing cases that can contextualize, discuss and exemplify social interactions in pedagogical practices in DE. In each module are explanatory texts and support materials such as videos, presentations, animations, audios, hypertexts, infographics, among others. To help in the discussion about the content in question, activities are also proposed in the form of challenges in order to problematize the topics addressed. For the development of SocioAVA digital educational material, an interdisciplinary team composed of educators, programmers, musicians and web designers was involved. The methodology adopted was ConstruMED in which it is focused on the construction of Digital Educational Materials (DEM) based on pedagogical design. This methodology is composed of five stages: Preparation, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation and Distribution. The application of DEM will occur in undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the area of Education. It is intended to test the operation of the material, its degree of adequacy to the target audience and level of achievement of the objectives, verifying the operation and to analyze if the DEM was in agreement with the technical, functional and didactic characteristics that are included in the project. It is understood that in DE is extremely important the appreciation of the student's role in learning, since at various moments is physically distant from the teacher and colleagues. In this way, the constant interaction between the actors of the VEL is fundamental for the pedagogical success in this modality.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975876","Social Interactions;Distance Education;Digital Educational Material","Education;Planning;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Videos;Animation;Visualization;Software","","","","9","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerous studies propose the adoption of agile methods as the most appropriate ones, given their flexibility to adapt to such a changing context. However, due to the highly evolutionary character of this type of environments, there is little scientific evidence to support a clear idea of how the development and management of these projects is carried out in organizations. The incorporation of maturity models in mobile application development would allow organizations to have a thorough knowledge of the subject and to carry out improvements in their development process. A fundamental aspect of the quality in mobile applications is usability, which can only be attained by introducing user-centered design criteria in the development process. In this paper, we set forth the development of a usability maturity model in the mobile application development process.

This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975882","ICT;hospital management;BI;BHSC;hospital indicators","Hospitals;Business intelligence;Silicon;Data warehouses;Tools;Information and communication technology;Monitoring","","","","22","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The theoretical framework addresses social networks as online communication concept and how it transforms social structures through the interaction between users. In the context of empirical research was applied a questionnaire asking 322 users of social networks in general. It check that users perceive the photographs with some frequency, enjoying and commenting on them, particularly when they involve the presence of close people (friends and family). In contrast, with regard to archiving and sharing of online photo, family members are less valued, it is more privileged associations with objects and landscapes.

With this app, we aim at present a training assistive tool to be used by the user, in a daily situation, where the main asset is the feedback about the rate of correct pronunciation, thus allowing users to train, autonomously, at home. Additionally, we present a preliminary user study to assess usability of the proposed application. For that, we invited a group of people with speech impairments to perform training tasks with the application. In the assessment, we register the following parameters: effectiveness (successful conclusion of the training tasks and percentage of pronouncing success); efficiency (number of errors made, number and type of difficulties found); and, satisfaction (the acceptance and comfort to complete the training tasks). Overall, the preliminary results showed that participants achieved an efficiency rate of 53.4% in the accomplishment of the proposed tasks. On average, for each image, participants missed at least 2 times, where the most registered difficulty was the pronunciation of words with accents. Regarding satisfaction, we noticed that they like it as they ask not only to repeat the test but also the addition of more pictures to perform more tests with the proposed web application.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975889","Web application;speech impairments;speech recognition;assistive technologies;user tests","Training;Speech;Visualization;Australia;Usability;Speech recognition;Servers","","1","","15","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that purpose, a mobile application with a gamification approach was designed to identify users' behaviors towards the use of energy and, based on the user's answers, offer advices to save energy and promote ecological awareness. The outcome of using gamification on a mobile application with such goals results in a streamlined data collection application that combines information and entertainment.

However, this approach creates rigid (or hard) processes, which are only valid in certain scenarios. The inclusion of legacy systems, new Industry 4.0 devices and, overall, humans as part of CPS, has caused the appearance of new paradigms which cannot be addressed with traditional execution techniques. Therefore, in this paper a new type of (soft) processes, designed to be employed in humanized CPS, is presented.

Prevention in this area of health is, increasingly, a fundamental aspect for the improvement of the quality of life of each one and the public health in general. The objective of the present study is to understand how stress can be continuously monitored, especially in individuals who perform occupations that present a high risk of stress, in order to predict and alert the occurrence of chronic or pathological stress and burnout situations. For this purpose a non-invasive measurement instrument will be developed for the individual using biometric signals, measured through a wearable device, collected in a mobile device and later sent to an information system that will handle this information. In the experiment carried out, a prototype of a mobile application was developed that synchronizes the data coming from smartbands directly linked to the individuals with smartphones, to continuously monitor the physical and quality of life related to the health of the person. Of course, data collection is only of importance if the data are analyzed with consequent production of results for the individual and health professionals. Some technologies normally used to elaborate a system of this magnitude will also be analyzed and, with the support of the health professionals and individuals for whom the evaluation is intended, various forms of feedback on stress levels will be evaluated in order to develop a set of Dashboards with information of stress, distinguishing the information destined to the professional of health of that made available to the own individual.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975904","Wearable;Mobile;Sensores;Data Visualization","Stress;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Smart phones;Instruments;Software;Navigation","","1","","22","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has led to the development of new technological tools that have been able to cover this demand, and one is the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) project. This project starts as an alternative to synchronous communication or in real-time P2P (Peer-to-Peer) in web applications with the advantage that it does not require any additional software. However, this technology does not provide a mechanism for automatically reestablishing in a communication session after a disconnection with the transmission device. This work shows a solution of automatic reconnection of communication session and reduction of lost information during a disconnection over wireless networks. Using a mechanism that evaluates the communication channel's behavior with a statistical analysis and based on the implementation of proxies with Software agents in the ARW (Automatic Reconnection WebRTC) architecture, and it uses as research methodology the Design Science Research DSR. The initial achievements obtained by evaluating the ARW architecture in a controlled test environment show that this contribution allows to reestablish communication, reduce the lost information, and does not affect the user experience when it retrieves the session after a disconnection.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975909","WebRTC;P2P;disconnection;session;wireless;proxies","WebRTC;Streaming media;Irrigation;Jitter;Peer-to-peer computing;Silicon compounds","","","","19","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, not all information on services is fully accessible. The difficulty in keeping track of changes in services' costs causes delays and can result in waste of time and money. In fact, the decision of which service to use usually involves some level of uncertainty and risk. Hence, the user should have access to some form of decision support system that could be easily available through mobile applications. The power of these devices allows to apply knowledge areas already developed, carrying statistics with dynamic and interactive graphics, thus allowing for a more systematic control of services and corresponding expenses. In this work we analyze the existing related work on mobile decision support systems and propose an architecture of a decision support system using Mobile App Statistics. Tests were carried out with a car fuel app to support the decision of choosing the gas station at each point. Results show that using the additional statistical information provided users can take better decisions during the request of a service.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975910","Mobile computing;Statistics;Decision support systems","Fuels;Decision support systems;Time series analysis;Decision making;Mobile communication;Knowledge based systems;Computer architecture","","","","15","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, the society benefits from new forms of communication, either through social networks or through the availability of online content and services, according to the characteristics of real-time speed of the information process. Thus, on the one hand, the citizen who is more exposed to the criminal reality, is also more protected. On the other hand, the police forces obtain information faster and because they have a security management tool, they can act effective and efficiently. Methodologically, in the theoretical analysis, this article is supported in the strategy of social responsibility integrated with the policy of disclosure of the police forces, in the perspective of citizenship and accountability. In the empirical analysis it reflects the good practices in this field of each police force integrated in EUROGENDFOR.

The M-BOFP takes advantage of the Bloom filters, a probabilistic data structure with low memory cost, to carry information of multicast groups requiring low and fixed message overhead. This paper presents preliminary results of the comparative analysis between the MBOFP and its precursor the BOFP. For this analysis, we carry out a performance evaluation of the proposed protocol considering different scenarios representing small, moderate and large-scale networks.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975930","WSAN;Routing;Delivery Efficienc;Multicast;Bloom Filters","Actuators;Routing;Routing protocols;Unicast;Data structures;Relays","","","","15","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major contributions to development is the creation of economic clusters that are used together to achieve specific objectives. This consists of identifying business groups, companies, or muncipalities that are spacely disseminated. In this research, we propose a methodolgy, focuses on the results of thematic space analysis to obtain dynamic clusters that have a direct relationship with social associations. The results shows that there is a direct relationship between business potential and centroid groups, which are not excusively tied to distances between places. Although this work is only in its development stages, one of the primary conclusions is that it is possile to take advantage of the centroid space for group collaboration, which will help us to carry out future researchs in this field, and which will be addressed in other lab work.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975942","groups;centroid;collaboration;associations","Economics;Companies;Urban areas;Heuristic algorithms;Biological system modeling;Collaboration","","","","12","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The so-called `drug planes' take off and land on Ecuadorian territory using improvised airstrips, which are not registered by the competent aeronautical authorities. Within these activities have been possible to identify the transfer of illegal substances, economic values for their acquisition or sale and even transfers of personalities involved in international drug trafficking. The specific geography of the region, especially in the Ecuadorian coast and east, is propitious for the adaptation of clandestine airstrips, which, due to their location, vegetation and limitations of access by land, limit the control and identification by the competent authorities.

Despite these improvements, DAA remains vulnerable to some kinds of attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). For this reason, we introduce in this paper a method for testing security of the authentication and the access control schemes based on DAA, called Unauthorized Access based on HTTP Redirection and MitM (UARiM). As an experiment, we applied the method to the remote access system of the Active Management Technology (AMT) - a resource of Intel Core vPro processors.

However, while the latter are supported in several IDEs, code smells detection scaffolding still has many limitations. Another aspect deserving attention is code smells visualization, to increase software quality awareness, namely in large projects, where maintainability is often the dominating issue. Research problems: Researchers have pointed out that code smells detection is inherently a subjective process and that is probably the main hindrance on providing automatic support. Regarding visualization, customized views are required, because each code smell type may have a different scope. Choosing the right visualization for each code smell type is an open research topic. Expected contributions: This research work focuses on the code smells detection and awareness process, by proposing two symbiotic contributions: crowdsmelling and smelly maps. We envisage that such features will be available in a future generation of interactive development environments (aka IDE 2.0). Crowdsmelling uses the concept of collective intelligence through which programmers around the world will collaboratively contribute to the calibration of code smells detection algorithms (one per each code smell), hopefully improving the detection accuracy and mitigating the subjectivity problem. Smelly maps build upon the aforementioned code smells detection capability and on the previous experience at UNIFACS of setting up a software visualization infrastructure. We expect to represent detected code smells at different abstraction levels with the goal of increasing software quality awareness and facilitating refactoring decisions upon large software systems.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975961","Code Smell;Crowdsourcing;Software Quality;Software Construction;Software Maintenance;Code Smells Detection;Crowdsmelling;Smelly Maps;Refactoring;IDE 2.0","Visualization;Tools;Detection algorithms;Training;Data visualization;Software quality","","2","","50","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the Pan-Tompkins algorithm was programmed, and next, a lead-dependent version was implemented, adapting thesholds for each of the ECG channels. The original algorithm was tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, while the performance of the improved technique was tested on the different channels of records from the St. Petersburg Database. For the original Pan-Tompkins algorithm, a sensitivity of Se = 99.81% was obtained, with a positive predictivity (P+) = 99.85%. The F-Score was 0.9587, and the RMS RR Interval Error (RMSRRIE) resulted to be 4,480.46 ms. For the modified algorithm, results yielded an average value for Se = 99.92%, P+ = 99.98%, F-Score = 0.9718, and a mean value of 111.05 ms. for the RMSRRIE.

These predictions of danger situations can be done with the gathering of information concerning the surroundings of the user, in real time. A safe-return-home system should allow the users of the service, to be notified in a timely fashion of possible dangerous situations that occur near the user's location, in real time. These predictions are made through the analysis of various types of data about the surroundings of the user. The data collection and analysis should include information regarding news about crimes, accidents and disasters, and the user's location. Data analysis then allows to predict dangers, so that they can be visually recognized on the user's smartphone, making it possible to respond actively to these dangers, in real time.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975980","Safe return home;user safety","Global Positioning System;Smart phones;Humanoid robots;Safety;Visualization;Monitoring;Big Data","","","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TV Neurones is a computerized cognitive training program for healthy and cognitive impaired older adults. However, there are currently no validation studies with TV Neurones. This study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of TV Neurones. Specifically, it aimed to analyze its acceptability and satisfaction with usability among community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted with a convenience sample. A questionnaire to assess acceptability and the Portuguese version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. Results: Thirty older adults (63,3%female) with a mean age of 67,30±6,67 years old have participated. A global score of 75,50±13,95 was obtained for SUS, indicating a good satisfaction with usability. Concerning acceptability, all the participants have enjoyed using the TV Neurones, considered the exercises as stimulating and the instructions easy to understand, and the program as useful. The majority have reported that TV Neurones allowed to train useful tasks for the daily routines (n=29; 96,7%). However, only 10% of the participants have played more than 10% of the total of games. Conclusions: The TV Neurones have shown good usability and acceptability characteristics. Future research should analyse the impacts of individual and grupal TV Neurones usage on adherence to the program, as well as its effects on older people with cognitive impairment and compare it with more traditional approaches to cognitive training.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975983","ageing;cognitive training;computer-based programs;acceptability;usability","TV;Usability;Training;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Aging;Instruments","","","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, some studies have shown that oil palm cultivation causes enormous damage to the environment by the destruction of existing forests, or by excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, making crude palm oil uncompetitive and strong constraints for its implementation worldwide. To improve the production of crude palm oil, assisted pollination plays a fundamental role in reducing the use of fertilizers. This is why this article presents a flexible Fuzzy ARTMAP model, for the segmentation and identification of oil palm crop units from the characterization of multispectral aerial images. The results show that the proposed model was able to identify complete seed units from polar patterns obtained from the segmentation using grayscale images, as well as the identification of sowing unit that are susceptible to be pollinated by the characterization of each unit of planting using three vegetation index such as: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), GNDVI (Green NDVI) y RVI (Red Vegetation Index).","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975991","Oil Palm;Fuzzy ARTMAP (Adaptive resonance temporary map);Indices de Vegetación;Polinización asistida;Unmanned aerial vehicles (UA V's)","Indexes;Vegetation mapping;Oils;Image segmentation;Monitoring;Silicon compounds;Irrigation","","1","","28","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is focused on determining the number of nodes, which collectively are able to yield an adequate network performance. We implemented function optimization methods and QoS metric analysis to find the effective number of sensors. It is guaranteed that the network is competent and meets the requirements of volcano monitoring systems. The process was arranged in three phases: Network WSN on the ns-2 simulator was implemented with randomized distribution. The transmission of information was collected for 2 minutes of simulation, showing tolerable results of average delay in units of milliseconds. The second stage corresponds to the deduction of the algebraic objective function, and the last includes the application of nonlinear optimization methods on objective function. The results show that the optimal number of nodes is 10, it ensures packet loss less than 20%.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7975996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975996","WSN;Volcano Monitoring;QoS metrics","Wireless sensor networks;Monitoring;Quality of service;Volcanoes;Optimization methods;Measurement;Linear programming","","","","20","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reasons may be related to the decline in fertility rates, increased life expectancy, improved healthcare and the incorporation of healthier living habits, providing conditions for active aging. Active aging is a theme addressed by professionals who more directly that are related to the aging process. In this context, it is important to analyze and promote actions with the elderly population for this can be an integral and active part of the digital society, because increasingly the exercise of civic rights and duties to be carried out through digital platforms. At present, the digital society implies that all citizens are equipped with digital skills, in this particular case, given that the elderly population is referred to as computer exclusion population, it is urgent to create conditions to promote their digital inclusion that will enable them to true social inclusion thus providing active aging. Given the physiological and cognitive decline associated with aging is important to promote initiatives to prevent situations that could increase dementia among the elderly. In particular, there are already a number of digital applications (APPs) that aim to stimulation and cognitive training. In this research, we were used APPs in this area (Peak and Neuronation) which involved a sample of 18 seniors who attended USALBI (Universidade Sénior Albicastrense). This Project Workseeks to ascertain whether the use of digital applications (APPs) Peak & Neuronation can contribute to active aging of the elderly, with regard to cognitive training that they provide. In addition to the 18 elderlies, as students of computer course USALBI, where it made a non-participant observation in 12 practice sessions of APPs Peak & Neuronation and applied questionnaire surveys and these old, was also involved one professional of Social Gerontology and an expert in the field of ICT through semi-structured interviews to ascertain their views concerning digital applications involved in the study.

A prominent contribution of the research is related to an algorithm that generates questionnaires from those texts. This article presents and discusses the main strategy that subsidizes the concerns involved in the development of such algorithm. The strategy will have several stages and the first step of the algorithm will be to interact with the researcher, who should inform the text and the purpose of his research through Keywords. The second step of the algorithm will be to insert this text into a computational medium (if it has not yet been inserted) and from the items of the bibliographic reference it will look for the referenced and related articles in available journals or repositories, in order to create a base of Data that will be called a Bibliographic Corpus which, in turn, will support it. In the creation of Corpus will be generated the morphological and semantic meanings of all words in the text and referenced articles. The next step of the algorithm will be to create relationships between the types of words in the text and the content of the Corpus, taking into account the characteristics of each word. In the stage of semantic relationships of the prayers of the text with the Corpus it will be necessary to separate text and Corpus in sentences, sentences and phrases. From the morphological and semantic meanings of the words of the text will be established the relationships with the adverbs of mode and demonstrative pronouns, which will allow the creation of questions. Finally the last step of the algorithm will be to reconstruct prayers or sentences, adding What, When, Why, Where, Who, How, and How much. The result of applying these steps will be an algorithm for generating questionnaires, in the form of an inquiry, about a particular academic text, and a good reason for holding reading for clarification, or not.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7976003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976003","Text;Corpus;Questions;Adverbs","Software;Semantics;Bills of materials;Algorithm design and analysis","","","","12","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study of Global Cities emerged as a key concept to identify and characterize cities as main agents in the performance of the world economy, i.e., World Cities (WC). There is consensus on how to identify market leader cities worldwide. Nevertheless, the classification criteria has been proven a difficult task. Similarly, there is criticism on the results obtained with these studies, especially due to the scarcity of data, compromising many published results. Missing data along consequent years justifies the lack of scientific publications about the evolution of World City Networks. Recent researches are also associated to ""lack of data"". This paper identifies these problems as the ""7 deadly sins"" of World Cities, and examines how these deficiencies may be corrected using a unique air traffic dataset, the POAT (Public Online Air Traffic) data.

The accessibility assessment was carried out to verify compliance with the WCAG 1.0 published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The main goal of this study is to determine if even people with disabilities can access and use websites of the universities with higher academic prestige. From the results, we can conclude that the majority of the tested websites do not achieve an acceptable level of compliance. Universities with high academic prestige do not show a greater level of web accessibility. By performing the evaluation of university websites, we have identified that there are major barriers to a large number of users. We identified and discussed the most violated WCAG. Our findings may raise awareness to the web developer about these violations and encourage them on how to build better and accessible websites.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7976007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976007","Accessibility;universities;Turkey","Guidelines;W3C;Web pages;Usability;Visualization","","7","","26","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of information from ""wearable"" devices in the area of ""fitness"" is a common practice, however, in the context of health and clinical decision making it is not usual to use the information obtained through by such devices. Doubts as to their reliability and accuracy, as well as the lack of scientific information and validation of the algorithms associated with the devices, make it difficult to use them in the health area. Thus, a set of questions is posed: how reliable and accurate is the data obtained from the biometric sensors of those devices? Can any of them be used in a health context? To attempt to answer these questions, a comparative analysis was performed between the data of the sensor using photoplethysmography (intended to evaluate heart rate) provided by one of these devices (Microsoft Band2) and a duly certified clinical device (ECG), whose heart rate assessment is made through the electrical activity of the heart. The results obtained allow us to state that, under certain conditions, the wearable device, in relation to the evaluation of the RR interval and cardiac frequency, provides valid information for use in clinical practice. The next steps will be taken in order to validate other types of sensors provided by that these devices.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7976034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976034","Wearable;Mobile;Photoplethtysmograph;RR interval;Heart Rate;Usability","Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Reliability;Mobile communication;Hospitals","","6","","16","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper approaches three predominant realities within the class of results of information systems planning, namely the vision, the goals and the policies. This approach focuses on how these three elements are articulated, on identifying the level where information systems security policies (policies under study in this work and not the organization's general policies) stand within the management of information systems, and also on identifying the way these three realities are expressed.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7976036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976036","predominant realities;information systems planning;vision;goals;security policies","Information systems;Planning;Organizations;Bills of materials;Security;Face;Instruments","","","","31","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, in the case of waiting queues, the most relevant aspect is the combination of the number of multitasking servers assigned to attend and the demand that varies over the course of a day's work. The main objective is to meet the expectations created by the client regarding the opinion of the service that was provided. The contribution that this work proposes to give consists in planning the number of servers adapted to a given demand, not forgetting the valuation associated with the release of resources to perform other tasks related to the business. We use linear programming to determine the optimal number of the servers to serve customers, depending on their hourly availability to fulfill this function and the estimated demand. The model is submitted to four distinct real scenarios, each one reflecting a certain service reality, so that we can evaluate its behavior and possible gains against real situations occurring under the same conditions. The results show the credibility of the model since it reveals in conditions very similar to those of a real situation (translated in one of the scenarios), very little relevant differences.","","978-9-8998-4347-9","10.23919/CISTI.2017.7976055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976055","linear programming;scheduling;queue","Linear programming;Servers;Nanoelectromechanical systems;Face;Europe;Companies;Multitasking","","","","8","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern diffraction techniques can normally obtain the cell parameters of zeolites, but they are not capable of solving the location of their atoms, especially for complex zeolites. Here, we propose a novel approach for determining the zeolite structure based on Genetic Algorithms of artificial intelligence area. This proposal takes into account the specific features of the problem domain for designing a suitable fitness function. Moreover, unlike typical genetic algorithm applications, our approach also includes these specific features of the problem when generating the initial generation and when applying the crossover operator, with relevant results.
