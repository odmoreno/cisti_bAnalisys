Three scenarios with different vehicle configurations on the road were considered. The open source tool, Millicar, was used for the simulations. This tool is basically a module integrated to ns3 and is configured according to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards defined for vehicular communications in 5G New Radio (5G-NR). In addition, it is optimized for the use of millimeter bands where there is a special interest due to the availability of spectrum in these bands. However, there are certain challenges to be taken into account, related to the high attenuation that occurs at these frequencies. The results obtained show the direct impact of increased vehicle speed on the performance achieved. In addition, a higher vehicle separation results in a higher rate of lost packets, thus reducing the throughput. Finally, the performance of V2X communication in millimeter bands is improved due to the use of higher bandwidths.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211664","C-V2X;mmWave;5G;vehicular communications","Space vehicles;Roads;Bandwidth;Attenuation;Throughput;New Radio;High frequency","","","","11","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Portugal, the educational systems determine some rules to promote an educational process that leads students to attain specific skills, abilities, and attitudes according to the student profile at the end of compulsory education. Study or training visits are didactic tools that contribute to the link between theoretical content and practice, adding value to the teaching and learning process. In this sense, virtual study visits (VSVs) using digital technologies are a way to promote connections between knowledge and know-how since they have a low cost, require less bureaucratic processes, and allow teachers to make use of this resource within the timetable of the curricular units. VSVs can be used in all curricular units, adding value to the contents covered. This study rooted in the Design Science Research methodology, proposes the construction of an artefact that can contribute to the training processes within teaching. It is based on an innovation idea awarded in 2021 and consists of creating a web portal to promote virtual visits, which may be used as an environment for the promotion of virtual field trips customised according to the curricular units and the level of the classes. It is expected that the web portal can contribute to the sustainable development of the regions, as it will use local tour guides who will receive all the training to prepare multimedia material and deal with each level of education.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211569","digital technologies;virtual study visits;design science research;education;innovation","Training;Technological innovation;Costs;Design methodology;Position measurement;Sustainable development;Portals","","","","9","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper intends to assess the developments and solutions found for online scheduling problems. Online scheduling is a very important topic since most of the real scheduling problems have dynamic characteristics. First, it was developed a literature review about scheduling problems, dividing them in stochastic and deterministic problems as well as in online and offline problems. Then, a bibliometric analysis was performed. Finally, some case studies in the field of online scheduling were analyzed. Online Scheduling is mostly explored in industry and health areas. In some articles explored there is a rescheduling, and the sequence of task may change due to the arrival of new tasks. In other cases, the new tasks are introduced in blocks of time that do not affect the previous schedule. This last technique is limited, since, with the arrival of new tasks, the schedule is not re-evaluated. Therefore, it is thought that, in future work, within the scope of online scheduling, when new tasks or other significant changes enter the system, the system should be evaluated, allowing the necessary changes to be made to the existing schedule. The Industry 4.0 and the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning and Machine Learning favours a continuous and real-time flow of information, which allows the implementation of real-time online scheduling. This is a branch that should be explored in future works.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211826","online scheduling;heuristics;internet of things;machine learning","Industries;Deep learning;Schedules;Job shop scheduling;Bibliometrics;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems","","","","26","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In applications involving many instances and/or instances with high dimensionality, the search process is time-consuming due to the need to perform many calculations of similarity functions between instances. Several proposals to reduce the k-NN search time have been made, some of them aiming at the exact search of the k most similar instances to x in T and, others, reducing the search time via approximate methods to calculate the most similar instances to x. This work proposes an algorithm called $\mathrm{kM}++\mathrm{kNN}$ for the exact search of the k most similar instances to x in T, which uses the triangular inequality concept to reduce the ${\mathrm {k-N N}}$ search time. The ${\mathrm {k M++k N N}}$ algorithm is compared, in experiments to measure the economy of the number of calculations of similarity functions between instances and search time, with an algorithm currently considered fast, the kMkNN.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211848","k-NN;kMkNN;k-nearest neighbors;exact search;fast search;triangle inequality","Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Approximation algorithms;Time measurement;Classification algorithms;Velocity measurement;Proposals","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite efforts by the World Health organization (WHO) to reduce the incidence of TB, it is estimated that in 2020 about 10 million people became ill with the disease and 1.3 million deaths were recorded worldwide as a result of the disease. In Brazil, one person contracts TB every five minutes and one person per hour dies from TB. In 2020 alone, there was an increase of 12% in the number of deaths recorded compared to 2019. Monitoring the possible outcomes of a patient with TB is an important task that can help reduce the early mortality of a patient diagnosed with this disease. However, determining this outcome is not a trivial task, especially in terms of anticipating the patient’s prognosis. Brazil has the and Notifiable Diseases Information System (in Portuguese, SINAN), which contains a database with the records of patients with notifiable diseases, including TB. Classifying the treatment outcomes of tuberculosis into either CURED and DIED (prognosis) using a machine learning (ML) model can assist healthcare professionals in deciding on the most appropriate treatment given the individual patient’s conditions and likely course of disease based on medical experience. In this article, we propose the use of ML to determine the prognosis of tuberculosis using support vector machines and gradient boosting from literature. We also feature selection techniques and random search techniques to find the hyperparameter optimization. Using a rigorous scientific methodology, experiments were carried out with different scenarios that balanced and imbalanced the data set and appropriate metrics were used to evaluate the models. Then, the model with the best performance was selected.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211510","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas; Universidade de Pernambuco; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211510","Tuberculosis;Machine Learning;Prognosis;Classification;Model","Support vector machines;Analytical models;Sensitivity;Tuberculosis;Predictive models;Data models;Security","","","","24","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article deals with the results of a study framed in the characterization of the media competence with which teenagers interact with the media and information on Internet, as well as their behavior in the face of false contents that are massively disseminated. For this purpose, a questionnaire composed of 33 questions was applied to a sample of 727 teenagers between 15 and 18 years of age, and belonging to the high school level in three provinces of Ecuador: Carchi, Imbabura and Loja.Among the results, it is evident that teenagers have a high instrumental mastery of ICTs, which they choose mainly for the security it provides them; however, there are gaps regarding the critical use of information for both consumption and content creation. In this regard, less than 40% feel interested in verifying information prior to its dissemination; and, although they recognize that information from social networks is not very credible, they point to this as the main space for information, above traditional media such as television. The results of the study are key to amplify the importance of media literacy in the classroom, while serving as a basis for future study designs on the subject.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211591","media literacy;fake news;disinformation;media competence;social networks;teenagers","TV;Social networking (online);Instruments;Education;Personal digital devices;Media;Internet","","","","31","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study deals with the process of estimating a working memory score based on the Neupsilin neuropsychological test and the analysis of electroencephalographic signals collected while the user performs an n-back task. The study was applied to 14 volunteers, divided into two groups, one with aphasia and the other one without aphasia. As expected, the analysis of the n-back task showed a lower performance in aphasic individuals. The results also indicate that the Neupsilin test can be used to separate the two classes of individuals, with an average accuracy of 78.57 %, using three subtests related to the working memory. The scores can be used to build a statistical model to estimate the working memory usage based on the collected electroencephalographic signals.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211466","aphasia;working memory;electroencephalography","Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last two decades, cross-linguistic studies have used eye-tracking techniques to investigate language comprehension and production. The literature already records the use of these techniques in several populations with comprehension and communication disorders, including aphasia. However, studies of this type are scarce in Portuguese language. This research approaches the use of eye tracking technique to investigate sentence comprehension in aphasic patients, resulting from brain lesion. To this end, a computational tool was developed, based on the Tobii PCEye Mini device. The goal is to help speech therapists in the evaluation of auditory comprehension in Brazilians individuals with aphasia. The data were collected in an experiment with eight volunteers with and without aphasia, equally divided into an experimental and a control groups, respectively. The results show that the selected tasks imposed greater cognitive demands on aphasics than on control group members, and this was identified by eye tracking. This technique, combined with the comprehension test of clinical use (TROG-2), results in an adequate solution to evaluate the comprehension of the aphasic individual in Portuguese and thus establish a more assertive rehabilitation program.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211448","Aphasia;Eye Movements;Eye-Tracking;Sentence Comprehension","Sociology;Gaze tracking;Production;Lesions;Task analysis;Statistics;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The infrastructure of the VoD system providers needs to keep up with the increasing number of its user base and therefore it is important to find scalable and smart solutions that can adapt while maintaining a satisfactory performance. Basing VoD systems on peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies could distribute the burden of a network while optimizing, or at least maintaining, the performance during video playbacks. Content replicated and distributed by active users avoids the need for a huge number of dedicated servers. The usage of P2P for VoD also inherits some policies such as peer selection policy or piece selection policy that could be leveraged in a collaborative manner by entities such as Internet System Providers (ISP). ISPs usually try to safeguard networks with traffic shaping or load balancing. Bringing a collaborative interface could allow the ISPs to inform third party applications of certain overlay networks that should be respected, allowing the protection of some links or nodes from certain traffic. Achieving symbiosis between a P2P VoD service and ISPs may bring new opportunities to improve end user experience while guaranteeing the ISP best interests. In this context, this project aims to develop a P2P VoD prototype that allows to study the effectiveness of commonly used peer, piece, and replicas management/selection strategies, as well as the ability to implement new strategies.

This systematic mapping study compiles the results of studies that report the development of MSA based systems applied to animal production. For this, a systematic search was carried out in 7 academic databases, obtaining 1362 initial results, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria for the study. It was observed that the industry with the largest number of developed systems is Aquaculture reported in 11 studies, then Cattle Farming reported in 9 studies, followed by solutions for livestock in general (including poultry) in 4 studies. Regarding contexts of application, the use of animal health monitoring systems was reported in 6 studies, followed by production monitoring systems in 5 studies and a third place shared between product quality monitoring systems, and systems for monitoring environmental conditions, reported in 4 studies each.

These standards describe semantics that should be implemented by the machines that claim to follow them. However, these semantics are defined in textual format in the standard, which makes it challenging to verify the compliance of a standard-compliant machine description against the semantics defined in the standard. This hinders the interoperability between machines from different vendors. However, in the context of Industry 4.0, it is crucial to enable interoperability between machines and, thus, an open ecosystem to ensure industrial automation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to extract and formalize the semantics from the industry standards to facilitate the compliance verification of machine descriptions against industry standards. Currently, no comprehensive method is described in the state-of-the-art to address this issue. In this thesis, we investigate how to solve the problem of (semi-)automatically extracting and formalizing semantics from the industrial standard technical specifications using Semantic Web Technologies (SWT), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) and knowledge-based information extraction methods. Mainly we focus on (i) Named Entity Recognition on the text of the technical documents; (ii) binary and multi-class rule (constraint) classification on limited annotated specific textual data; (iii) information extraction from tables, and (iv) finding the contextual similarity between the information from the text and the tables of the same document. We use OPC UA Companion Specifications as the first use case.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211635","Information Extraction;Natural Language Processing;Semantic Web;OPC UA","Industries;Text recognition;Semantics;Ecosystems;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Data mining","","","","19","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since its inception both academia and industry debate the different shades that agile processes and technical practices play in the day-to-day of students and professional developers. Efforts have been made to understand the pros and cons of the Test Driven Development (TDD) practice to develop software as part of a professional environment. Despite the effort of practitioners to list the TDD anti-patterns that unveil undesired effects in the code when practicing TDD, work is needed to understand the causes that lead to that. In that sense, this paper proposes a research project that explores the TDD anti-patterns context and what leads practitioners to face them in the software development context. As a result, we expect to offer a TDD maturity framework to help practitioners in the process of writing code guided by tests and prevent the addition of anti-patterns.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211890","TDD;anti-patterns;agile;practitioners;software development","Industries;Codes;Source coding;Design methodology;Writing;Software;Faces","","","","37","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To build data warehouses in Business Intelligence it is employed the dimensional model. One of its goals is to facilitate the interactive exploration of data. The adaptation of the dimensional model to NoSQL databases is relevant given its proliferation and the data navigation advantages that the dimensional model provides. It is therefore urgent to make more studies that allow assessing this feasibility. In this work, a dimensional model is extrapolated to a model in a document data warehouse. The rising questions are: (i) using document databases what is the feasibility of models that simulate the dimensional model; (ii) what the specificities in data preparation phase are; (iii) what the degree of simplicity in writing queries for data analysis is and (iv) what about its performance. In this context, the same set of analysis questions are applied to two systems: one called ROLAP (relational) and the other DOLAP (document). The results achieved reveal that data analysis queries for document warehouses are not complex, although with different execution times. On the other hand, depending on the adoption of the type of dimensional model, there are different efforts in the data preparation phase.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211731","Business Intelligence;Document Data Warehouses;NoSQL-OLAP","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Text analysis;Navigation;NoSQL databases;Relational databases;Data warehouses","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The theoretical approach was in the context of Information Systems (ISs). The cases of one gym in Portugal and one in Brazil were studied through a qualitative methodology using the holistic multiple case study method. Data collection was made through a content analysis and interviews with managers of both gyms. The results allow the conclusion that the global and sudden pandemic confinement COVID-19 affected management control decisions in gym services, especially the budget control which showed abnormally unfavorable deviations in income, expenses and investments. Although the studied gyms were located in different continents (Portugal and Brazil), the managers’ control decisions were similar, evidencing an immediate damage containment response and short-term resilience. As for the ISs, the results showed that the instrumental usefulness of these systems implemented in both gyms was never questioned as a support to operation and decision making. But the temporary and drastic reduction in the activity of the gyms, in response to an unexpected confinement context, meant a consequent and natural reduction in their use. As for the extent of the theoretical framework, the study reinforces the weaknesses of the budgeting process in an unexpected pandemic context, on the one hand, and the interdependence between ISs and management control decisions in the gym services sector. Additionally, without questioning that interdependence relationship, it can also be interpreted that ISs have an instrumental character because they are more dependent on managers’ decisions and critical junctures.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211814","Management accounting;gym services;Information Systems (ISs);pandemic confinement COVID-19;Portugal;Brazil;case study.","COVID-19;Pandemics;Instruments;Decision making;Process control;Data collection;Interviews","","","","26","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The index volume increased after the rise of remote work in the COVID-19 pandemic, developing a global competition for talent. The turnover was even higher in small companies far from metropolitan regions, such as XYZW (fictitious name), a company based in a Brazilian countryside city, which reached 23.07% in the index in this period. Thus, this study seeks to verify the possible impact of the rise of remote work due to the pandemic on the turnover rates of the company X Y Z W and develop an action plan for reducing this turnover. To this end, a study with two cycles of action research was conducted to identify this influence and propose interventions. The findings point out the influence of remote work on the turnover of professionals at XYZW company and up to 382% difference between her salaries and those of the market, in addition to various legal risks, promoting the immediate adherence of the action plan focused on the valorization of the IT sectors of the company. This study confirmed the influence of remote work on the turnover of the company XYZW and the gap that a small IT company outside large urban centers like it can have for the market, generating low competitiveness in the face of remote work and increasing the risks of voluntary turnover.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211853","turnover;IT;remote work;home office;Industry-Academia Collaboration;Action Research","COVID-19;Pandemics;Law;Urban areas;Companies;Remote working;Indexes","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work we propose two improvements to obtain optimal liver segmentation: contrast enhancement using a guided crossmodality technique as a preprocessing prior to liver segmentation; as well as the GPU paralysis of the Chan-Vese method. The results present a notable improvement in the sensitivity and precision of liver segmentation, as well as a much faster calculation, desirable to obtain liver segmentation in real-time during the surgery.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211649","segmentation;medical imaging;high performance computing;GPU","Image segmentation;Sensitivity;Computed tomography;Partial differential equations;Liver;Surgery;Robustness","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project here described focuses on the type of events and approaches related with the vehicle drivers and the identification of both their performance profiles and health condition while in operation. For that purpose, existing nonintrusive technologies present on the vehicle are leveraged, able to collect data related to physiological measurements taken in realtime. Such sensitive data will be processed, stored and shared in a secure manner, using blockchain-based technologies, so that only authenticated and authorized parties will be able to access the data, according to their clearance level, through an Application Programming Interface (API) designed for that purpose. The architecture of the system will be microservices-based, with components deployed at different infrastructure levels—from On Board Units (OBUs) in vehicles up to cloud-based subsystems.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211847","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211847","Blockchain;Public Transportation;Security;Reliability;Performance Profile;Microservices","Urban areas;Medical services;Real-time systems;Reliability;Biomedical monitoring;Virtualization;Sustainable development","","","","13","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are capable of providing long-range coverage for umMTC devices with low-power consumption at a low cost. For example, LoRaWAN technology is known for delivering large coverage areas between 1 and 10$\sim$kms, and more than 5 years of battery lifetime, making it an exceptional candidate technology to support the IoE paradigm. However, LoRaWAN comes with its drawbacks, including scalability, operational latency, and security issues. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel holistic edge-based LoRaWAN encryption system, in which, part of the computation and authentication is moved to the gateway, i.e., the edge. The rest of the computation occurs in the cloud, at the application server, thus reducing operational latency. Edge-based applications typically demand low latency, real-time, and intelligent computing applications, just to name a few. The suggested approach overcomes the inevitable drawbacks of the classic cloud-based LoRaWAN architectures, as well as enhances important 5G services such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and umMTC. Given these early but encouraging results, we examine the system challenges linked to latency to demonstrate how the proposed solution could be implemented with minor modifications to existing protocols and technologies.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10212054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212054","LoRaWAN;IoT;Edge Computing;Encryption","Wireless communication;Cloud computing;Protocols;Scalability;Massive machine type communications;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Real-time systems","","","","42","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People search for beautiful spaces leading them to hike on mountain trails. Hiking in the mountain is recommended for everyone since it has benefits for wellness and health. However, hiking on trails can be dangerous and can even lead to accidents. The number of accidents in the mountains has been increasing, as well as the number of medical emergencies associated with this type of environment. Madeira Island has several trails and recently a significant number of tourists are coming to the island for hiking the trails. Emergency teams need to help people in danger. Multiple challenges have been identified and the following aims established: helping emergency teams during the search for hikers on the mountains; identifying the crowding of hikers on trails; recognizing hikers who are in danger; supplying advice about dangerous situations and making hikers remain safe on trails. To tackle those challenges, a methodology was proposed aiming at understanding how hikers perceive their safety on the trails and developing tools for monitoring and locating hikers on the trails on Madeira Island. Through the use of cameras and an AI algorithm, it will be possible to identify and count people. With the methodology proposed it is expected: searches for people on trails become faster and more efficient; manage trail visitors to make trails safe and even more appealing; have a tool for localizing hikers on the trails; and ultimately, make Madeira Island trails safer.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211377","mountain;trails;hiking;safety;hikers monitoring.","Legged locomotion;Cameras;Safety;Security;Cultural differences;Artificial intelligence;Monitoring","","","","29","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These factors might reduce their adoption among agile practitioners. To address this problem, we propose a framework for reviewing non-functional requirements in the agile requirements formulated as user stories. Our proposed framework utilizes a combination of natural language processing and artificial intelligence techniques to automate analyzing and predicting non-functional requirements in user stories. Then, the artifacts needed for the requirements reading and reviewing technique are generated to assist requirements inspectors in reviewing non-functional requirements, identifying possible defects, and consequentially making a reasonably informed review decision.

As it is a relatively new technology, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate which tools are already more consolidated with the use of Grid Computing. The paper describes, through literature review, the most mentioned tools, frameworks, and platforms for Grid Computing in the analyzed articles.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211778","Grid Computing;Tools;Frameworks;Platforms;Literature Review;High-Performance Computing;Distributed and Heterogeneous Systems","Costs;High performance computing;Bibliographies;Grid computing;Supercomputers;Task analysis;Investment","","","","21","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our specific context, previous work used a CPD algorithm to detect and quantify change in spatiotemporal datasets composed of moving and shape-changing objects represented by a sequence of time stamped 2D polygon boundaries. Though the results were promising, we question if the selection of a particular PSR algorithm influences the results of detection and quantification of change. In this work we review and compare several PSR algorithms, characterize test datasets and used metrics, and perform tests for the selected datasets.

Traditional inspection by human experts is expensive, time-consuming, and subjective to human errors. Consequently, automatic leather inspection has become an essential part of any production system as it rejects nonconformities, ensures product quality, reduces operating costs, and shortens production cycle times. This paper presents an artificial intelligent model using computer vision for the autonomous inspection of natural leather. Due to its good results in similar problems, the YOLO algorithm was chosen. More specifically, a comparison of the Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large models of YOLOv5 in leather defect detection was performed.

The proposed method separates model training, model deployment, and model usage stages, allowing increased privacy. To demonstrate the possibility to apply the proposed method in practise, we developed a prototype that employs smart contracts, local blockchain Oracles, and distributed application that allows user to interact with blockchain network via graphical user interface. The prototype system was deployed into the Hyperledger Fabric environment and experimentally tested combining multiple machine learning models into a Shapley-weighted ensemble. We have shown that our method can be implemented using existing blockchain technologies and can be used to deploy data and machine learning models.

The second was a data standardization plan from the authority. The last was a distributed peer-to-peer platform for organisations to share data when authorized by farmers.

Finally, a series of experiments were carried out on natural leather samples from MVTec AD to confirm our findings. The outcomes highlight our discoveries and provide a framework for determining the fine-tuning parameters of U-Net.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211983","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211983","computer vision;semantic segmentation;U-Net;MVTec","Knowledge engineering;Computer vision;Semantic segmentation;Computer architecture;Quality control;Real-time systems;Reliability","","","","14","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A practical example is the analysis on the distribution of the Emergency Aid in Brazil, approved by the National Congress in 2020, due to the pandemic of the new coronavirus. However, as will be seen throughout the text, there are challenges to processing massive databases. Tools capable of processing a large volume of data in a short period of time are increasingly needed. Apache Hadoop is an important framework that allows distributed processing of massive databases, reducing query times. To elucidate this issue, this paper presents a comparison between two file extensions (.txt and.ORC) and checks their performance in processing Hive queries on the Emergency Relief database. The results showed significant differences in average execution time when adopting the.ORC file format. On the other hand, what was thought to be discrepant, the average value of the aid, was not proven, since all States received similar values.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211724","Massive Database;Hadoop;Hive;Emergency Aid;open data","Economics;COVID-19;Distributed processing;Pandemics;Distributed databases;Cluster computing;Big Data","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, for some situations the legislation is silent and it is up to the judiciary to decide according to the specific case, thus making this matter even more complex and difficult to elucidate. The reasons for wanting to formalize the Law of Succession with the help of formal language and the creation of systems capable of inferring assumptions in situations with a high load of rules and restrictions are countless. Formalization improves the exact and specific understanding of a text because it helps highlight ambiguities, unintended readings or interpretations, increases accurate understanding and avoids misinterpretation of legal text arising from frequent amendments and revisions of legislation and jurisprudence. This results in an expansion of access to information, productivity growth, information qualification, better control of deadlines, increased efficiency and cost reduction. This work explores, therefore, a formalization of knowledge and legal reasoning of Succession Law through an approach known as Fluents Calculus, highlighting possibilities and limits in the automation of tasks in the area.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211651","fluent calculus;knowledge representation;right of succession;legal automation","Productivity;Automation;Law;Decision making;Legislation;Formal languages;Calculus","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, versatile production concepts with modular structures promise a better adaptation to these dynamic boundary conditions in terms of quantity production, product variety, and manufacturing location. Modular construction has significant advantages over traditional on-site construction in terms of material efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Therefore, specialized software for building design is one of the critical aspects of modular construction. This work presents the development of an online platform for the design of buildings using modular construction. The main features of this platform are the 2D home design with 3D visualization, using BIM approaches, the validation of architectural rules and system limits taking into consideration the design and legal framework, and the management of orders and workflows for sustainable construction. The validation of architecture rules and system limits allows the use of the platform by final clients to design their houses and obtain the budget and the construction viability based on modular construction.

Using a predictive model to differentiate healthy eyes from others with different type of lesions can be useful to save time, help diagnose atypical cases and assist specialists with less experience. In this work, we investigate the application of a deep learning model to perform multi-class image classification of eye fundus images. A pretrained residual neural network is fine tuned on a dataset of samples collected at the Hospital de Cl\’inicas and Hospital General Pediátrico Acosta Nu medical centers from Asunci\’on, Paraguay.

In this article we present an algorithm that improves the details of medical images, preserves the average brightness, preserves the structural similarity and corrects the problem of poor contrast. This algorithm improves medical images using the top-hat transform by reconstruction, which extracts brightness and darkness features on multiple scales. These features are used to enhance the medical image. The algorithm was tested with medical images from two public databases. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves contrast, introduces little noise, preserves natural brightness, detail and similarity to the original medical image.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211680","Medica1 images;poor contrast;average brightness;structural similarity;top-hat transform by reconstruction","Measurement;Visualization;Brightness;Transforms;Feature extraction;Proposals;Task analysis","","","","26","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We provide a freely accessible webpage, where the user can insert the number of nodes, specify whether it is a directed or undirected graph, and the range of the distribution, to observe the influence of each parameter. We consider several goals: we offer the procedure computation, based on the well-known Dijkstra’s algorithm; we combine the PHP language with a numerical language (Fortran), with the gnuplot graphing utility; and we stress the suggestion of the Internet as a computing medium. The simulation runs on the webpage, thus needing no software installation or special power or matching operating system. This Web application is an example for many other problems, and is implemented on a Linux platform. The study draws attention both to the use of the Web for scientific computing, and to the convenience of this use in scientific publications.

Providing appropriate techniques to monitor the efficient and safe operation of their underlying Operational Technology (aka. OTM) is naturally of paramount importance. One crucial challenge is, however, that a CI’s OT is continuously evolving on a high pace, leading to massive heterogeneities, interdependencies and interoperability problems, thereby making OTM and integrative service quality hard to achieve. The research goal of our project »DevCon« is therefore to push forward appropriate techniques to facilitate OTM and integrative service quality even in face of the evolving nature inherent in this kind of systems. In particular, to overcome heterogeneities while explicating interdependencies and ensuring interoperability, conceptualizations of OT objects and service quality are put forward, providing the basis for a pivotal knowledge base. For this, an innovative approach is followed by synergistically combining inductive methods in terms of machine learning and deductive methods in terms of semantic technologies.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211349","ASEAN-European Academic University Network; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211349","Critical Infrastructure (CI);Operational Technology Monitoring (OTM);Machine Learning;Semantic Technologies","Renewable energy sources;Knowledge based systems;Transportation;Machine learning;Pressing;Critical infrastructure;Monitoring","","","","25","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While OERs provide free and unlimited access to high-quality learning resources, their scattered nature presents significant challenges in finding relevant and high-quality materials. Furthermore, the lack of a centralized repository for OERs makes it difficult to ensure the accuracy and quality of the materials being queried. To address these issues, the paper presents the ENCORE methodology that provides software components, or ENCORE enablers, to enable educators to include relevant OERs that target specific skills in their learning paths. The methodology also leverages notebook interfaces and gamification mechanisms to promote students’ learning engagement. The paper illustrates the ENCORE methodology through a case study, where the methodology is applied to an OER repository of educational resources developed by the expert network on model-driven engineering (MDEnet). The case study demonstrates that designing the database and enablers as independent but holistic components enables the use of OERs to accomplish a wider range of educational goals, such as supporting the creation of learning paths. The paper concludes with indications on how to extend the ENCORE methodology to further enhance the creation and delivery of personalized learning experiences, supporting the reuse of open educational resources and the automatic generation of personalized learning paths.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211772","Erasmus; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211772","open educational resource;web scraping;model-driven engineering;learning paths","Learning management systems;Databases;Scalability;Open Educational Resources;Model driven engineering;Software;Planning","","1","","28","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, this work aims to address recent studies on the use of m-health in the clinical practice of oncological diseases and report the characteristics of the apps involved. For this, a review of m-health focused on oncology was conducted using the PubMed and Science Direct databases. The investigation was carried out using tools inherent in international databases and was limited to articles published between 2015 and 2022. In total, 34 articles were analyzed, with a higher frequency of publications between 2019 and 2022. The resources observed were patient follow-up, prevention of signs and symptoms, monitoring of treatment and aid in prognosis and diagnosis of patients. It is concluded that a close collaboration among patients, health professionals, and information technology professionals is necessary to optimize symptom recognition and improve patient-professional communication.

Our data corroborates the existence of a bias, unfavourable to SMEs, both in terms of implementation and perception of relevance of Digital Transformation and Data-Driven Management in their operational and strategical routines. Based on the assumption that SMEs will face an increasing competitive pressure in the future, since technology progressively benefits economies of scale, we set on to identify business sectors where those enterprises were already lagging compared to larger ones in respect to several structural business metrics. A comparison with information from other European Countries underlines a generic dire picture of businesses in Portugal, where the value added per unit of capital and labour investment are much lower than those found in most European countries.This works emphasizes the need to facilitate the adoption and use of technology in Portuguese SMEs, as well as building up management literacy that encourages continuous improvement and innovation.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211746","Micro;Small and medium-sized enterprises;Digital Transformation;Data-driven Management;Operational efficiency","Productivity;Surveys;Measurement;Economics;Technological innovation;Oceans;Europe","","","","20","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, most studies dealing with municipal solid wastes in the literature focus on environmental aspects, proposing new routes for recycling, composting and landfilling. However, there are other aspects to be improved in the systems that deal with municipal solid waste, especially in the transportation sector. Scholars have been exploring alternatives to improve the performance in waste collection tasks since the late 50s, for example, considering the waste collection problem as static. The transition from a static approach to a dynamic is necessary to increase the feasibility of the solution, requiring faster algorithms. Here we explore the improvement in the performance of the guided local search metaheuristic available in OR-Tools upon different execution times lower than 10 seconds to solve the capacitated waste collection problem. We show that increasing the execution time from 1 to 10 seconds can overcome savings of up to 1.5 km in the proposed system. Considering application in dynamic scenarios, the 9 s increase in execution time (from 1 to 10 s) would not hinder the algorithm’s feasibility. Additionally, the assessment of the relation between performance in different execution times with the dataset’s tightness revealed a correlation to be explored in more detail in future studies. The work done here is the first step towards a shift of paradigm from static scenarios in waste collection to dynamic route planning, with the execution time established according to the conclusions achieved in this study.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211886","MIT Portugal; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; MIT Portugal; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211886","municipal solid waste management system;route optimization;waste collection;dynamic approach;sustainability.","Waste management;Waste materials;Heuristic algorithms;Metaheuristics;Transportation;Solids;Search problems","","","","31","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In medical services, there is a high percentage of dissatisfaction with medical care due to the processes related to appointment booking and waiting time for medical consultation. As a result, patients change medical services due to the urgency of the symptoms they suffer, generating distrust in health services in Peru. Through a medical information system, events of medical care processes are collected for analysis using the Celonis tool. The process mining discipline uses the discovery of the study process to identify existing bottlenecks in the process and violations that are included when monitoring process events. The proposed model is based on identifying the existing bottlenecks in the processes, which are appointment booking and office care, as these processes take an average of 135 minutes to execute, and this leads to patient dissatisfaction. The model is composed of 4 main phases: 1. Objectives definition and data processing phase; 2. For the validation of the proposal, a test scenario was defined in a Peruvian public health services organization (ESSALUD) in Satipo, Peru. Preliminary results show that the model reduces by 64% the average time corresponding to the medical consultation process and by 98% the appointment booking.

Limited existing metaverse research focuses on the adoption of metaverse technologies, but little research has been conducted to understand the experiences of early adopters and the motivators and inhibitors which affect their adoption and continued use, despite their role in widespread adoption. This research highlights the motivations of early adopters in using metaverse technologies, with a primary focus on the experiences of early adopters in using social metaverse applications. A qualitative, inductive approach was employed for research, given its strengths in exploring unforeseen themes and allowing early adopters to raise issues which matter most to them. Research was conducted in the metaverse application, RecRoom, with semi-structured interviews taking place between avatars (n=8). The results suggested that motivations for adopting and using the metaverse at this stage were overwhelmingly hedonic, with networks, interest and COVID-19 playing a key role in adoption. The affordances of socialisation, immersion and extended ability significantly affected enjoyment, while harassment and privacy attitudes emerged as inhibitors to continued use. Alongside capturing attitudes of early adopters at this juncture of metaverse development, this research provided suggestions for metaverse researchers and developers for the next stage of innovation.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211253","Metaverse;Virtual Reality;Early Adoption;Cyber-harassment","COVID-19;Privacy;Technological innovation;Metaverse;Inhibitors;Affordances;Avatars","","","","29","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the concept of IoT becomes a technological perspective to support the care of elderly people. This article reports the lessons learned in the implementation of an IoT-based technical prototype for monitoring oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate or pulse (BPM), and body temperature of elderly people. The prototype consists of sensors installed in the comfort of the patient’s home, transmitting data to the cloud to be stored and processed. Then, the processed data can be visualized by two end-user applications: a web dashboard displayed on TV that support the decision-making of health providers and a mobile application that issues alert notifications to caregivers of the patient.

The problem with this change is that not all tax systems have evolved with the same intensity, and it is likely that in the economies of many countries, indeterminate and uncontrollable tax evasion and avoidance is taking place up to now. For the collection of information, a survey was used that seeks to determine the level of evolution of the tax systems of Peru and Chile, the sample taken is non-probabilistic and considers companies that have at least the median range in their countries of origin. The research is applied, cross-sectional and descriptive. It is concluded that the advance of electronic businesses in the study area has been registering significant growth, with more than 61% possibilities, which generates higher income that is subject to taxation.

The accounting area was no exception, and currently, information technologies have become an indispensable tool for the profession. One of the emerging technologies in this area is Robotic Process Automation (RPA), it is a technology that allows you to perform routine activities, normally performed by humans, automatically, making organizations more efficient. It has been applied in several areas in accounting processes, mainly in tasks that involve a high volume of information and that are not qualitatively demanding. However, if on the one hand, there were technologies quickly absorbed by professionals, RPA does not seem to be having the same impact. This study measures the acceptance of robotic process automation (RPA) software by accounting professionals. It was based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and 140 individuals who work as certified accountants or accounting technicians participated in the study. Based on the results obtained, it was possible to conclude that, in general, professionals are satisfied with the use of RPA software, and it was possible to verify that the gender, age and opinion of the respondent on whether the use of this type of software could affect the quality of the financial information produced, are factors that do not influence the acceptance of RPA software. On the other hand, training for its use is a factor that influences the acceptance of the software, given that it was possible to confirm a significant increase in all dimensions in relation to respondents who had no training.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211254","Accounting;Robotic Process Automation;Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)","Intelligent automation;Training;Technology acceptance model;Organizations;Particle measurements;Software;Software measurement","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the ways to automate processes, on the other hand, is using models and applications in descriptive logic, which has been conveniently used in Semantic Web applications because it is a decidable logic and with a higher level of expressiveness than classical propositional logic. On the other hand, Fuzzy Logic has been used since the last century in situations where knowledge needs to be understood in degrees of pertinence, given the present inaccuracies.

One of the actions that citizens can carry out in their daily lives to actively contribute to this problem is by contributing to the recycling of their household waste. However, there is still much to be done to make this useful contribution available to everyone, and one of the main aspects is the frequent and correct delivery of waste at the collection points that exist in cities.

Detecting insiders is challenging because they are difficult to detect and identify, so advanced techniques are required to prevent their activities. This paper discusses an approach that uses a Siamese neural network to authenticate users by transforming their biometric typing data or behavioral characteristics into images. To achieve this goal, the paper considers several methods for transforming numerical (tabular) keystroke data into images. The transformed keystroke data is then used to train Siamese neural networks for image similarity detection to distinguish a real user from a possible insider. The experiments conducted in this study show that transforming time series data into images is a robust and effective approach to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection and user authentication. This paper highlights the importance of comparing different methods for transforming numerical keystroke data into images to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection and user authentication.

With the recognition of the importance of documentary memory, the opportunity arises for a new approach to this type of resource. Lean originated in the manufacturing industry, aiming to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. Ever since, lean tools have been increasingly used in several fields, namely in the office environment, giving rise to the so-called lean office. Their principles can be applied to any type of office, from administrative and support functions to product development and customer service. On the other hand, digitalization can be a key enabler of lean office principles since it can help to automate and streamline processes, reduce errors and waste, and improve the flow of information. For instance, in associations with several members, digitalization can provide improved member engagement, enhanced event management, increased efficiency, and also a greater reach with members. Herein, the Former Students Association of the Industrial and Commercial School of Braga members’ information was gathered and organized into a digital file. The increase in the number of members over the last few years led to the need of digitizing their data, in order to improve the alumni association management.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211411","Lean office;members;digitalization;management;documentation","Manufacturing industries;Customer services;Organizations;Documentation;Product development;Task analysis;Information systems","","","","18","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The benefits and obstacles of these technologies in transitioning procurement into a more strategic role are analyzed. By examining existing literature, critical factors for organizations to consider when implementing these technologies and the potential benefits are identified. The results indicate that digitalization has resulted in a data-driven approach to procurement, with the aid of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence for decision-making. Industry 4.0 has facilitated smarter factories, warehouses, and logistics operations with a focus on automation, connectivity, and real-time data. Procurement can more efficiently manage suppliers, track contracts, and identify cost-saving opportunities with the aid of information systems. This study’s main purpose is to review the most recent literature upon this topic, and to identify the potential opportunities and challenges for organizations. Overall, this study provides insightful information regarding the potential of Industry 4.0 and its implications for different contexts. The article’s structure begins with a framework about the main subjects that are addressed in this paper. Then the used methodology is presented, as well as the respective results of the academic research based on the chosen criteria.

Sometimes, the synthetic creation resembles a real person or their voice, and we call them deepfakes. Deepfakes are used for multiple purposes, including malicious ones. This makes them a major concern due to the widespread lack of information about their existence and because they are increasingly generated more realistically. It is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate them from real content. In this study, we evaluate human ability to differentiate between a real and a synthetic face. The results indicate that people are unable to differentiate between real images and deepfakes, but that some training slightly improves these results. Therefore, our hypothesis is that human accuracy in identifying synthetic faces could be improved with thorough training on how to detect deepfake faces.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211622","deepfakes;artificial intelligence;signal processing;StyleGan2;human ability;synthetic face","Training;Deepfakes;Generative adversarial networks;Faces;Synthetic data;Information systems","","","","20","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the areas that can benefit most from these technologies is clearly the area of accessible tourism. However, accessible tourism, despite being associated with a market with great potential, is still largely ignored, due to the existence of some barriers. Technology-based solutions can help to overcome some obstacles, increasing the potential of this market. Therefore, this paper aims to present a study in the area of accessible tourism, integrating the main requirements of this type of market, and, consequently, design a web-based information system. To design the solution, a methodology centered on the users was adopted, followed by the conceptualization, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. Given the importance of these types of solutions and the lack of them in the field of accessible tourism, this study is expected to contribute with a positive response to the needs raised in that market, presenting a proposal for a technological solution that can help in the promotion of accessible tourism products and services.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211482","accessible tourism (AT);information systems (IS);people with special needs (PwSN);UML model;user requirements","Unified modeling language;Education;Prototypes;Organizations;Proposals;Stakeholders;Reliability","","","","32","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These institutions of memory, study, preservation and disclosure of the material and immaterial heritage have, by the way, integrated the various information and communication technologies in their documentation, research and exhibition practices as allies in the search for a more open and involving existence. A posture that clearly moves away from the increasingly outdated idea that the museum is a closed, watertight space that only stores artefacts of the most diverse nature. The recognition and valorisation of the potential of interaction between the visitor and the information and communication technologies have gained new forms and roles expressed in an increasing number of research projects and museographic experiences. Many of these projects find precisely in art a fruitful area for the development of experimental prototypes of applications and experiences that bring together Virtual Reality, diverse material and immaterial artistic heritage, the visitor's experience, museums as spaces of memory and knowledge, also, creativity. This article presents the results of an investigation that designed, prototyped and evaluated a Virtual Reality experience about the artist Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso in collaboration with the Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso Municipal Museum in Amarante. The research carried out including the construction of a theoretical corpus formed by structuring concepts in the area of Virtual Reality, as part of the universe of Extended Realities; a detailed look at the cycle of the museum experience, also, by a careful collection of existing projects in the area under study; the development and evaluation of a high-fidelity prototype.

Discrete event simulation plays a fundamental role complementing the study of queueing models as it can model and simulate real-life scenarios. Therefore, this work proposes the development of a functional extension (library) in Python for discrete event simulations, capable of reproducing and performing performance studies of different models available in the literature, in different computational systems. To validate our proposed solution, we used the SMPL functional extension developed by M. H. MacDougall in C language.

Several tools can help manage milking waves and the milking process, such as the Body Condition Score (BCS), an important tool for analyzing cattle health and making intelligent decisions to optimize milk production on a farm. Although the BCS is a useful tool, it is not widely used due to the difficulty of performing its analysis, as it has been found that manual assessments can be very time-consuming on large farms with hundreds of cows. Therefore, it would be useful to automate this process. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic classification of BCS of cattle using computer vision techniques based primarily on deep learning systems, machine learning techniques or linear regression, and classical image processing. This systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using standard methods for documentary research. The SLR included a search for related research and the current state of the art for cattle body condition classification. By exploring the potential of modern systems, this work is expected to provide a new perspective on the automatic classification of BCS and enable a more accurate and reliable evaluation of cattle body condition.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211950","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211950","body condition score;cow;image processing;machine learning;deep learning;classification;computer vision","Systematics;Dairy products;Bibliographies;Linear regression;Production;Manuals;Cows","","","","32","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The practice of this fundamental right lays the foundations of a democratic society that allows the participation of all. In this context, States are obliged to protect this right. However, in many cases this right is abused through the dissemination of information that is not real or objective. This problem has become evident in the Peruvian context in which many opponents of the government of former President Pedro Castillo denounced that he had won with fraud. In this context, the main objective of the study is to analyze the overflow of the limits of freedom of expression within the framework of the results of the 2021 Peruvian presidential elections, in which it has been indicated that the former president won through fraud, a matter that did not really occur because the respective tests have not been evidenced. Likewise, the excesses of freedom of expression of some media, politicians and lawyers who were against the candidacy of former President Castillo are analyzed. A qualitative methodology based on discourse analysis (of politicians, lawyers and the candidate who had lost the elections) has been used, which has been disseminated in various media (television or newspapers), Facebook or Twitter, as well as videos. where they express that there has been fraud in the presidential elections.

This relationship with joint trust promotes knowledge exchange that helps develop more qualified researchers and professionals. The Action Research (AR) method combines theory and practice, and studies involving industry-academia collaboration (IAC) have shown encouraging results. Nevertheless, further investigation is required to verify the effects of applying this method. This research investigates the perceptions of academic master’s and doctoral program students and professionals involved in projects that applied the AR method as a strategy to foster IAC. This article replicates a case study with different projects that conducted an AR in software companies. This study indicated high satisfaction among students (83%) when using action research in the course. All students considered the practical knowledge very relevant and would like to use the method again in other opportunities throughout their academic and professional life. This investigation showed that conducting IAC projects using the AR method within the industry in an educational context was challenging. That occurred due to the lack of experience in using empirical methods. Also, the professional’s unavailability delayed the results and, consequently, the activities in the project that already had a very tight schedule.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211674","Industry-Academia Collaboration;Action Research;Collaborative Practice Research;Replication","Industries;Technological innovation;Schedules;Collaboration;Medical services;Companies;Software","","1","","34","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These unpleasant events incur expensive costs for individuals, companies, and authorities, and as a result, identity theft concerns them greatly. Although scholars of information security have devoted their efforts to developing technology to prevent identity theft, it is not clear what factors influence an individual’s security protection motivation. Few empirical and behavioral studies on this topic have been conducted. To fill this gap, this study extends the protection motivation theory with anxiety, elucidating the influences of a future negative event (identity theft) on an individual’s current emotion, which in turn determines protection motivation. This study proposes a research model that explores the influences of threat appraisal (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) and coping appraisal (response efficacy and self-efficacy) on anxiety, which affects protection motivation. The results in this study provide a more holistic comprehension of identity theft and protection motivation, and can be referred to when developing efficient security guidance and practices.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211980","identity theft;protection motivation theory;anxiety;information security","Costs;Anxiety disorders;Information security;Companies;Appraisal;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","","","","44","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies present a range of opportunities to address challenges in the energy industry. In this study, we propose a methodology to implement a VR and AR system for the energy electric company Eletronorte that facilitates visualization, navigation, and interaction with the arrangements and components of the HVDC system substations. The project involves developing modeling techniques to improve the representation of the components, updating preventive maintenance procedures, and creating a system monitoring environment using VR and AR, enabling engineering teams to interact with field teams and integrate real and virtual systems. VR simulations will provide a safe and controlled environment for training and testing, while AR simulations can be used to provide real-time guidance to technicians in the field.

The model considers the effect of countermeasures such as vaccination and quarantine, and the consequences of the progressive loss of immunity. A deterministic formulation and a first stochastic version of the model are presented, and their implementation in MATLAB is evaluated and compared. To cope with the computational demands of the application of the Monte Carlo method, the implementation of the stochastic version follows a parallel approach that proved to be highly scalable and efficient in a multi-core computational system. The preliminary evaluation results, with fixed parameters, point to a cyclic evolution of the pandemic and a tendency for stabilization in the future.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10212021","Foundation for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212021","COVID-19;post-pandemic scenario;stochastic SEIR model;MATLAB;parallel simulations","COVID-19;Adaptation models;Monte Carlo methods;Pandemics;Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Computational efficiency","","","","9","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evaluating the relationship between the number of cameras and the storage methods is crucial in proposing strategies that ensure reliability and availability at the lowest possible cost. It is important to verify the criticality levels of the images to be stored to determine which storage configuration will be used. The results indicate that the storage method (distributed or replicated volumes) has distinct impacts on hardware usage and electricity consumption. For example, it was possible to observe that the use of replicated volumes increases electrical consumption by about 6.17% with 100 cameras, compared to the distributed mode, and that the greatest impact on performance is in the utilization of the video management system CPU, independent of the storage mode.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211770","GlusterFS;Video surveillance;Performance evaluation.","Performance evaluation;Energy consumption;Costs;Accident prevention;Cameras;Video surveillance;Hardware","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An extended modification of occlusion sensitivity allows the generation of saliency maps based on the effect of occlusions on the evaluation metric. Such a perturbation-based post-hoc interpretability method can be used to visualize those image regions that the selected segmentation class is most sensitive to. We observe that, compared to classification cases, the evaluation metric scores for segmentation remain similar to each other even after occlusions. To generate more color intensities in the saliency map, we use normalization and standardization techniques.

"Improving the Process of Gamified Systems Development by Emphasising Usability","",,"2023 18th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI)","15 Aug 2023","2023","","","1","6","Gamification of various processes is gaining recognition as an effective means of increasing motivation, engagement, and satisfaction of people involved in activities not associated with games, such as education, healthcare, or work. Gamified processes do not have to be computerized, but if they are, the software systems used during them typically share a host of specific characteristics putting them on a separate shelf, typically as a subtype of information systems. This creates the demand for specialised development methodologies that would merge traditional software life cycle with gamification processes. At the same time, it is known that the level of user participation, which is highly critical for gamified systems, depends significantly on the usability of the system. In this paper, we present a generalized gamified systems development methodology and its extended version that emphasizes high usability of the final product. To achieve it, actions must be taken both during the requirements specification, when the game components and usability requirements can be chosen based on the parameters of the given gamification project, and during evaluation of intermediate or final results of the development.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211369","gamification;gamified information systems;software development process;usability","Education;Games;Medical services;Software systems;Usability;Optimization;Information systems","","","","12","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such datasets may contain redundant, noisy, and irrelevant features that could potentially have a negative influence on decision-making processes. In particular, we have addressed a feature selection question to identify player attributes that contribute the most to being chosen by an NBA team for a professional contract. In this context, this paper proposes a data mining approach using a feature selection method to identify relevant characteristics and rank features to assist stakeholders in decision-making processes. Thus, we have used a data mining approach in terms of a feature selection method by testing some models and performing a combination of genetic algorithm with decision tree and SVM. Feature selection is an important step in the data mining process that allows for obtaining better results using a lower number of features. To this end, we performed an experimental study to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with datasets from the NCAA repository, mainly comparing it with conventional feature selection algorithms from the categories Wrapper, Filter, and Embedding, using SVM and Decision Tree as classifiers. The results show that the proposed feature selection technique outperforms the other used methods on this feature selection problem. The results also show that in this specific model, the dataset was reduced from 65 features to only 6, and metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score showed the best values for both the proposed feature selection technique. Furthermore, we found that dbpm, treb, and ogbpm are the three best predictors to determine the tendency of a player to reach the NBA.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211486","NCAA;NBA;Genetic Algorithm;Decision Tree;SVM;Attribute Selection;Basketball","Support vector machines;Decision making;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Data mining;Decision trees","","","","12","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate this issue, we constructed a framework for providing adaptive feedback, covering different approaches and feedback resources in problem-solving by novice programmers. The body of knowledge represented in the proposed framework is helpful to be presented to TAs, who should use it to guide their pedagogical decision-making process regarding adaptive feedback in synthesis and analysis. To this end, we developed the framework based on two main stages: (1) conception and (2) brainstorming and evolution. The conception stage, which gave rise to the first version of the framework, included an ad hoc literature review of feedback provision. Hence, we conducted a brainstorming with introductory programming teachers to analyze the framework in terms of coverage and its potential to enable the teaching assistants to provide adaptive feedback.

AutoML tools are known for their ability to perform model selection with little human intervention, improving the accuracy and reliability of the results. However, conducting a model space search among pre-trained NLP models can be computationally infeasible, making it challenging to determine the optimal NLP model for a given dataset. This research aims to enhance the performance of NLP model selection. Our approach has resulted in higher accuracy than existing methods on the dataset that was created.

One of the ways to solve the problem is with the use of Edge Computing networks, such paradigm allows the transfer of the data processing to the edges of the network. Since the Edge is mostly composed of devices of varied and limited computational capacity, a good way to distribute the tasks that must be processed is needed. Therefore, efficient, and well tested, scheduling algorithms are a way to distribute tasks in such a way that the time required to perform them is minimized.

For this reason, this article proposes a cybersecurity framework composed of controls from ISO/IEC 27001 and the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to mitigate cyber-threats against SMEs in Peru. The framework consists of 7 steps having as reference the Deming cycle (PDCA). For the implementation of the composite framework, we worked with 12 domains and 40 controls for a Peruvian SME in the technology sector. The results showed an increase in cybersecurity of $40 \%$, after applying the 40 controls, improving its level of maturity from the “insufficient” state to a “mature” state, according to the assessment given.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211874","Cybersecurity;Framework;ISO/IEC 27001;SMEs;controls;cyber-attacks;CFS NIST","Pandemics;ISO Standards;NIST;IEC Standards;Computer crime;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then fuzzy ontology and epistemology will be defined. The relationships between logic, ontology and epistemology will be described and, finally, it will be concluded by presenting the assumptions on which a fuzzy ontology can be built considering that reality itself is fuzzy, as the difference between the different entities that they compose it is not of essence but of degree and that this fuzzy ontology implies in turn a fuzzy epistemology.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211472","Fuzzy logic;ontology;epistemology","Fuzzy logic;Buildings;Ontologies;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Academics, citizens, and decision-makers from different levels of government have a surging interest in knowing how to properly frame and adapt the transforming demands, opportunities, and social patterns brought by technologies which allow sharing data and processes, expanding digital capabilities, and combining services and governance models. In parallel, concerns over accountability, access and participation take up more space in the debate around digitalization of governments. On the one hand, technology can be used to legitimize the public sector, bringing citizens closer to politics, and reducing civic apathy. Yet, on the other hand, if this digitalization process is left unquestioned, the foundations of democracy as we know it will be eroded. Therefore, this research aims at identifying the ‘platformization’ level of Portuguese municipalities, by building an Index that combines both qualitative and quantitative data, through an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach. Additionally, an in-depth analysis will be conducted using comparative methods, in order to capture distinctive patterns within selected municipalities. The outputs of this research are expected to contribute not only for mapping Portuguese municipalities’ penetration of digital platforms, but also for broadening the evidence on the impacts of these technologies on public scrutiny, citizen participation and legitimacy in the context of local democracies.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211805","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211805","Local governments;Digital platforms;Democracy;Public scrutiny;Citizen Participation.","Adaptation models;Government;Buildings;Information sharing;Data models;Indexes;Information systems","","","","44","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An alternative that has proven to be viable is the investment in medium Priority transport, such as BRT, VLT, among others, as they do not compete directly with other vehicles on the road, and operate on exclusive routes, although in competition with general traffic, with a differentiated fee collection method (before boarding), thus allowing greater confidence in the vehicle at its destination within a planned time interval, improving the cost-benefit ratio. Evaluating metrics such as performance, reliability and performability help in the planning, monitoring and optimization of STUMPs. This article presents hierarchical models, using CTMC modeling techniques, to evaluate metrics such as performance and performability. The results show that these models pointed out the peak intervals most likely to reach the destination in the shortest time, in addition to showing the probability of the vehicle being affected by the failure in each interval.

However, it continues to be very difficult to effectively quantify the engagement of a player with a board game, which might be relevant for some use cases. We employed electronic sensors to measure a specific biosignal, namely the galvanic skin response, or electrodermal activity, which is the most reliable indicator for emotional activation. Our initial hypothesis is that this biosignal can be used to objectively assess the player engagement with the game, by monitoring the level of emotional activation during gameplay. Results indicate that an approach based on biometric monitoring that includes the electrodermal activity of players, eventually coupled with other relevant biosignals, can be used to identify different engagement levels of players in board game sessions. More work will be required to establish correlations and link observed signal patterns to events and eventually to specific characteristics of games, but the proposed approach is promising towards quantifying user experience and engagement in board games without relying on subjective indirect assessment methods.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211662","board game;game experience;analog games;player engagement;biometric monitoring;electrodermal activity","Correlation;Biometrics (access control);Games;Skin;User experience;Sensors;Velocity measurement","","","","22","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sin embargo, estos datos no siempre están disponibles para muchas áreas aisladas de la ciudad que podrían aprovechar esta energía. Para estas zonas la posibilidad de predecir los valores de radiación solar suele ser la única forma de conocer estos datos si se desea utilizar esta energía para otro uso. Por estas razones, hemos diseñado un modelo capaz de pronosticar la radiación solar en tiempo real a partir de variables meteorológicas medidas en una Estación instalada en la Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (ubicada en una zona algo aislada de Lima Perú). Nuestro modelo, logra predecir la real Radiación Solar de dicha zona utilizando modelos computacionales basados en Redes Neuronales Artificiales (RNA), utilizando 11 variables obtenidas de la estación meteorológica como: humedad relativa, temperatura del aire, punto de roció, velocidad de viento, entre otras, logramos realizar la predicción.

In response to this situation, an attempt has been made to address the problem with a view to improving student performance in order to avoid school failure and dropout. In this sense, innovative methodologies have emerged to solve this situation. One of them is the Flipped Classroom, which is characterized by using information and communication technologies to improve student learning with the use of digital educational resources in the classroom or outside of it, thus favoring not only the understanding, application of knowledge and improvement of school performance, but also the stimulation of students’ interest by considering themselves as protagonists and main actors in their learning process. This study proposes the development of a Learning Management System (LMS) to improve student learning. This LMS prototype uses the Flipped Classroom Methodology applied in one syllable during a period of one month in the subject of cultural and artistic education. This subject is distributed as follows: 1.- Initial Assessment; 2.- Heritage; 3.- Types of Heritage; 4.- Cultural Heritage; 5.- Natural Heritage; 6.- Final evaluation.

In the governmental sphere, the use of these solutions provides the improvement of the provision of public services, as well as the reduction of their costs. However, the diversity of subjects under the responsibility of the same public body presents itself as a challenge to the development of a chatbot. This is because the more subjects to be dealt with, the more likely the chatbot is ambiguous in their responses. To solve this problem, this work proposes the use of text classification techniques, to enable a tree-based architecture of conversational assistants. In this architecture, a general knowledge chatbot can identify the subject of the user’s message and forward it to specific chatbots. The feasibility of the proposal was evaluated from the performance of experiments, which compared three implementation strategies for text classification: multiclass classifier, binaries classifiers and one-class classifier. The results of the experiments showed a better performance, in relation to the Fl-score and accuracy metrics, of the multiclass and binary classifiers. However, it was concluded that the use of one-class classifiers greater benefits to the hierarchical chatbots, because it allows independence between the models created, which results in greater scalability and simplicity of the proposed architecture.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211721","chatbot;conversational assistants;text classification;tree-organized chatbot;e-Gov","Measurement;Costs;Scalability;Text categorization;Government;Chatbots;Proposals","","","","36","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two different tools were compared: a 360° immersive environment and a totally virtual immersive environment. A questionnaire was applied before and after the intervention, assessing empathy, social distance, and attitudes towards the person with schizophrenia. The results suggest an increase in empathy, characterized by the increase in the activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as a change in heart rate representing an activation of the Autonomic Nervous System. Questionnaire responses corroborate these findings.

Three different practices were planned, and their respective procedure guides were elaborated as didactic material. The first one was intended to familiarize telecommunications students with the graphical interface of frequency hopping spread spectrum simulation with the definition of the required parameters and technical conditions. The second was aimed at sending and visualizing the information with the possibility of varying the sequence code that follows the carrier hopping. Finally, with the third practice it was possible to analyze the errors and synchronization failures of the pseudo code for the hopping sequence.

Sensory therapies, which often involve prolonged periods of sitting and doing repetitive tasks, can become boring and result in decreased attention and motivation, hindering the child’s progress in therapy. To address this, the virtual reality tool, called “Sensory Space Work,” utilizes gaming and VR elements to hold the child’s interest and keep them motivated. The tool also features a database to track the child’s progress and activity, making it easier for therapists to monitor their progress.

Resilient and sustainable food systems are needed to survive against all these risks. The Food and Agriculture Organization has envisioned that this only would be possible if we put together large urban centers, the conglomeration of smaller cities in their surrounds and the surrounding and interspersed peri-urban and rural hinterland in a unique City-Region Food System (CRFS). CRFS, however, will be only an opportunity if all food agents in the area collaborate together as part of the same network. This collaboration must overcome the potential conflict of interest and the lack of trust among the different agents, so transparency and accountability must be improved in all transactions. Therefore, in this paper we describe a data-driven blockchain-based marketplace where food agents in a CRFS can share and get transparent and accountable information about other industries, users, or producers in the region. To motivate food agents to join the platform, information in the marketplace is not free and consumers must pay a fee before getting it, generating new income flow for participants. The system is supported by Ethereum network and web technologies. An initial experience was carried out to validate the proposed marketplace in the context of a CRFS living lab in Spain.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211587","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211587","Ethereum;blockchain;City-Region Food System;Cities2030;information management;transparency","Food waste;Climate change;Additives;Urban areas;Collaboration;Production;Organizations","","","","30","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Companies display advertisements for these types of products and describe them as beneficial. However, users are looking for the products that best suit their personal needs, for which they often review the opinions of other users on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. In this research, we study the opinion of users who have used physical activity trackers, to assess whether their satisfaction meets the quality offered by the manufacturer. Through: the use of natural language processing techniques, and the analysis of information provided in Amazon reviews. A sentiment analysis was carried out based on the technical characteristics of the device. We employ transfer learning of a Transformer-based language model (RoBERTa: Robustly optimized BERT Pretraining Approach). Which was retrained for two classification problems in independent modules, the first module classified 20 technical aspects of the device (93% precision), and the second module classified user sentiments (70% precision). A comparison was made between the average feeling of the user vs. the manufacturer, getting a 3.11 for users and 3.99 for manufacturers with a difference of 0.88, concluding that the user’s sentiment having a lower expectation than the manufacturers.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211474","BERT;sentiment analysis;nlp;data augmentation","Heart rate;Sentiment analysis;Obesity;Transfer learning;Manuals;Transformers;Labeling","","","","16","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several activities that can be optimized is the dispatch planning (timetabling dispatch problem), usually performed manually with tools such as spreadsheets, which invests time and does not facilitate the adjustment of a dispatch plan, nor does it guarantee an optimal or error-free result. In the present study, a virus colony search (VCS) algorithm for schedule allocation applied to dispatching in a plant with multiple bays has been developed. The approach is oriented to the search of maximizing the dispatch of products in the different bays, for which the dispatch orders must be prioritized and the dead time minimized, considering the different constraints such as special orders that need to be loaded at a particular time.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211755","timetabling;virus colony search;dispatch;optmization;supply chain management","Schedules;Supply chains;Loading;Search problems;Scheduling;Dispatching;Resource management","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no doubt that this demographic change is a major challenge, but also an opportunity that seeks to take advantage of this new market niche, the so-called Silver Economy. In this line, the tourism sector has to adapt its offer to the Silver Economy, and more specifically to the Silver Tourists, by offering an aging-friendly offer adapted to the environment and taking advantage of new technologies. Today, one of the best ways to access updated tourist information is through chatbots and voice assistants that can offer a new intelligent interface that has all the tourist offers updated in real-time. However, there are large rural areas where there is no Internet connectivity. This circumstance limits tourists’ access to the Internet and, consequently, to all information.

Choosing a software architecture is something that will impact the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) and, as such, should be seen as an extremely important task. A monolithic architecture enables a fast initial development, however there are several limits after a certain point. A microservices architecture is highly scalable and can handle many clients simultaneously, but it is too complex to be used at an early stage of software development. If the software grows, it will have to scale, and an architecture migration may be necessary.

For this purpose, a content analysis of 78 Audit Reports was carried out and measures of association between the variables under study were applied. The results proved that the COVID-19 influences the audit report only at the level of emphases emission. This study presents contributions, as it deals with a current and little explored theme, innovating also by the fact that it analyses the COVID-19 as a determining factor of the Audit Report.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10212012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212012","Auditing;Audit Report;COVID-19","COVID-19;Uncertainty;Current measurement;Companies;Information systems;Business","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides the quality of the products, there is currently also a growing concern about the origin of the products and the path they take to reach the final consumers. Consumers are demanding transparency across the entire value chain of the products they consume. That’s why it’s necessary to design and develop traceability platforms for these products. The platform must be able to collect information at all stages of the supply chain and store it in a system external and shared by all operators in the value chain. This information must be available to all participants in the supply chain, including farmers, health authorities, government industries, sellers, retailer, final consumers, and any other actor involved in the value chain. This article describes the planning and implementation of a platform that allows to trace back and forth fruits and vegetables. This platform would be decentralized by using a blockchain-based approach.

Olive oil is one of the basic ingredients used in Mediterranean cuisine. Olive oil is appreciated for its great nutritional value, which depends, in part, on how it is produced and cultivated. Olive oil production is sometimes frowned upon because it can consume a lot of water, especially new varieties of irrigated olive trees. Some olive oil productions are more environmentally friendly than others. The implementation of traceability along the olive oil production chain, and throughout its entire value chain, is essential to promote transparency, through the registration of values that allow the assessment of quality and environmental impact, among other values that allow guaranteeing the provenance, variety, and quality of the olives, ensuring the authenticity of the final product. Thus, the consumer can decide which bottle of olive oil they want to buy, based on reliable and accurate information about the quality and environmental sustainability of the olive oil to purchase. This article presents the implementation of an olive oil traceability platform based on Blockchain and presents and analyzes the result of using the proposed platform for the 2022 harvest in a farm in the north of Portugal.

The present study aims to analyze the evolution of scientific production on the effect of the announcement of F&A operations at the level of abnormal returns. This review was elaborated using formal methods of bibliometric analysis and the process of collection and selection of articles was carried out in the Scopus database. The final selection had 205 documents from 2012 to 2022, aiming to analyze the recent literature on this topic. The results suggest that the total number of publications on this topic has been increasing, reaching in 2022, the maximum number of articles published. Regarding the most relevant authors, there is not only one highlight, since four authors present a total of four published articles. The most relevant journal is the Journal of Corporate Finance, where fifteen articles were published in a total of 205 and the most cited by the documents analyzed was the Journal of Financial Economics. The countries that have the most published articles on this topic are the USA, the UK, Australia, China and India. However, the continents that are most investigated are the American and Asian continent, and there is a lack of recent studies investigating the European continent and there is also no evidence of research relating the markets of different continents.

Also, the adoption of digital solutions and the use of data will support the transition to a climate-neutral, circular, and more resilient economy. In that context, taxation rules are a valuable tool for government intervention with businesses. To encourage the adherence of companies to the mandatory implementation of new invoicing or accounting technologies, the Portuguese State granted a tax incentive to micro and SMEs that adopted these tools before the deadlines set for their entry into force. This paper relies on an exploratory analysis of the Portuguese micro and SMEs companies that took advantage of the tax incentive under study, in the years 2020 and 2021, also framing this tax incentive in the digital transformation process of companies in their local context. The results reveal that only 373 companies took advantage of this tax incentive. Nevertheless, the value of the tax incentive is positively associated with the average net profit value, the average value of operational income, the average value of turnover and the average value of income tax. This is, from the authors’ point of view, an innovative study, as it brings to discussion the theme of a tax policy designed to promote environmental sustainability, associated with the accounting and tax processes of companies, in the context of digital transformation.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211325","Foundation for Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211325","Tax incentives;Digitalization;Sustainability;Digital Transformation;Portugal","Digital transformation;Green products;Government;Linear regression;Force;Finance;Companies","","","","28","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this paper is to present the first research phase of the aforementioned study, which aims at analyzing the state of the art of the training in Accounting offered by Portuguese public higher education institutions. Specifically, it aims to identify in the syllabuses of accounting courses: i) which competences are being covered; ii) which teaching, learning and assessment methodologies and which educational resources are being used. It is considered that this phase of research will assist in the collection of guidelines for designing, implementing and evaluating an accounting teacher training program. Preliminary results showed that training has privileged the development of technical competence, using methodologies based on theoretical-practical classes, where theory is presented in a lecture by the teacher and practice is carried out through the resolution of cases and exercises. Accounting teachers tend to prioritize more traditional assessments, through assignments, tests, exams and examinations. Finally, digital resources are still scarcely mentioned in the syllabus.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211384","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211384","Competencies;Accounting training;learning methodologies;assessment methodologies;digital resources","Training;Buildings;Europe;Transforms;Problem-solving;Standards;Guidelines","","","","23","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In turn, the public sector is the target of a third of the cyberattacks detected in Portugal and municipalities are the most targeted by cybercriminals. Therefore, it is urgent to assess how these institutions are preparing for a possible new wave of attacks and how internal audit can play an important role in mitigating risks. Starting from a questionnaire to the intermunicipal communities of the Region of Coimbra, Viseu Dão- Lafões and Alto Alentejo which are constituted by a significant number of Municipalities and from a literature review, it is intended to make known the state of the art in matters of cybersecurity and its intrinsic relationship with internal auditing in these entities.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211653","risk management;audit;cybersecurity","Systematics;Bibliographies;Organizations;Behavioral sciences;Risk management;Computer crime;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, there is a need to create a tool capable of providing a better quality of data presentation, monitoring the relevant indicators, and supporting managers in the decision-making process, such as, in this case, the dashboard. In this sense, this research focuses on the development of a tactical dashboard for the Regional Directorate of Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness (DREC), based in Ponta Delgada, island of São Miguel, Portugal. Thus, through a questionnaire to promoters and interviews with two specialists, 33 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) were defined, capable of evaluating the Support Program for Restaurants and Hospitality. In this context, a dashboard sheet was developed that presents the KPI, supported on the literature review and in the interviews. The positive evaluation of the dashboard by the experts leads to the conclusion that it is, in fact, possible to monitor the application of the PARH through a dashboard. Additionally, it is understood that this tool can analyze the performance of the PARH with the pre-established objectives. This research allows, not only to contribute to the knowledge of relevant KPI in financial support programs, but also to explore another dashboard directly associated with the perspective of financial support managers and other users, thus facilitating their decision making.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211877","Financial Support;Dashboard;Autonomous Region of the Azores","Bibliographies;Key performance indicator;Decision making;Entrepreneurship;Interviews;Monitoring;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The damage caused by perpetrating fraudulent acts is extremely costly, even if its impact may not be exclusively financial. Considering that fraud prevention does not always keep up with the evolution of the phenomenon, several techniques have been studied in the literature to seek effective fraud detection and minimize its impact. Benford’s Law is one of the analytical techniques aimed to assist in the effective detection of fraud and the purpose of this paper, oriented towards a literature review, is to evaluate the true role of Benford’s Law in this area. Regarding the evidence gathered in this study, it was concluded that Benford’s Law is a powerful analytical tool that enables the identification of anomalous data, with low implementation costs, and allows redirecting the greatest efforts to a further moment of analysis. It should be seen as a pointer for instances that deviate from the expected pattern, which should be analyzed by more robust tools. As it is applied at an early stage of the process, Benford’s Law could be seen as a genuine left hand in fraud detection.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211738","fraud detection;Benford’s Law;analytics tools","Costs;Bibliographies;Organizations;Fraud;Information systems","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
