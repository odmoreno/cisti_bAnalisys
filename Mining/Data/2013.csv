Additionally, it is important that this information may be linked to other sources, in particular, with the reports of LCMS, in such a way as to promote a more coherent management. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the scale ""LCMS integration in teaching activities of higher education"". The methodological approach to the subject has developed along three steps: 1-Identification and development of the dimensions and writing of individual items; 2-Validation of the content of the instrument by a panel of experts and graduate students with deep experience in the use of the LCMS; 3-Administration of scale and psychometric analysis. The dimensions of the final version of the scale are related very closely with information from reports of LCMS. The objective is to analyze, crossing information from two sources, a factor which potentially increases management effectiveness. It was constituted a convenience sample of 54 students attending undergraduate and master's Universidade Católica do Porto. The results suggest that the scale has good psychometric properties.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615700","Evaluation scale;institutional Managed Learning Environment (iMLE);Learnig Analytics;Learning Content Management System (LCMS)","Instruments;Least squares approximations;Content management;Electronic learning;Blogs;Process control","","","","39","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last two decades considerable contributions incorporating creative mechanisms in computer applications were made. Recently, the discussion is turning towards the problems that are under the process of evaluating computer created visual objects, mainly in the area related to the automating aesthetic evaluation. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of the process of evaluating visual objects (with the help of human cognitive process of evaluation) in the specific area of visual arts, within computerized systems. By means of an empirical and automated approach we surveyed human subjects for the classification of the concept of creativity. Simultaneously, 804 features were extracted from around 2600 images used in order to model the human classification through an artificial neural network. This work proposes the use of classification models to understand the human creativity perception in a set of images. This is an important aspect not only to classify a product as being novel, but also to provide information about the creativity perception.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615706","Creativity;Visual Arts;Artificial Intelligence;Data Mining","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Art;Visualization;Computers;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models","","","","22","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, these devices are more and more important not only in business contexts, but also in particular ones. The efficiency of a user performing a task with a mobile device can drastically vary because of its context dependency. Therefore, it is vital to measure the efficiency of the user regarding the surrounding environment. The current methods tend to discard the variation of characteristics of the context where a mobile application is executed. Through this work a new context and interaction model focused on mobile applications is exposed. First, the capture method that adds the minimum deviations caused by external factors to the assessment results has been studied. Then, a system based on a library for Android devices that captures and measures the defined model and the user efficiency is shown and validated.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615709","HCI;mobile services;assesment;context-aware;effectiveness;quality","Context modeling;Software;Androids;Humanoid robots;Internet;Mobile communication;Context","","2","","11","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In architecture, shape grammars can work with rules which will convey legal restrictions, space needs and goals that the architect needs or wants to fulfil, creating possible solutions to a project. A wide range of solutions can be tested in computational application based in shape grammars. These applications can also encourage the architect to go further in his creativity through the shape emergence where the conditions are fulfilled and presented as innovative and/or unexpected. Due to the strict rules they have to obey and to the issues they are supposed to respond and, not being a mere artistic intention but rather a response to a specific need/objective intention (space building), architectural projects show a set of common phases which might take a lot of advantages from computational applications and at the same time respond not only to the technical needs but also to the creative goals.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615710","shape grammar;Computational Creativity;architectural Project","Shape;Grammar;Floors;Law;Artificial intelligence","","","","14","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Persuasion is one of them and it is predominantly based in first order logic. However, this type of dialogue is not an adequate approach for solving complex problems - those that can't be solved in polynomial time. This paper presents a persuasion model for MAS which consider the fitness function of a genetic algorithm (GA) for reaching agreements in problem solving. The resulting persuasion model provides each member of MAS with a fitness function capable of guiding agents in the reach of agreements. The evaluation we did enabled us to state that the model could have a positive impact for solving complex problems with MAS. In contrast with previous studies, our results highlight the importance of using a GA persuasion model for solving complex problems and we depict the implications of our findings in its design considerations.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615722","Multi-agent systems;persuasion;genetic algorithms;model;negotiation","Unified modeling language;Genetic algorithms;Silicon compounds;Adaptation models;Multi-agent systems;Abstracts;Polynomials","","","","20","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This means that an attack on one asset can be propagated through the network and threaten an organization's most valuable assets. It is necessary to valuate all assets, the direct and indirect asset dependencies, as well as the probability of threats and the resulting asset degradation. However, the experts in charge to assign such values often provide only vague and uncertain information. Fuzzy logic can be very helpful in such situation, but it is not free of some difficulties, such as the need of a proper arithmetic to the model under consideration or the establishment of appropriate similarity measures. Throughout this paper we propose a fuzzy treatment for risk analysis models promoted by international methodologies through the establishment of such elements.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615747","análisis de riesgos;sistemas de información;números difusos trapezoidales","Silicon;Risk analysis;Nickel;Information systems;Silicon compounds;Tiles;Abstracts","","","","26","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although PACS integration with web-based technologies offer significant advantages to healthcare institutions, it is crucial that information technology based issues do not impose constraints in the medical practice workflow. Therefore, distributed PACS have to deal with performance issues in both storing and retrieving of large amounts of data across distinct systems, possibly hosted on different locations. This paper proposes an approach to reduce data transference footprint in a distributed PACS environment with DICOM-Ready applications. The proposed method provides a high level control of transference parameters, such as, number of connections, number of fragments and size of each fragment. The result was a highly tunable data stream that can be used in any distributed PACS environment.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615752","Medical Imaging;PACS;DICOM;Data Transmission","DICOM;Picture archiving and communication systems;Routing protocols;Bridges;Image coding","","1","","15","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cosine similarity is widely used because of it's independence from document length, allowing the identification of patterns, more specifically, two documents can be seen as identical if they share the same words but have different frequencies. However, during each clustering iteration new centroids are still computed following Euclidean distance. Based on a consideration of these two measures we propose the k-Communities clustering algorithm (k-C) which changes the computing of new centroids when using cosine similarity. It begins by selecting the seeds considering a network of tags where a community detection algorithm has been implemented. Each seed is the document which has the greater degree inside its community. The experimental results found through implementing external evaluation measures show that the k-C algorithm is more effective than both the k-means and k-means++. Besides, we implemented all the external evaluation measures, using both a manual and an automatic “Ground Truth”, and the results show a great correlation which is a strong indicator that it is possible to perform tests with this kind of measures even if the dataset structure is unknown.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615753","clustering;effectiveness;k-means;k-Communities;communitie detection;tagging;cosine similarity","Clustering algorithms;Communities;Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Euclidean distance;Indexes;Classification algorithms","","","","11","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use the taxiproblem (a standard in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning literature) and conclude that, even though this problem's scale is relatively small, in most of the cases subgoals do improve the learning speed, achieving relatively good results faster than standard Q-Learning. We propose a specific iteration interval as the most appropriate to insert subgoals in the learning process. We also found that early adoption of subgoals may lead to suboptimal learning.

This growth has emerged combined with an increasing diversity of equipments capable of receiving video content and an increase in the demand for high definition content, placing new challenges of heterogeneity and scalability to the networks that should support the distribution of such contents. Traditionally the scalability problem has been solved by IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) networks using IP Multicast, supported by networks and equipments administered by private operators, with mechanisms capable of reducing the risks associated with flows that do not respond to congestion. However, on the Internet, such risks have resulted in the lack of implementation of IP Multicast, which in turn affects large-scale distributions of video. This has caused content providers to use so-called Application layer or overlay solutions. In this context, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solutions are currently extensively used for file exchange, making them a natural solution to the point to multipoint distribution of video. Regarding the problem of terminal heterogeneity, the introduction of standards for scalable video compression, allows the distribution of several qualities, targeting a range of equipment terminals with different resolutions and processing capabilities. In this field, this paper evaluates the effect of several P2P parameters associated with the BitTorrent P2P file-sharing protocol for the distribution of H.264 scalable video creating a point-multipoint real-time distribution system capable of delivering the same content to a high number of heterogeneous terminals.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615770","Real Time Video Distribution;Point-Multipoint Distribution;Peer-to-Peer (P2P);H.264 Content;Scalable Video Coding (SVC);BitTorrent","Streaming media;Delays;Real-time systems;Internet;Static VAr compensators;Inductors;Encoding","","","","12","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is why institutions globally have shown a strong interest in the development of models for operational risk management. However, these have come with some limitations, due to the fact that the variables that comprise this type of risk are highly discrete and qualitative with respect to the frequency and severity that characterize a risk event. Thus, in this article a risk measurement model that is based on Fuzzy Petri Nets will be developed and analyzed, which models each of the seven risk events according to the definitions of the Basel II framework. This way each risk event is modeled through a combination of frequency and severity distributions, and finally the capital at risk (CaR) can be estimated.

Therefore, the detailed study of the pedestrian flow is required. The cognitive multi-agent simulation with the cellular automata is an excellent technique in the analysis of flow and the pedestrian behaviors.

Sometimes, this decision is based purely on faith, which is something not everyone is willing to do. For this reason, trust has been identified as one of the key factors for the success of the sharing economy. Over the years trust mechanisms have been developed on a per site basis (i.e. feedback, voting or reputation systems) and users have been slowly building trust in these sites and leaving a reputation trail as they move from site to site. This process should be more efficient and users must be able to use the hard earned reputation to show they are trustworthy. To this end, we present a trust model for improving trust between users, normally in the context of p2p transactions, based on online credibility sources and social network quality metrics. In this paper we formally define a multi-dimensional trust model adapted to p2p marketplaces, introduce WhyTrusted.com prototype as a proof-of-concept that is able to capture, process, and translate data into relevant dimensions of the trust model to measure a person's perceived trustworthiness with a portable, cross-platform trust score, and use an empirical analysis to confirm that the WhyTrusted trust score and source ratings improve a user's propensity to trust.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615790","Trust;Credibility;Reputation;Online Trust;Trust Systems;Sharing Economy","Social network services;Context;Internet;Organizations;Adaptation models;Measurement","","","","19","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, several gelatin-based phantoms have been constructed with scattering agents as flour, starch and glass microspheres. Then, A-Scan lines were extracted using the pulse echo approach, followed by the ultrasound velocity. The obtained results for the considered acoustical parameter present good concordance with the ones found in literature. Methodologies were developed to analyze the using phantoms and human images with and without lesions.

These factors contribute to balance difficulties that eventually lead to falls. The injuries due to falls, at this age, are risky, since most of the times may cause a significant - and permanent - decrease of quality of life or, in extreme cases, death. In this context, a fall detection system can bring an added value to assist elderly people. This paper describes a system consisting of a wearable sensor unit, a smartphone and a website. When the sensor detects a fall it sends an alert using the smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0, to notify the family members or stakeholders. The sensor device includes an inertial unit, a barometer, and a temperature and humidity sensor. The website displays the log of previous falls and enables the configuration of emergency contact numbers. The proposed fall detection system is one of multiple components within a larger project under development that offers a holistic perspective on falls; the complete wearable solution will also feature, among others, physical protection (minimizing the impact of falls that occur).","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615802","Wearable devices;Ambient Assisted Living;Fall detection;Healthcare","Senior citizens;Sociology;Statistics;Bluetooth;Injuries;Accelerometers","","1","5","19","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite its enormous importance in the implementation and success of a data warehouse, there is still no convincing approach to ETL modeling, able to support the various stages of its development and subsequent implementation. That is, an approach that allows their characterization to a more abstract level and later provides its direct mapping in execution primitives. In this paper we propose an approach for modeling and implementing ETL processes based on meta-models (patterns), which represents standard tasks typically used in most real-world ETL systems. For that, we intend to use a series of new BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) constructs, which enables the modeling and validation of such processes, before conducting to its final implementation.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615813","Data Warehouse;ETL Modeling and Validation;BPMN;Patterns and Meta-models","Unified modeling language;Data warehouses;Computational modeling;Data models;Load modeling;Process control;Business","","","","17","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By using the NING platform, we built an online social network that was streamlined for eight months with 45 participants. We achieved many of our original goals while using design-based research and various techniques of collecting and analysing data. The results show that the creation of an informal learning context, which allowed for sharing experiences and building knowledge, was rated very positively by participants. It involved a plural reality with different participation levels: the more active members adopted more ""critical"" and ""creative"" positions while the more passive ones took on the position of ""collector"", ""spectator"" and of someone who was more ""inactive"". We conclude that the potential of Social Software is enabled by the use it is given by the participants and that it is an effective means of overcoming the isolation felt by parents and teachers of children and young people with multiple disabilities.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615820","Informal Learning;Non-formal Learning;Multiple Disabilities;Parental Involvement;Teacher Training;Online Social Networking;Social Software","Software;Training;Blogs;Context;Facebook","","1","","22","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This change, like others, has advantages but also disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages which arose from this modification is the fact that, currently, organizations have lost control over what customers say about them, since they can easily publish their negative opinions and spread them rapidly. However, some organizations have quickly realized this situation could promote important competitive advantages, through the analysis of what customers say about them in different communication channels. Besides that, the increasing use of internet allowed that a lot of information is available online and an example of it is that, nowadays, the majority of newspapers make their publications daily available, on their websites, on the internet. Therefore, the data volume daily available on the internet grows exponentially and all of the information produced through this data might be important, if treated and used correctly. That is how the challenge of creating knowledge through this information in an automated way, emerges. Thus, the goal of this project is to build a model able to evaluate the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) of economic news headlines, available on RSS Feeds addresses. In order to do that, software SAS was used and, consequently its methodology, whose detailed description is also a goal. In this way, section I introduces the subject for a better contextualization. Section II presents the goals for the project which originated this paper, followed by the state of art in the section III.

The demand for Graphical user interface (GUI) testing has very much increased in the last years. An important progress in this field has been achieved, from GUI manual testing to complete automate GUI testing. In this paper, optimization theory and evolutionary algorithms (EA) concepts were applied for GUI testing. In our approach, the GUI is completely separated from the code itself. The aim of the proposed methodology is to find the test case sequence(s) which produce(s) the maximum amount of changes inside the GUI while preserving all other constraints. The method starts by randomly generating the initial set of test cases, which is then improved through measuring and evaluating specific fitness functions. By using optimization theory, very good results were obtained for accelerating the automatic test of large interfaces.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615841","Graphical user interface;automatic testing;evolutionary testing;evolutionary algorithms","Graphical user interfaces;Testing;Software;Manuals;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics","","","","22","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming to contribute to providing a semantic search for information on Health, available using written Portuguese, the article presents enhanced search platform architecture based on the enterprise search platform (FAST), providing a processing pipeline capable of exploring annotation of entities and relations defined in a domain. A modular architecture was defined in which an ontology-based knowledge base has an essential role. As it is essential to make the user task as simple as possible, the platform also includes ontology navigation in the classes and relations of the entity to guide queries; use of the most frequent domain classes in the documents relating to a search to provide additional ways of navigation; and inclusion in the score of the ontology-guided annotations.

Although there are several applications for operationalizing the resolution of contradictions, it appears that there is a lack of current methodologies that address how to manage the contradictions and how they can assist the transformation of organization. In this context, this proposal appears based on an analytical model for analysis of the contradictions in the implementation of an organization.

The study found top management support, perceived benefits, complexity, and competitive pressure to be determinants of ISO adoption in both business areas. Relative advantage was also found influential for finance. Furthermore, attitude toward change was found to have negative effects for both business areas.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615858","Information systems outsourcing (ISO);technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework;diffusion of innovation;human resources ISO adoption;finance ISO adoption","ISO;Technological innovation;Complexity theory;Finance;Organizations;Outsourcing","","","","55","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was a demand from practices where the work implied big teams, and making decisions without seeing each other was a rising problem. Therefore a novel tool has been developed. This tool works like a forum, with the ability of voting. Thus, students can insert proposals and vote them while making decisions in a simple way.

It develops in the context of a joint venture between the company Lusoinfo Multimédia and Instituto de Educação da Universidade do Minho. Its main recipients are educators and teachers of primary schools, children and parents. The project aims to produce digital educational contents, based on innovative processes of designing, production and application. In this article, we had the objective to contribute to the knowledge of the reality of the use of MDII in the formal context of a classroom, to recognize teaching strategies adopted by a teacher and to identify major barriers to the effective use of these contents. The present study, in the form of a case study, took place during the months of April, May and June 2012 about a fourth grade class of an elementary school. Results show that the educational games in the classroom can be, in fact, features drivers of new strategies for teaching and learning. However, their use alone does not determine a most successful learning process, so it is important to understand the limitations on the effective use of these digital means. We identified one of these limitations: teacher training in the area of Information Technology and Communication (ICT) for development of digital skills, methodological and educative. We understand that this is a crucial factor that can make a difference later to a more effective use of these new educational resources.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615866","Elementary school;multimedia educational games;digital resources","Manuals;Educational institutions;Software;Instruments;Games;Visualization;Multimedia communication","","","","8","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In node replication attack, an adversary creates many replicas after compromising and obtaining all the secret credentials of the captured node. These replicas are deployed by an adversary at strategic positions of the network in order to launch many insidious attacks within the sensor network. Node replication attack becomes more sophisticated and harmful when it appears in the form of masked replication attack. In masked replication attack all the neighbors of a clone node are compromised so that an adversary is able to shelter its clone node from being detected by the detection process.

However, the production of contents for such games, namely game scenarios with virtual worlds composed by cities and related elements (streets, buildings, furniture and so on) may require a laborious effort by multidisciplinary teams which lead to an expensive and time consuming solution. In order to avoid the development burden, procedural modeling techniques have been created and applied to generate virtual models of buildings and cities expeditiously with high degree of detail and realism. Nevertheless, most of the existing techniques use complex sets of rules to produce models without being aware of the architectonic structures and its relationships. Thereby, in order to simplify the generation process and rule dealing we propose, in this paper, an ontology-based procedural modeling methodology which integrates an ontological structure, describing city elements and the relationships between each other, and a combined set of procedural techniques to generate roman houses. The preliminary results point to a method capable of producing roman houses expeditiously, including the interiors and the exteriors.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615883","Procedural modeling system;Procedural modeling architecture;Game Content Generation;virtual representations;Computer-Aided Engineering;Computer-Aided Design (CAD)","Floors;Cities and towns;Solid modeling;Ontologies;Games;Shape","","","","17","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Negotiation is a form of interaction in which argumentation and trust can play a relevant role. Argumentation in a negotiation context has been defined as a way of interaction between trading parties that enables them to exchange information in order to explain their current position with the intention of increasing the chance of success. We propose an argumentation model based on past contractual data aiming at enriching electronic contracting processes. The idea behind this argumentation model is to prevent failures in future agreements. For that, an important step is to define a reasoning model that allows trading parties to point out some past contractual failures or explain such past failures. The purpose of this paper is then to investigate on how argumentation-based negotiation using historical contractual data may affect the outcome of a contracting process, taken as a comprehensive activity ranging from negotiation, monitoring and enactment assessment. This may be achieved through a careful selection of the partner with whom a contract is to be established, complemented with an argumentation-based negotiation of contract terms.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615893","electronic contracting processes;argumentation-based negotiation;argumentation system","Reliability;Contracts;Cognition;Proposals;Risk management;Context","","","","22","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The former is almost entirely based on computer vision, processing the raw image content from two ordinary and inexpensive “web-cams”, conveying further relevant information to the later, on a real-time basis. The proposed architecture was implemented with minimal interventions to an Ackermann-like vehicle which was originally designed for recreational purposes, serving as a “proof of concept” of the developed system.

Many game engines are available, and Unity3D is another example that presents some features such as rapid prototyping and an easy learning curve. The 3D space where action takes place is sometimes hard to map into a logical memory structure providing flexible access to that information. The problem of tracking players' path as well as their decisions in 3D environments arises when there is no previous knowledge of the scenario representation and the creation of a memory data structure poses an extra effort for the modeller. The proposed solution in this paper, albeit simple, is a straightforward way to track the location of the video game character and map it when he/she passes certain limits. This mechanism proved to represent a key step forward, addressing the important issue of tracking the decision-making process of players for future analysis and behaviour elicitation.","2166-0727","978-989-98434-0-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615896","serious games;behaviour analysis;decision-making modelling;3D character tracking","Games;Buildings;Three-dimensional displays;Engines;Solid modeling;Fires;Training","","2","","16","","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
