Often crude oil palm is marketed as fat or vegetable oil and has a large presence in the production of biodiesel. However, the production of crude oil palm is not exempt from controversy due to its environmental impact, thanks to the massive use of fertilizers and pesticides which call into question its sustainability over time. In this paper we proposes a fuzzy spatial model for the identification of palm units, from the integration of different vegetation indexes obtained from multispectral aerial images taken at low altitude. The integration of this vegetation indexes in a single mapgrid, allowed to identify in a large number of cases points with spatial energy concentration, which indicate the presence of oil palm unit. The results of the model will allow the localized treatment and characterization of oil palm units, generating a future alternative for the reduction of pesticides and fertilizers in this type of crops, ostensibly improving their environmental sustainability over time.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399144","Multispectral aerial images;Fuzzy maps;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Vegetation index","Vegetation mapping;Indexes;Vegetable oils;Biofuels;Biological system modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Agriculture","","1","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the models that allow migrating a Monolith to Microservices such as NGINX and IBM are analyzed. From these models, activities that allow such migration are carefully selected and identified. In order to implement and evaluate the activities proposed in those models, an application that initially does not have any structure at the design and coding level (using PHP programming language) is applied. Then, the application's coding language changes to Java and the classes and libraries are distributed into packages. Subsequently, as it is suggested in the models, services are identified and implemented using RESTful Web Services to finally implement the microservices using technologies such as Spring Boot, Eureka, and Zuul. In the migration process, the application under study is modified at the code and design level, including patterns such as Singleton, Façade, Strangler, Single Service per Host, Service Discovery, and API Gateway, which are used to evaluate performance as a quality attribute in each migration phase. In order to obtain the performance related metrics and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each migration phase, Apache JMeter as tool is used. This tool is set up to generate results regarding the use of resources such as CPU, memory, network, and database access. Finally, the results show scenarios of several concurrent users who access to consult records in the database that uses the aforementioned application in each migration phase.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399148","microservices;migration process;monolithic architecture;performance","Java;Web services;Logic gates;Encoding;Tools;Databases","","3","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this, the use of mathematical models based on specialized software (Matlab), determines the characteristics of the iris establishing criteria or patterns to determine the existence or not of Alzheimer's. For this we have: i) The Fourier Transform to normalize the image; ii) The Hough Transform to locate circles in an image. In addition some learning methods based on three multi-layer classifiers were used: ZeroR, Naïve Bayes and Multi-layer Perceptron. Finally, to distinguish between the different types of pathologies, several samples must be used and well identified, that is, the data must be consistent and with a good resolution to avoid influencing the results.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399151","","","","7","","13","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it depends on the peers' effectiveness in minimizing the intrinsic subjectivity to the process. Publishers try to achieve this through training and guides for reviewers. However, there is no consensus as to what the main criteria for a good review are, which results in poorly reasoned or vague reports that do not assist the editor in his decision nor the author in improvement of research. This project proposes a quality model for reviewing articles and a framework for their automatic classification through machine learning techniques. This proposal will be useful for: i) reviewers as a guideline for the preparation of the review report, ii) editors as an indicator of the quality of the received revisions, and iii) the authors as a model for self-evaluation of their research.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399153","quality model;peer review;machine learning","Computational modeling;Machine learning;Context modeling;Quality control;Process control;Training;Proposals","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, it aims to overcome the existing fragmented regulations and to modernise the principles of privacy in the EU. This regulation will come into force in May 2018, bringing along several challenges for citizens, companies and other private and public organisations. The protection of personal data is a fundamental right. The GDPR considers a `special category of personal data', which includes data regarding health, since this is sensitive data and is therefore subject to special conditions regarding treatment and access by third parties. This premise provides the focus of this research work, where the implementation of the GDPR in health clinics in Portugal is analysed. The results are discussed in light of the data collected in the survey and possible future works are identified.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399156","regulation (EU) 2016/679;general data protection regulation;personal data;health clinics","Data protection;Companies;Europe;Data processing;Security","","11","","9","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different researches have focused on specific applications, from their implementation to their automation. This project focuses on the determination of the cartographic precision of the orthophotomosaics generated from images obtained with UAV processed with the Agisoft® software. For this, a TAROT 680 PRO hexacopter was used (with GPS and INS included) to cover one hectare in the Moorlands of Chingaza, reserve area for Espeletia in the northeast of Bogotá (Colombia). A total of 167 photographs were acquired with a Canon A2300 camera. Five ground control points (GCP) were pre-signalized (GCP-P) and positioned with a Gr-5 receiver, in order to adjust the block of images. Due to the weather conditions not all GCP-P were captured in the images. To improve the adjustment of the project, three GCP were subsequently photo-identified (GCP-F) and positioned with the same type of equipment. Three projects were created, one in which GCP-P are included; the second including the GCP-P and GCP-F; and the third one in which GCP is not included. The first two projects correspond to the photogrammetric SfM process and the last corresponds to the direct georeferencing technique. The best results were obtained in the project that used only three GCP-P. Likewise, it was found that including the GCP-F in the adjustment of the block decreases the accuracy of the project, moving from a millimeter to a submetric precision; while not using GCP does not allow knowing the accuracy of the project with respect to the terrain.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399158","UAV;GCP;Photogrammetric process;moorland;espeletia","Global Positioning System;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Software;Three-dimensional displays;Biomedical imaging;Irrigation;Global navigation satellite system","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399181","healthcare;wearable;IoMT;Latin-America;adoption;barriers;challenges","Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Government;Security;Public healthcare;Real-time systems","","9","","38","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim was to understand how these systems work, and what advantages and disadvantages exist as well as to understand what awaits us in the future in the pharmaceutical field through the analysis of a real example. A personal interview was performed, in January 2018, with the owner and director of the Giro pharmacy; a session of passive observation was also realized. The aim was to learn about and observe the implementation of an automated system for the distribution of products from storage. The advantage of the system is that it allows for a more personalized service, as the employee does not need to be absent at any time during the delivery of the service. Innovation and its source was also a topic during the interview. International contacts and observing how firms function in other countries which are technologically more advanced (e.g. in Germany) were revealed as being important.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399190","Automation;technology;pharmacy;services automation","Pharmaceuticals;Economics;Industrial engineering;Face;Interviews;Automation;Artificial intelligence","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis of the data was based on the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining approach and for the treatment; we used the Anaconda IPython and Pandas. We developed the prediction with three models using R: Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The comparison of the performance of each of the methods shows that the model based on artificial neural networks has a greater accuracy in the prediction. These results need deepening the study to broaden the universe of the studied contexts. However, the simplicity in the application of the artificial neural networks model makes possible its use in computer applications without specific knowledge, giving a reliable instrument that allows the supporting decision-making by managers.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399191","algorithms;decision support;neural networks;time series","Artificial neural networks;Time series analysis;Smoothing methods;Data mining;Companies;Standards;Predictive models","","2","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The collective online shopping systems emerge in 2008, and may be considered as an effective promotion tool for business partners. In this context, the main goal of this research paper is to evaluate the perception of the business partners on the effectiveness of the last promotional campaign made using a collective online shopping system. Additionally, it is also analysed the consequents of effectiveness. The sample is comprised of 38 global business partners. The results lead to the following conclusions. First, the global effectiveness of the campaigns tends to be positive, mainly due to the non-financial effectiveness. Second, the global and non-financial effectiveness are predictors of their consequents, namely: word-of-mouth marketing, image, returning customers, customer retention, repeat the promotion and recommend promotion, while the financial effectiveness has no influence on any consequent. The existing literature on collective online shopping systems is still scarce. This research contributes to the literature by analysing the effectiveness and identifying the consequents of the effectiveness. From a business perspective, this study may help business partners to evaluate the impact on their business from promotional campaigns using collective online shopping sites and make a decision whether to join or not. From the site managers' perspective, this study may contribute to a better understanding of the perception held by the business partners on the business model's effectiveness and how to better meet their objectives.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399193","collective online shopping;effectiveness;discount site;business parteners","Companies;Industries;Globalization;Tools;Bibliographies","","","","24","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the huge amount of video information generated in real time, these surveillance centers are requiring more technology and intelligence to support human operators in many complex situations. There are important analyses that could be realized with this video-data: from criminalistics event detection to particular object recognition. One important tool is License Plate Recognition(LPR) that helps detecting vehicles, that could have been robbed. Although corporative solutions exist, these techniques require a lot of processing power and special located cameras, that not always could be afford by the local government. In this context, the proposed project is based on applying open-source LPR algorithms that runs on already existent surveillance cameras. These cameras are observing a complete scene (not just a line as it is commonly used), so LPR algorithms are rather slow, processing only 1 image per second. For this reason, the objective is to improve the performance combining parallel LPR processing and object tracking algorithms. This work describes the ongoing implementation, the techniques currently used for object tracking and LPR implementation, and exposes results regarding the efficiency of the solution.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399194","Image processing;license-plate recognition;Security;surveillance;open platform;digital government;component;formatting;style;styling;headings","Cameras;License plate recognition;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Streaming media;Surveillance;Security","","2","","15","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To diminish the negative impact caused by CO2 for global warming, its chemical transformation in Dimethyl Carbonate is a promising technology. Dimethyl Carbonate is a solvent with low toxicity and due to oxidative capacity can be used as fuel additive. In this work, the membrane reactor technology to improve the Dymethyl Carbonate production is explored from the perspective of modelling and simulation. As a result, a software-based model is implemented, in order to develop and couple different models for describing the membrane reactor. Simulation results showed that the membrane reactor, compared with conventional reactor, increase the reaction conversion and Dymethyl Carbonate production up to 67% and 78%, respectively. Finally, it can be seen that the solution obtained from software-based model allows to conclude that membrane reactor is a promising technology to mitigate CO2 emissions, allowing to achieve environmental sustainability.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399195","Sustainability;Greenhouse emission;green reagent;simulation;membrane reactor technology","Mathematical model;Inductors;Monte Carlo methods;Production;Numerical models;Sustainable development;Software","","","","43","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to USA (HIPAA) and EU legislation (GDPR) a patient has the right to see his/her clinical information and to know who has access to it, however, the process of obtaining all this related information is still time consuming and complicated. We aim to investigate the opinion of university students regarding the existence of a tool to verify whose healthcare providers access their health information. A web-based questionnaire was designed, 33404 university students were contacted and 589 answered it (1.8% response rate). 90.7% of participants recognize that a tool with those characteristics is important, and 71.5% of them agree to use that tool. In general, we can consider that although the vast majority of participants did not show great knowledge about available healthcare legislation (81%) and that about half of respondents do not know about the use of their data by other parties (52%), more than 90% consider important the existence of a tool to view who accesses their health information. We intend to continue research on this topic and design an access control tool that can empower patients to better control their privacy and rights so to address the gaps existing in the area.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399207","Personal health information;access control;patient access to records;patient empowerment;GDPR;HIPAA","Tools;Legislation;Clinical diagnosis;Sociology;Statistics;History","","","","10","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these environments, it is not an easy task to ensure the integrity of files handled by the federated clouds due to the fact that they are no longer physically in possession of their owner. Another consequence is the difficulty in protecting against file access from malicious entities. This paper deals with the problem of security in federated clouds, in particular on the BioNimbuZ platform. We propose the use of a file integrity policy based on file hashes, as well as a policy of confidentiality using encryption algorithms. Experiments carried out showed the effectiveness of this approach in verifying the correctness of files and that no-one other than the BioNimbuZ users have access to the information.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399212","Federated Cloud;BioNimbuZ;Cloud Securit;Integrity;Confidentiality","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;User interfaces;Task analysis;Encryption","","1","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently Logistics has been hampered by changes in external and internal environments, such as: delivery time, tracking and fleet management, customer opinion, supplier dependency, economic crisis. Considering the problems reported, as well as new market trends, new business models and technologies, Stepbox was developed. A logistics application of goods deliveries that offers services through shared economy. One of the proposals of the Stepbox is to serve as a channel of communication between the transport service applicants and the companies that provide the transport service. In order to provide innovation in this area, Stepbox offers several value propositions for both the freight forwarder and the companies that provide this type of service. For example: shared economy, smart routes, cargo tracking, delivery value suggestion, check-in, qualification of the product collection and delivery process(gamification), geo opportunity. Finally, the evaluation of the Stepbox proposal was carried out, together with the companies and possible clients of the freight transport service. Based on the results, it was identified that there is a strong indication that the new business model proposed by Stepbox suits the reality of companies operating in the logistics sector and solves the problems described in this paper.

In this context, the search and location for OER that match users' needs, including those with disabilities, is a key aspect to enhance their use. Currently, the results presented by the search engines do not contain relevant information to guide the users' exploration decision. Therefore, they must verify each resource until they find the right one, which demands an unnecessary effort. This situation becomes a critical issue if users are people with disabilities. The use of structured markup incorporated in the web content is a feasible strategy that can be used to improve the information displayed in the search results. This embedded marked is done through semantic annotations that can be processed by search engines to understand the meaning of the content fragments and provide users with enriched information in the search results. In this paper, we propose the use of a set of properties from Schema vocabulary to adequately describe OER and their accessibility properties, so that they can be used in microdata annotations.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399222","microdata;Schema;Open Educational Resources;OER;accessibility","Open Educational Resources;Search engines;Videos;Metadata;Visualization;Vocabulary;Computer science","","5","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The one presented in this work results from an identified need for a wine anti-counterfeiting scheme based on photos of cork stoppers already proposed in previous work. A photo of each cork stopper is used to register a wine bottle during the bottling process. To verify the genuineness of the product a user captures a photo of the stopper; that photo is then compared with the entirety of the database and all the relevant information is retrieved to the user. This approach can be a very slow process, becoming more time consuming with each increase of the database. Aiming to solve this problem, a CBIR system for wine anti-counterfeiting purposes based on cork stopper photos is presented. The feature extraction is achieved using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB), selecting the “best” keypoints (according to the Harris corner measure) per region. The regions are delimited by concentric circumferences calculated using the radius of the identified cork. The number of regions (NR), along with the number of selected keypoints (NP) per region, define the number of ORB descriptors needed for indexing the image in the database. To measure the similarity between the query image and the database a score is calculated based on NR and NP. Finally, the best N images according to the calculated score are retrieved. To evaluate the proposed approach 2 datasets (natural cork and agglomerate cork dataset) were created, totaling 1500 photos, and 4 different smartphone rear cameras were used. The recall results range from 75.0% to 99.5% in the natural dataset and from 86.0% to 99.0% in the agglomerate dataset. The average time for the retrieval process is about 9.74ms in a database populated with 100 photos. Critical analysis on the recall rate and its time tradeoff is also discussed. The results show that the proposed CBIR is adequate for its application - wine anti-counterfeiting.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399225","Content Based Image Retrieval;Image Retrieval;Query By Image Content;ORB;Cork;Wine Anti-counterfeiting","Image retrieval;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Shape;Histograms;Cameras","","1","","19","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this problem, we start from a database where the scores of some academic tasks (exercises, tests, exams) are stored for the corresponding students, considering a particular subject in the academic course. Since some scores for a particular student could be unknown (tasks not completed, submitted or evaluated), they can be predicted considering his behavior in the remaining tasks and the behavior of the other students for these unknown tasks. The prediction is performed by means of Matrix Factorization where the error (Root Mean Squared Error) is minimized by the Gradient Descent algorithm. Nevertheless, two problems arise: the best selection for the main parameters of the algorithms (learning rate and regularization factor) and the best selection for the number of latent factors. In this work, we propose a direct search of the optimal value of latent factors where the calculation for each number of latent factors is driven by a metaheuristic that select, at the same time, the optimal values of learning rate and regularization factor. Using this method, we can determine the best number of latent factors to be applied in further predictions for the similar databases.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399227","recommender systems;prediction;latent factors;matrix factorization;gradient descent;student performance","Task analysis;Recommender systems;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Training;Computers","","1","","13","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, in the area of software engineering, the performance and productivity of the work team have been identified as key success factors, with motivation being an essential factor in achieving this success. Therefore, there is an important growth of gamification strategies in the classroom as alternatives to increase the motivation and commitment of the work teams. However, the existing teaching strategies in software engineering omit certain details about how to structure a possible learning environment, such as the classroom. In this work a methodological structure is proposed to gamify an educational environment of software engineering. The objective of this proposal is to contribute to the decrease of causes of failure of software development projects within which is the lack of motivation and commitment as well as social and human factors that affect processes related to software engineering. An example of activities developed in a course of agility for software process improvement of the Universidad de Medellín is presented.

Nowadays it is common patient data to be dispersed by various systems. Modern systems are tending to adopt standards for modelling and communicating information, but this is not true for legacy systems, where the precision in terms of medical concepts are not standardized. Many times these systems are developed solutions to a specific needs of a medical service, without care for the terminology of clinical concepts representation or how it is structured in terms of semantic. Research relies heavily on the available data, and in context of Big Data analysis, the possibility of aggregating data from multiple, different and distributed sources in a meaningful and straightforward way is relevant. The main objective of this work is to propose an integration architecture that enables access to clinical data from different heterogeneous sources for research purposes. This paper presents an architecture based on the openEHR standard and a proof of concept of the mapping component that provides a tool for matching the attributes of openEHR Archetypes/Templates and fields of databases. With this approach all the data distributed in various repositories, legacy or openEHR are potentially available to the researcher, through the creation of AQL queries in order to get aggregated results for additional research activities.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399258","openEHR;EHR;interoperability;Big Data","Interoperability;Standards;Databases;Medical services;Aging;Semantics;Information systems","","2","","15","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With regard to transport systems, shared services enabled through technological solutions, especially in mobile space, have many benefits, such as mitigating traffic congestion and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, among others. In addition, with the population of large cities rising more than ever, citizens are becoming more sensitive to societal issues and other performance measures imposed by the new concept of smart cities. This work will study the literature with the objective of verifying the proposals and limitations of existing studies, prototypes and simulations, in order to provide a systematic evidence-based view of how the scientific community is applying MAS to leverage shared services for the implementation and feasibility of intelligent mobility solutions. In the course of the studies, we conclude that although some authors came to propose conceptual models and systems prototypes, the simulation component has been little explored and only synthetic data has been used. One of the reasons justified by the authors relates to the high costs of carrying out simulations. We did not find in the literature proposals that were effectively implemented and tested in the real world, but only prototypes and proposals of future developments.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399259","Multi-agent Systems;Shared Services;Mobility;Systematic Review","Multi-agent systems;Proposals;Systematics;Automobiles;Urban areas;Prototypes;Task analysis","","3","","40","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional teaching model of the subjects of initiation to programming is based on a set of tasks that usually result in a series of difficulties for the students which leads to an exhaustive monitoring by the teachers. It turns out that one of the main problems is that students often do not know if their work is correct (i.e. whether it works for a pre-defined data set) until it is reviewed and evaluated by the teacher. In this context, the Virtual Learning Environment becomes an attractive and interesting tool to help teach (and learn) programming. One of these tools is VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) a plugin of Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). We believe that the use of VPL may represent a paradigm shift for students, but also, and especially for teachers, because teachers will have to spend much more time upstream to prepare tasks and activities, test the environment and verify validation of the data. However, it is important to note that downstream teacher effort can significantly reduce because students do not need as much attention given that feedback on the quality and functionality of the code developed is immediate. This work is a part of a PhD in Research at Information Technology in the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and has been developed from the last 12 months. This Ph.D. research aims to analyze the VPL's integration potential in the programming teaching-learning process in higher education. It also aims to verify if, with VPL, it is possible to make student's learning more effective and autonomous, with less time and effort spent by teachers in assignments evaluation. In the present article, we will present a work-in-progress where we will show how VPL was introduced in a teaching-learning process supported on JAVA programming. The teaching method uses EduScrum methodology and is included in the course of Computer Engineering of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP / P.PORTO). The first results of this process will be presented.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399261","Teaching programming;Virtual Programming Lab;EduScrum;Real-time validation;automatic assessment;innovation","Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Tools;Servers;Java","","13","","16","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trust issues still exist - concerning e-commerce - and may indeed be pervasive in society. Brazil is currently undergoing a profound social and economic crisis, which it is trying to recover from. Indeed, the general lack of safety and security felt in Rio de Janeiro may even be a reason for the popularity of home and work deliveries - so that citizens will not have to travel - with travel constituting an additional risk which many may prefer to avoid.

Thus, the use of ICTs in education allowed the classrooms to expand and transcend the limits of space and time, a situation that although it has enormous advantages, it is necessary to provide pedagogical characteristics that make them more user-friendly both as a teacher and as a student. The need of professor as a guide, planner, mentor and evaluator in the learning process is indisputable, that is technological developments should support these tasks taking into account didactic aspects and not only technical ones. One of the challenges that emerge is the need to personalize learning according to the student's abilities and the characteristics of the object that is learned. This paper present a conceptual model of an intelligent system that uses the concept of learning paths based on portfolios. For this, the system takes into account both the different levels of assimilation of knowledge that a student can achieve as indicators of learning that give professor the guide of the progress in the learning process. In this way, a learning route is proposed that seeks to achieve the highest levels of learning possible for a particular student through the use of study materials adapted to each situation.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399270","learning path;e-learning;ontologies;learning personalization;portfolio;educational resources","Portfolios;Electronic learning;Electronic mail;Task analysis;Intelligent systems;Ontologies","","3","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reflect on such planning and to enable the implementation of IT governance, can be used the framework: COBIT 5. The COBIT 5 Goals Cascade translates these needs into customized, achievable and specific institutional objectives. Innovation Processes, such as Design Thinking, are typically used to stimulate creativity with a central focus on the stakeholders. This process can also be employed to assist in the implementation process. This paper reports a case study on the construction of the Goals Cascade of the Department of Information Technology from Federal Public Defender (STI/DPU) — Federal department of Brazil. During the process, instruments, maps and validation meetings were developed with the agency's managers. In less than a year, it was possible to structure the cascade which allied with the application of the techniques of Design Thinking allowed the revision of IT planning to reach an IT position in a more strategic way.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399277","COBIT 5 Goals Cascade;IT Governance;Design Thinking;IT Planning","Planning;Stakeholders;Instruments;Internet;Art;Technological innovation","","1","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So, when we talk about Cuscarias we can link the idea to a gossip local or a local to look for information and create knowledge. The system concept is based on technology to support citizen's co-creation providing information to a certain place - Cuscaria - whether it's a tourist spot or a coffee shop where people come together. Anyone can create a Cuscaria but need to contact the platform owners to mark the local with a beacon and with a theme. To access the information available for each Cuscaria, share experiences and emotions related to it, it is necessary to travel to the place where it is, to access its physical identifier (Beacon). Hence, anyone is able to find other people with the same interests and at the end of the day this system and concept promote in an effective way a place of acquaintance where is possible to achieve an interesting place to socialize. Also, it's possible to apply analytics to the platform to check trends and to support local strategies.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399278","co-creation;beacon;social information;analytics","Social network services;Information systems;Cultural differences;Tools;Global communication;Data mining;Object recognition","","2","","31","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its representation is considered to be increasingly important in decision-making and it is therefore necessary to guarantee access to spatial data in an easy, intuitive and fast way. The main problems of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are the large amount of information and performance of relational databases (RDBMS) in storage and in unstructured spatial data queries. This problem is significant, since the efficiency of accessing large amounts of spatial data over the Web today is important for conducting on-demand and real-time queries. This work presents a solution to improve efficiency in accessing large amounts of spatial data through the Web, by standardizing spatial data formats. This proposal, called Web GIS, uses the NoSQL MongoDB database engine and provides the spatial data in GeoJSON via a REST API. The results show that MongoDB has substantial advantages over relational databases in storing and querying large amounts of unstructured spatial data, since it supports the storage of data with different structures and also by the efficiency of its spatial operators.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399279","NoSQL;MongoDB;GeoJSON;GIS;Web;JavaScript;Node.js;AngularJS;Google Maps","Spatial databases;Google;Geographic information systems;Bills of materials;Relational databases;Random access memory;Decision making","","4","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the above, the design of an architecture of an automation system is proposed, which has two main functions: 1) control the level of liquid in the main storage tank, and 2) automate the process of packing the commercial drums by means of time-based dosing. The proposed system is based on an embedded system whose core is the ATMega32A microcontroller, float level sensors and an actuator system based on electrovalves. The performance of the prototype of the automation system was satisfactory since it avoided 100% of stockouts and overshoots of the liquid.

Consequently, monitoring of temperature and time is very important during the pasteurization process. If this monitoring is done manually, this negatively affects the quality of the product and the safety of the operating personnel of the process. Based on the previous problem, the purpose of this project is to design a low cost and portable architecture for temperature monitoring in dairy product silos. As results obtained, a functional prototype was developed and evaluated in the Lactofino industry. The prototype captures the data by means of an RTD sensor, conditions them, visualizes them and finally identifies and alerts the operator about the stage of the process in which the dairy product is located.

However an issues arises: aren't we putting technology ahead of the processes?. The truth is that I40 project are being implemented in different velocities in different companies and regions, even a small country like Portugal. Actually, despite of industries leaders agreed on the importance of the technological requalification (maybe pushed by the mediatism of the 4th industrial revolution), there is a lack of installed capability to embrace such projects. This concern is amplified when considering Portuguese sub regions. The impact of the I40 concept in the Portugues sub regions is the main motivation for this study on the Tâmega e Sousa region. The study combines the perspective/situation of the industry and the software houses. The way the I4.0 concept is being understood by the organisations in the Tâmega and Sousa region, and the degree of preparation for the phenomenon is discussed in this paper. The awareness of the lack of preparation of the organisations for the adoption of I40. strategies or I4.0 projects I4.0, together with the inability of the region's software houses to reverse this situation, led to the presentation of a practical set of recommendations.

During the aging process a person's physical and mental condition will degrade, imposing limitations on their life, which can have a great impact on their well-being. Although they are common to all humans, the consequences of aging can be aggravated by the decline in social relations and contact with family and friends. It is therefore of the utmost importance to maintain these relationships throughout life. In this sense, we intend to develop a system to support these people, allowing them to overcome their limitations, promoting and reinforcing the bonds between the user and the elements of his family and group of friends, using the technology. In this article we discuss the prototyping of a support system for the elderly to combat the lack of interaction between these individuals and their social group. With the use of prototyping it is intended a previous validation of the concept and functionalities of this system. The user is placed within the development process and, in this way, it is possible to evaluate the Human-Machine Interaction component and to detect possible problems so that they can be solved in a timely manner.

Therefore, currently doesn't exist a market without being related to software. In parallel, there has been developed a set of models and standards for quality assurance. This is the reason why in the software industry the resources focused on software quality assurance have been increased, this is reflected in the large number of quality models such as: CMMI, ISO/IEC standards among others, which contain practices that help organizations to achieve better levels in quality assurance. Besides, this has generated the development of tools to support the quality assurance. This paper presents a systematic review to identify the tools and practices that are implemented to ensure quality in the development of software products and services.

The data coming from these forums have been analyzed, with different techniques, and have allowed obtaining some very interesting conclusions. However, in recent academic years there is a clear trend of migration of collaborative work that previously occurred in the forums to social networks and mobiles. This poses a problem since these tools are not coordinated by the teaching teams.

In addition, the model applies multiple machine learning techniques such as decision tree C4.5, UCS, and Multilayer Neural Network. In this paper we use two forms for data classification, the first form will be to use the entire dataset with the 7 users, but the difference is that the model applies 5 commands or 16 commands. The model identifies the information of a user and the labeled as normal, otherwise, the user is labeled as an intruder (5 commands - 2 classes, 16 commands - 2 classes). The second form uses the dataset by sequential discrimination (discrimination in form of a decision tree). This methodology is used in the multiclass classification called one versus rest (OVR) (5 commands-OVR, 16 commands-OVR).

In that sense, sterilization autoclaves are used, and controlling both temperature and pressure, bacteria are killed. Nonetheless, in some cases the level of humidity in the internal atmosphere is highly relevant to guarantee the success of the process. This variable is controlled by knowing the steam quality, however, it is not monitored online, but sampling is performed a few times a year, so pertinent adjustments are carried out into the boiler when needed. This periodic maintenance does not guarantee that the process is effective. On the other hand, instruments for monitoring steam quality are expensive, and cannot be afforded by many hospitals. As a result, a cheaper determination of steam quality is carried out by using chemical instruments like test tubes, adding critical errors in the measurements. In this paper a cost-effective measuring and processing method by implementing Internet of Things — IoT-techniques is proposed, based on strangulation calorimeter. All the calculations are performed in a Single Board Computer which is connected to an IoT platform for logging data, supervise in pseudo real time and use statistical tools to inference or predict. As a result, the IoT node can achieve measurement errors up to 0.25% FS, against 5.6% FS of traditional method.

One of them intends to predict the course of a session by estimating if certain important objectives will be met for the development team. The other seeks to achieve a representation of the progression in time of the status of requirements considering the information that is captured during the sessions and how it becomes requirements. This proposal aims to be a practical tool for requirements engineers, whether they are new or experienced, in the management of these contextual factors and the management of the elicitation process.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399371","elicitation process model;contextual factors;context-based framework;software requi rements management","Software;Context modeling;Predictive models;Stakeholders;Computational modeling;Proposals;Tools","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems have been evolving towards a more active participation of the users making them part of the decisions and allowing a more active participation of the consultants during the test. The evolution of these methodologies is oriented towards the importance of taking into account the behavior of the user during the test session, making the evaluations more dynamic and more participatory. These sessions base their main objective on the results of the test and, therefore, on the pre-established and established behavior during the test. The study presented below is based on working the user experience as a discipline for evaluating user behavior, evoking the influence of emotions through the inclusion of gamification as a discipline to increase / improve experiences.

Each variable is treated as the most volatile component of a saturated binary system at a given temperature and pressure. The changes in each element of solution vector are made by using two new movement operators, the bubble point and the dew point.

Game authoring can be approached from two different perspectives. The first, where the educator creates a game from scratch, and a second one, where specific game components of an existing game can be configured (edited) by the teacher, abstracting the technical aspects of game development for non-programmer users. Nevertheless, whatever the perspective, the authoring games in an easy way is still a challenge, and even more, there is a lack of works considering educational aspects like Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), students' learning and playing styles, and learning mechanics. This work takes the second perspective and proposes an EGA platform that although embraces both the game and educational domains, puts the emphasis on the educational one. The platform provides educators with a mean for configuring educational games, and so adapt game's educational content to lessons pacing and students' learning needs. This platform is conceived generic enough to serve those educational games that are adapted to interact with it using a given protocol and communication language. In this paper, we present the architecture of the EGA platform, the communication protocol and the Authoring Description Language (ADL). We show the approach with an example of a maths game.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399394","educational game;authoring;learning;protocol","Games;Tools;Protocols;Education;Geometry;Software;Computer architecture","","1","","9","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are an important part of many evaluations. Currently, computer aided assessments are widely used for multiple choice questions, however, they do not have the ability to evaluate a student's knowledge more comprehensively, going beyond right or wrong, which is necessary for the job with the diagram. This research project presents an innovative approach for automatic evaluation of ERD. This approach proposes a solution to the challenge of encouraging students to perfect their solution: seeking, in addition to a response that returns the correct result, a note that approaches the ideal solution. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the student receives instant feedback during the practical diagramming activity, which allows the student to redo his solution for an optimal solution; (2) complete integration of ERD teaching concepts with examples of online diagrams; (3) monitoring the student's activities, i.e. how many examples were executed in each exercise, how many attempts were made. This research is a first step in building a fully assisted environment, for example, with automatic evaluation for ERD teaching, where the professor is freed from the arduous work of correcting diagrams and can perform more relevant pedagogical tasks. The method, based on machine learning techniques, uses structured query language (SQL) metrics extracted from the ERD and experts grade to create the prediction model. The solution can be adapted to other types of diagrams, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399401","Automatic evaluation;entity relationship diagram;machine learning;structured query language;metrics","Erbium;Measurement;Proposals;Education;Task analysis;Machine learning;Structured Query Language","","2","","35","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This process is aimed at optimizing costs and reducing environmental impact. Currently, different types of computational tools are used, from geo-referenced historical production maps to weather applications. In the case of spraying, it is essential that the producer can have real-time analysis tools in the same place, at the time of performing an application and thus be able to make decisions immediately, always considering the environmental impact. One of the most used tools in the evaluation of the quality of the spray is from the use of water-sensitive cards, which show with a reasonable degree of confidence the calibration state of the pulverizing machines. In this work the use of cell phones is proposed, to help in the process of calibration the spraying machines. For this purpose, the reading process of hydrosensitive cards is automated by means of computer vision technique. These devices allow the producer to immediately verify how a lot has been worked and recalibrate the machinery if necessary. The process followed and some robustness tests of this computational tool are presented.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399408","image processing;mobile devices;agricutlture technologies","Image color analysis;Tools;Spraying;Robustness;Calibration;Software;Smart phones","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of a child with severe communication problems, such as a child with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the family and colleague's interactions become considerably restrict and conditioned, which has a negative impact to their emotional, social and/or cognitive development. Thereby, it is fundamental to provide these children with the means to express themselves and to understand the individuals around them. In society, the verified existence of poor adapted material to children with communication disorders, in particular of adapted books in Communication Pictographic Symbols (CPS), and these can be materials that facilitate access to information by these children. The developed investigation is centred at the development of teaching resources, more specifically adapted books with CPS symbols, and their application along with children with ASD. It has had the main goal of verifying if these resources have eased the inclusion of these children in reading activities, as well as if it promotes a further development of the communicative skills alongside these children and their peers, in comparison with the original versions of the same books. The adopted methodology consisted in a qualitative research method, in favour of a case study and action-research approach, in an exploratory and descriptive research method. The investigation was based on fieldwork, which involved two children and the adapted books, developed in the scope of the research. During the research process, there were held practical sessions along with the participating children, where the corresponding fieldnotes were gathered. Subsequently, the special education teachers and class directors, from the respective children, were interviewed. After the data collection, process and analysis we concluded that the adapted books have been structurers and enablers of the communication, when facing the original versions of the books. The children's behaviour and communicational reaction towards the adapted books was of increased participation and dynamics when compared with the reaction towards the original versions of the books, promoting an equal the inclusion of the children with ASD in the reading activities.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399410","augmentative and alternative communication;inclusion;adapted book;autism spectrum disorder","Face;Autism;Education;Surges;Software;Data collection;Variable speed drives","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a solution designated Color Algorithm for Flame Exposure (CAFE), which significantly improves an existing method (cf. Forest Fire Detection Index - FFDI) in flame detection, based on daylight images, in mixed Mediterranean landscape, containing vegetation, buildings, burning areas, land, etc. The CAFE approach, presented, adds a parameterizable transformation of the image into the Lab color space. This approach was tested in four distinct scenarios, significantly reducing false positives and maintaining an equivalent level of false negatives when compared to the FFDI approach.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399412","flame detection;color index;image surveillance;drone;real-time","Fires;Irrigation;Image color analysis;Drones;Indexes;Image segmentation;Forestry","","1","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementation developed a model based on a decision tree that proposes the classification of pregnant women into ten groups based on six basic variables. After implantation, the cesarean section rates was observed between 2016 and 2017. In this period, there were 4,155 deliveries (37.6% cesarean sections). The evolution of cesarean section rates followed a growth trend, as well as the proportion of cesareans section between groups classified as 1 to 4, groups of pregnant women where cesarean sections are very preventable. In the two years it was observed that the SADC had no impact on the reduction of cesarean rates. It was concluded that in health services, work processes need to be articulated with timely decision-making strategies, so that the execution of actions can promote the qualification of services and improve the quality of patient care.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399413","Cesarean Section;Birth;Decision Support Systems;Health Care;Electronic Health Records","Hospitals;Pediatrics;Decision support systems;Gynecology;Market research;Pregnancy;Software","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This may significantly decrease the quality of the reached conclusions. In an effort to solve this problem, we present PhysioDataBase, a free online repository dedicated to physiologic signals and data exchange. PhysioDataBase allows researchers to create and share with the scientific community physiological signal files, and relevant complementary information, such as sociodemographic data, medication, or clinical history.

Although it is interesting to compare personal achievements against similar works from other researchers, in many ocassions it is hard to replicate exactly the same conditions, because papers do not reflect all the variables of the context. To mitigate this problem, some standard systems have been created for researchers to unify this step in their works. One example of this is the bxb (beat-by-beat) tool from PhysioNet's PhysioToolkit, developed to compare results in beat detection. Delineation is an important part inside Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic systems, because it is necessary to properly identify waves inside the beats. Besides the position of each wave into the signal, onset and offset positions for a wave are also needed. The more precise these positions are, the better the diagnostic is. But unlike the case of the beat detection, there are no generic tools for delineation evaluation, and papers that deepen in this subject in most cases do not explain clearly how they get their results, or directly asked an expert to supervise the outcome of their systems. Because of this, the main purpose of the present work is to introduce an evaluation tool, named wxw, to assess wave delineation for a computer-aided ECG diagnostic system.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399420","electrocardiogram;heart beat detection;evaluation tool;wave delineation","Tools;Electrocardiography;Databases;Task analysis;Standards;Heart beat","","","","17","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, we intend to understand which are the factors that affect or hinder the open source software adoption. To achieve these goals, it was used a survey where it was possible to collect 64 answers. It was verified that the most used software is the proprietary software and that 43% of the respondents are in the first level of open source software assimilation. Additionally, it was verified that the external environment is the macro factor which positively affects the adoption of open source software in auditing.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399428","software open source;proprietary software;audit;software open source adoption","Open source software;Instruments;Spreadsheet programs;Context modeling;Business;Tools","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

External audits aim to obtain relevant and sufficient evidence that points to high, but not absolute, assurances that the financial statements are free from fraud or material misstatement. On the other hand, the main goal of internal auditing is to identify the risk of fraud by developing strategies that provide the capacity to prevent it and anticipate control needs. Organizations nowadays generate and store more information in electronic format. Because there are large amounts of data, the transactions that are subject of abuse are concealed and harder to detect by traditional means. Thus, analytical methods become increasingly fundamental in identifying and uncovering potential evidence of fraud.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399429","Fraud;Audit;Data Analysis;Analytical Methods;Anomaly Detection","Software;Organizations;Monitoring;Visualization;Structured Query Language;Electric potential","","1","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The small companies can manipulate the earnings for example for reducing the income taxes to pay or to finance as also reducing the interest rate of those finance. The small companies are an important part of businesses, either in terms of employees and number. The voluntary audit is not very studied subject. The results suggest that the voluntary adoption of audit do not reduce the earnings management, and thus do not increase the earnings quality.

In order to determine the behavior that the Ecuadorian press has adopted facing these new digital media, the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the two newspapers chosen for this research were analyzed. Additionally, interviews made to the main representatives of these journals and the results of a survey made to 389 people were studied. Based on the data obtained, it is evident that, despite the large benefits that social networks present, the media analyzed do not take full advantage of the resources that these tools offer to digital journalism. Interactivity with users, such as the undeniable utility of social media, is unequal in the two newspapers studied, with a higher participation rate in El Comercio.

With this objective, a mixed methodology is proposed that uses the descriptive method through the quantification and qualification of the audiovisual aspects implemented by community radios. Based on this analysis, it is observed that although the media analyzed use audiovisual tools, not all of them present an adequate communication management of them, as well as media that do not take advantage of the audiovisual potential offered by Facebook. With this, it is concluded that the transition from analogue community media to the virtual world still requires a great work of transformation towards multimedia and the understanding of the characteristics of social networks and digital communication.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399454","community radio;facebook;convergence;social networks;multimedia;streaming","Facebook;Multimedia communication;Streaming media;Media;Internet;Tools;Visualization","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATT) are examples of tools used for this purpose, but many other software programs are used to support audits. Considering this growing use of computer tools to support auditing, this study aims to identify the most used tools in the context of the internal audit in Portuguese companies, and to evaluate the factors that may influence the use of those tools. This research, through an inquiry, concludes that internal auditors mostly use generic rather than specific tools in their audit work. The use of specific computer tools to support auditing is influenced by the size of the workplace, more specifically by the size of the audit department. Other factors that also influence the use of these computerized techniques are the experience in auditing and the existence of a certified internal auditor in the workplace.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399455","audit;CAATT;computer tools;internal audit;Portuguese companies","Tools;Software;Companies;Data analysis;Qualifications;Data mining","","6","","21","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is essential to carry out research on internal control in ERP contexts so that control measures may accompany the rapid development of those systems and the increase of their complexity so that the risks associated to their use may be reduced. This paper presents a bibliometric study on internal control in ERP systems and concludes that research on this topic is still scarce. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the level of research maturity is still very low because the number of publications regarding this subject is extremely small when compared to the number of publications in each of the core topics (internal control and ERP) individually.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399456","internal control;enterprise resource planning;ERP;bibliometry;research","Process control;Information technology;Enterprise resource planning;Control systems;Companies","","2","","13","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

What is cardinal, what is essential, is located in the field of perception. That is, “to be perceived” is what is substantial. And, besides, it should be considered that perception would turn vacuous and would dilute itself in the instant's own dimension that rules the essence of the digital society, unless it is capable to implicate the receiver in a singularized relationship in accordance with continuity, while this is sustained by the latter devoting its time. This way, the binomial attention-time necessarily becomes indissoluble. This new approach to the communicative connection between sender-receiver has triggered an important acceleration of the expansive process of content reformulation, the formats encapsulating them, and the media circulating them. Just arriving plays the role of what is contingent. What is nuclear is to “remain,” sustaining that singular, individualized dialogue that is inherent to the collectivization of the digital presence due to the successive incorporation of communicative action-reaction in the melting pot of incessant feedback. The struggle between senders to reach their “desired” receivers - united under the concept of public - now does not have the final purpose of “arriving,” reaching them, and exposing themselves to them. Now, it is all about capturing their attention and withholding it to receive retribution from them in time, which is possible to be monetized. What is difficult is to capture attention in the more and more complex digital world. That is why information and communication technologies direct their development to a more exhaustive knowledge of the “digital subject”, where the so-called “big data” plays an essential role to be able to predict and anticipate certain individual behaviours and have a positive bearing on “capturing” their attention and generating a higher degree of engagement. This is the foundation of the emerging content marketing.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399463","attention economy;big data;content marketing;engagement","Big Data;Receivers;Liquids;Acceleration;Media;Information and communication technology;Internet","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All this with Article 20 of the Spanish Constitution and the debate on the limits of the freedom of expression in the background, in the midst of a cross-match between the so-called constitutionalist and independence political parties, between appeals to the Central Electoral Board (JEC) and accusations about manipulation by different television channels. In this context, the role of electoral debates in television becomes especially important, as a tool for achieving a better-formed public opinion, increasing the quality of public debate-citizen- and by extension the improvement of participation and democratic quality. The research presented here analyzes, in particular, the advertising and actions of self-promotion issued by the television operators (TVE, La Sexta and TV3) that organized debates among the candidates of the main political parties that attended the mentioned elections, in order to know the frame of reference and informative treatment offered by this TV's about the same event in function of three variables: the public or private nature of the medium, the territorial scope of them and the editorial line.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399469","Electoral debates;TV;self-promotion;advertising;Catalonia","Irrigation;TV;Portals;Voting;IEEE Constitution;Advertising","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As there is no certifiable standard for integrated management systems, this study seeks to measure the sensitivity of companies to a single certifiable standard for integrated quality and environment and safety management systems (SIGQAS). An empirical study, considering an exploratory analysis based on a survey methodology applied in industrial companies of the central region of Portugal, has been conducted, with, at least, the certified Quality Management System. According to the data analyses, a large number of companies (59%) consider that the existence of a single certifiable standard for SIGQAS would facilitate their implementation. However, the differences between opinions, are not statistically significant, wherefore the need for an integrative standard, is not clearly taking into account by the companies. On the other hand, it is evident to companies that consider the existence of the only certifiable standard, their motivation for the certification of SIGQAS. In view of this situation, is clear the challenge that auditing faces as monitoring function, while an integrated part of the system, which can also contribute to the resources optimization and continuous improvement. However, it is important to continue the research, in particular as regards the extension of the sample.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399471","certification;integrated system;internal auditing","Companies;Standards;Monitoring;Face;Certification;Surges","","","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In reality, this phase is vital to ensure the timeliness, adaptability and quality of the information available to end users. However, despite the recognized importance attributed to the optimization of ETL, it is rare to find Information Technology (IT) teams that develop metrics and indicators that allow the factual monitoring of their performance. In line with the saying “the shoemaker's son always goes barefoot”, those responsible for the development of ETL processes often base their optimization exclusively on previous experiences and professional sensitivity. In this context, the objective of this article is to study the concept of BI for BI, analyze its added value in the optimization of ETL processes and indicate possible monitoring indicators.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399473","ETL;business intelligence;monitoring;dashboard","Monitoring;Business intelligence;Servers;Surges;Software;Optimization;Bills of materials","","2","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATTs) have an important part in this process, since those methodologies can involve sophisticated statistical analysis and can be time consuming. For audit time series, CaseWare IDEA can be used to compute point forecasts, meaning that a single value is produced for each forecast. Even though the practical usefulness of this type of forecast is undisputed, the uncertainty in the forecasts is not expressed. To overcome this issue, a point forecast should be complemented with its prediction intervals. The R Project software is an interesting statistical tool to consider for this purpose, as it provides quick accurate analysis in a reproducible way. This paper describes how prediction intervals based on regression analysis can be computed in R Project software, for audit series with trend and/or seasonality.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399474","audit data analytics;time series;forecasting;prediction interval;CaseWare IDEA;R Project software","Market research;Time series analysis;Software;Forecasting;Heating systems;Predictive models;Databases","","1","","17","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
