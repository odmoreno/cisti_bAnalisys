In the first instance it is important to understand the impact that the Internet and the digital world have on marketing in order to understand how the email marketing is important today and what its usefulness. In this study it was applied questionnaires to e-mail users in order to understand what, for the user / consumer, it is more important to receive through advertising e-mails. This study also seeks to understand what factors the user / consumer considers most relevant to have the body of advertising e-mail to open and read. After statistical processing of data, it was concluded that the factor that most influences the opening of the e-mail are the promotions and campaigns.",

This fact pushes the educative community toward the challenge of designing learning methodologies which enables to understand of the chaotic phenomenon. In this paper we propose an educative software application, easily accessible for medium level undergraduates with some knowledge of the foundations of Chaos Theory. This MATLAB application (called CAOS SUITE) allows students to simulate the system's temporal evolution, to see its correspondence in the phase space, to analyze the convergence problems in the Lyapunov's exponents calculation, and to obtain the complexity degree of the studied system by means of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension. The dynamical systems analyzed cover from basics type Jerk to complex systems with Hyperchaos.",

    "abstract": "The Museum of the Person (Museu da Pessoa, MP) is a virtual museum aimed at exhibiting life stories of common people. Its assets are composed of several interviews involving people whose stories we want to perpetuate. So the museum holds an heterogeneous collection of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) documents that constitute the working repository. The main idea is to extract automatically the information included in the repository in order to build the web pages that realize the museum's exhibition rooms. This project started by creating a specific ontology (OntoMP) for the knowledge repository of MP. That ontology is intended to allow a conceptual navigation over the available information. We will adopt the standard for museum ontologies CIDOC-CRM (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model) refined with FOAF to represent OntoMP. The objective of this paper is to discuss different architectural approaches to build a system that will create the virtual rooms from the XML repository to enable visitors to lookup individual life stories and also intercross information among them. The first architecture is based on a TripleStore and uses SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) technology to extract the information, while the second proposal is based on a Relational Database and uses CaVa Generator to query the repository and build the exhibition spaces.",

    "abstract": "E-commerce promotes economic growth by enabling online shops to compete within a global market scenario. There are critical success factors that permit to distinguish a good business on the Internet and this knowledge may allow reaching an important competitive advantage for business sustainability. As many disciplines are involved, when determining critical success factors, e-commerce requires an effective coordination and integration in a collaborative way. In e-commerce, as well as in any other ecosystem, the breaking down of some integrating elements may provoke a collapse on the whole system. The various stakeholders involved in a given business should, therefore, be involved and work together to achieve a high quality product that fully satisfies the end customer's needs and wishes. To meet the above requirement, this paper proposes a multi-perspective critical success factors (MPCSF) model for online shopping.",

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) corroborates the shared management vision provided by the cloud computing paradigm, which can assist with related security issues. The necessity to address security requirements in cloud computing SLAs is considered important for both providers and consumers, along with the tools and mechanisms necessary to deal with these requirements. These issues are current research challenges; therefore, this paper aims at proposing a framework to orchestrate the management of cloud services based on security requirements defined by the SLA in an automated manner during its entire lifecycle. In addition, mechanisms to support the phases of the SLA lifecycle are proposed as a part of the framework. also the preliminary validation of the proposed framework. Finally, it is presented the integration of the framework with a cloud solution and in what manner the SLA lifecycle is supported by the framework.",

Thus, the indoor air quality is undoubtedly a key factor to be controlled to ensure the health and comfort of the occupants. Most of the air quality monitoring systems on the market are very expensive and only allow to collect random samples. This paper describes iAQ, a monitoring system that uses a low cost wireless sensor network, to collect indoor air quality information. This system was developed using Arduino, XBee modules and micro sensors, for storage and availability of monitoring data in real-time. This data can be accessed through a Web portal and through a Android mobile application requiring only an internet connection. Five sensors are used for the acquisition of environmental parameters (air temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and luminosity). Other sensors can be added to monitor specific pollutants. The results show that the indoor air quality may be, in some cases, quite different than expected values. The proposed system can provide effective indoor air quality assessment in order to avoid the risk of exposure to pollutant sources.",

    "abstract": "Software quality is a critical aspect in the development process of products for several economic sectors (ie. industry, services, agricultural, etc.). CMMI, ISO standards, Personal Software Process (PSP), and Team Software Process (TSP) are examples of approaches for improving software quality. Teaching such approaches is a challenge because of the amount of concepts, practices, and statistics required for their adoption, generating problems related with low motivation and poor performance in students or professionals in training. In the literature several approaches for solving these problems are presented, some of them incorporating active learning strategies like case method, simulation, and gamification. In this paper we propose a method for facilitating the design of teaching strategies based on gamification principles, looking for increasing the student motivation in their learning process. As a way to evaluate the proposed method, a pilot study case for teaching subjects related to software design in the context of PSP is presented.",

    "abstract": "The production of medical imaging data has grown tremendously in the last decades. The proliferation of digital acquisition equipment has enabled even small institutions to produce considerable amounts of studies. Furthermore, the general trend for new imaging modalities is to produce more data per examinations. As a result, the design and implementation of tomorrow's storage and communication systems must deal with Big Data issues. Moreover, new realities such as the outsourcing of medical imaging infrastructures to the Cloud impose additional pressure on these systems. The research on technologies for coping with Big Data issues on large scale medical imaging environments is still in its early stages. This is mostly due to the difficulty of implementing and validating new technological approaches in real environments, without interfering with clinical practice. Therefore, it is crucial to create test bed environments for research purposes. This article proposes a methodology for creating simulated Big Data repositories. The system is able to use a real world repository to collect data from a representative time window and expand it according to research needs. In addition, the solution provides anonymization tools and allows exporting two types of simulated data: a structured file repository containing DICOM objects and a statistical summary of the archive content based on its characteristics, such as the number of produced studies per day, their modality and their associated data volumes.",

    "abstract": "In the 2000's, the Internet became the preferred mean for the citizens to communicate. The YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, i.e., the social networks in general appeared together with the Web 2.0, which allows an extraordinary interaction between citizens and the democratic institutions. The trade unions constantly fight governments' decisions, especially in periods of crisis like the one that the world, Europe and, in particular, Portugal are facing. In this regard, the use of e-participation platforms is expected to strengthen the relationship between trade unions and the education community. This paper reports the research about the planning and driving of a series of experiments of online public consultation, launched by teachers' trade unions. These experiments are compared with those of other countries, such as Australia, United Kingdom and United States of America. A quantitative analysis of the results regarding hits, subscriptions, and response rates is presented, and it is compared with the 90-9-1 rule, the ASCU model and data from government agencies. The experiments performed used the Liberopinion, an online platform that supports bidirectional asynchronous communication. A better understanding of the benefits of these collaborative environments is expected by promoting quality of interaction between actors.",

Combining these two approaches into a multi-model environment may help to include best practices from both frameworks, considering project management key factors. However, the implementation of a multi-model environment is complex due to the integration of best practices from different sources. Such complexity increases when the sources have different nature. This paper defines a set of heuristics and its graphical representation for using a multi-model catalogue for software project management. The objective is to homologate best practices of both agile and traditional frameworks in a multi-model environment, using a pilot validation of the proposal for the requirement management process in SCRUM and CMMI-DEV 1.3. Such validation allowed us to analyze the catalogue structure behavior and the heuristics. It also provided us an example of a multi-model environment for agile and traditional frameworks.",

In this paper we explore the use of the time series data mining technique for the sales prediction of individual products of a pharmaceutical distribution company in Portugal. Through data mining techniques, the historical data of product sales are analyzed to detect patterns and make predictions based on the experience contained in the data. The results obtained with the technique as well as with the proposed method suggest that the performed modelling may be considered appropriate for the short term product sales prediction.",

The goal of business process mapping is to understand, improve and organize the activities of the process to ensure efficient and correct implementation. Quality in business process modeling can decisively influence the software quality. Internal quality analysis is made in-house, for the development process, while external quality analysis is made for the final product and satisfaction of the end consumer. Quality assurance comes from quality attributes verified with checklists in iterative cycles. Then, process mapping contributes both to producing consistent artifacts to better communications within the project. This article presents a methodology for quality assurance of process modeling that can be applied for the development of large computer systems. The methodology was used in a complex case study, with the mapping of business processes using BPMN, to develop a system for human resources management within the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management (MPOG) in Brazil.",

The self-defense is a field which is more and more necessary in our life. During our research, we tried to find out if it is possible to connect information technologies with learning of self-defense for more effective results. We used VICON system for visualization of body motion and in the following steps we looked for differences between untrained and trained subjects. The result was a detection of significant differences and mistakes in self-defense techniques. In the future we will implement this finding to the training.",

    "abstract": "The XXI century companies are increasingly interested on in the development of complex processes on bioengineering and health sciences. In this context, it is essential for undergraduate and graduate students to understand the behavior of complex phenomena. However, nowadays, academic programs are limited to the study of linear systems and first-order approximations; while companies use sophisticated software applications applied to complex systems, whose results have to be interpreted. In order to bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a learning methodology based on working with simulation programs of non-linear dynamical systems and chaos to treat complexity, applied to bioengineering. In particular, in this work we make a software application to analyzing three interesting studies in the context of biological systems: a nonlinear electrical oscillator that is a paradigm of self-sustained oscillations, a heartbeat model based on this oscillator, and the Brusselator system to model autocatalytic biochemical reactions. As a result, we are proving how it is possible, with this application, to analyze the complex behavior and the anomalies in biological systems with this methodology. By means of the proposed software applications in this paper, we analyze and facilitate the learning involving models closer to the real world.",

Recent research results have shown that constant assessment positively encourages this type of education, generating satisfaction in users of these technologies. The tool most widely used in this context for assessment are objective tests, particularly the tests single or multiple choice. But these are not sufficient to evaluate the different knowledge levels that arise as targets (like the levels in Bloom's taxonomy). Given this, it is necessary to have tools that allow for different types of assessment. This paper presents a proposal to implement portfolios assessment in e-learning environments. It consists of a semantic model that describes a tool to the creation, administration and performance of portfolios.",

This new interaction in social media brings daily consequences for business. Situations that were contained, now can assume a large scale and damage institutions' image and reputation. Recently there have been a commitment of the companies to invest in tools to monitor social media so that potential crises can be prevent. Health institutions, such as hospitals, have not yet showed concern with this problem. Many of them do not have communication staff, have limited resources and many of the executive directors in hospitals are not aware that social media monitoring is needed.

    "abstract": "Computational Thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation and analysis skills for problem solving, thus becoming a set of fundamental skills for the 21st century. Many initiatives have emerged to promote early development of CT skills. However, to date, there are no studies in which CT is developed in minority groups, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders. An analysis of the artifacts produced by the participants of a pilot offering of the workshop was performed using a rubric for CT skills acquisition. The results showed that the participants, all of them with high-functioning autism and no previous experience with programming, acquired intermediate level skills related to CT.",

Although the calendar tends to have a personal connotation, there are many families who use it as the best way to manage their activities and organize family time, sharing by all the same calendar. Reconcile all events in one place shared without privacy commitment of each one, it becomes a difficult task. One option is to use a second calendar that puts the events that should not be shared within the family. However, this solution becomes slow for all events consultation. Thus, the proposed solution is the creation of a calendar, with three types of data display, to ensure that one can use it without compromising the privacy of each element. A web platform with a calendar and tasks to support these three types of exhibition was created and tested by families in their day to day over a period of time. The responses allowed to conclude that a calendar is a great memory aid as more than 80% use it to this end. The results obtained showed the needs that a user has when using a calendar as well as the willingness to use it in the family.",

    "abstract": "This work aimed developing a multimodal interaction platform of robotic devices in a simulated environment. It was developed and implemented a system that allow a user to interact with an Intelligent Wheelchair (IW) allowing to test the robot driving control through an adaptive multimodal interface. Furthermore, it was implemented and tested a robot representing a ramp for Paralympic sport “Boccia”. This Intelligent Robotic Ramp (IRR) will allow practitioners with various physical and psychological disorders, to practice this sport in a more autonomous way. This IRR will have greater emphasis on the BC3 category, where its practitioners have a very high level of dependency, having the need to resort to his coach and a launch pad (ramp) in order to play the game.",

However, ensuring basic requirements such as integrity, availability, and privacy in a cloud infrastructure provided by unreliable third parties is a challenge, especially when the loss or leakage of information can bring significant damage, either due to legal or business reasons. Considering this challenge, this paper proposes a protocol that allows, through an independent verifier, a regular and reliable monitoring of the data stored in the cloud using computational trust.",

However, it is necessary to select appropriate measurement models that offer simple and useful results for the component selection process. The objective of this work is to define an appropriate set of metrics from a set of options that offer similar functionality. The research was developed based on ISO 9126-1: 2000 analyzing the usability features and sub-features and bibliographic review of the main research questions.

However, traffic simulators are often strictly two-dimensional and do not offer the capability of modelling urban networks taking elevation into account. In particular, SUMO - Simulation of Urban Mobility, an often used microscopic traffic simulation platform, relies on urban networks previously modelled with elevation data in order to provide access to this information during simulations. This work intends on tackling the problem of how to add this elevation data to urban network models - in particular for the case of the Porto urban network, in Portugal. With this goal in mind, a comparison between different altitude information retrieval approaches is made and a simple tool to annotate network models with altitude data is proposed. This paper starts by describing the methodological approach followed to develop the work, then describing and analysing its main findings. This description includes an in-depth explanation of the proposed tool. Lastly, this paper reviews some related work to this subject.",

This paper proposes to apply this process a governamental institution, by proposing a standardized methodology of requirements management, adapted to the needs of the institution, to improve productivity and quality. Therefore we analysed the traditional method of software-development, with emphasis on the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and agile methods such as Scaled Agile Framework process (SAFe), in order to propose a hybrid method for requirements management. Interviews, technical applications to establish the context, literature searches on documents, standards and best practices were held in order to validate the hybrid approach of the proposed methodology that was applied to a case study.",

An illustration of scientific computing over the Web is described, based on remote servers in parallel, as fits separable time consuming tasks. The illustrative problem chosen was the probabilistic behaviour of the perimeter of random polygons inscribed in a circle, as: it is simple to state; its Monte Carlo resolution suits the computing considered; and each polygon to be simulated (with 3, 4, etc., sides) can be assigned to each server, here two servers. Our objectives are: to signal the adequacy of the Web for scientific computing; and to show the use of parallel, possibly heterogeneous remote servers. The problem can be freely solved on the authors' webpage. We think the benefits of scientific computing over the Web, despite the ubiquity of this environment, have lagged behind most other uses.",

In some cases, slowness is the major problem, but in extreme situations, simulation can abort before completion. In addition, to analyze and extract results from large simulation models can be quite complex. An alternative way to deal with these problems is to fragment large CPN models into smaller nets and conceive models as distributed systems (DS). In this work, we present the Distributed Fusion Places (DFP), one new node to compose distributed CPN, which support communication and interaction between geographically dispersed subnets, which together make up a larger, unique and coherent model. In this way, different processes execute subparts of a single model, processing part of the computational effort needed to simulate the global model. Results obtained from distinct parts of the model can be analyzed individually or consolidated to represent the overall system operation. To demonstrate and validate this approach, we have introduced CacheSIM, a simulator conceived to analyze file admission and substitution policies in systems with distributed caches.",

The system is able to collect, store, process and display electrical and meteorological parameters that are crucial when monitoring PV facilities. The identification of failures in the PV system and the elaboration of performance analysis of such facilities are other important characteristics of the developed system. The access to the information about the monitored facilities is achieved by using a web application, which was developed with a focus on the mobile devices.

    "abstract": "In this paper we review the features of the HyFlex experience and study at the Technical University of Loja (UTPL) in its implementation. The HyFlex model is accepted as an innovative proposal that gives courses Blended Learning new features of flexibility and adaptation with respect to the availability of space and time of the students as well as their way of learning. Our research was mainly oriented towards two issues: the description of the model and case study. These aspects will conclude on an assessment of strengths and weaknesses of HyFlex and strategies for its implementation. Thus, the case study of the UTPL has been positive, but some obstacles have been identified for implementation, mainly related to teacher training. There is little research on HyFlex model but further investigation of these practices is necessary to have sufficient information to assess the relevance of its application in the global context.",

    "abstract": "Radiographic densitometry is a technique that allows us to evaluate bone density, using as reference an inert material, such as aluminum. Those techniques allow for the support of the diagnosis of diseases and bone abnormalities such as osteoporosis. To increase the technical precision, some authors proposed the use of mathematical equations, as the minimum square method, LaPlace's theorem and the Sarrus rule, which will result in a better fit of the characteristic absorption curve to X-rays through the study object. The use of technologies such as Java and MySql - open source - allows the development of advanced algorithms, able to analyze and process digital or scanned radiographic images and calculate density values close to the study object values. Currently many paid solutions are supported to perform radiographic densitometry. The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm that makes it possible to measure bone density from the X-ray densitometry. To test the software, a number of test will be conducted using both inert material and bone materials. It is expected that with the implementation of advanced algorithms can provide better precision and accuracy, once applications using the polynomial 3rd degree demonstrated excellent accuracy, but a bad correctness in some steps cases.",

Technology managers must learn how to manage those changes associated with the introduction of new systems and technical innovations. Change management, a relatively new discipline, offers new perspectives to address the costs and risks associated with change processes. It analyzes critical management issues such as the role of leadership, coordination, process design, and implementation strategies.

The construction of a simulator related with the Portuguese Autonomous Driving Competition using Gazebo as 3D simulator and Robotics Operating System (ROS) as a middleware connection to promote, attract, and enthusiasm university students to the mobile robotics challenges is presented. The proposed simulator focus on the autonomous driving competition task, such as semaphore recognition, localization, and motion control. An evaluation of the simulator is also performed, leading to an absolute error of 5.11% and a relative error of 2.76% on best case scenarios relating to the odometry tests and an accuracy of 99.37% regarding to the semaphore recognition tests performed.",

Such investigations reveal indicators that contribute to innovative management of Territorie, which it is characterized as a biodiverse natural heritage. Due to heterogeneity of the distribution of rainfall and other weather variables in in that region suggest the need to use radar systems LAWR (Local Area Weather Radar), to mapping of variables with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the outputs of these radar systems are required to calibrate in real-time with ground nodes measurements. Therefore, the radar system LAWR, available in the province of Loja-Ecuador intended for research between the University (UTPL) and the autonomous governments (GADs), needs to be complemented with real-time monitoring of variables acquired by the reference weather stations located in the study area. Based on the above, the objective of this work is to design, implement and evaluate a remote real-time monitoring system of weather variables acquired by measuring ground stations based on Davis Vantage Pro. The implemented system is based on GPRS and provides reliable (max. error 1.5%) and timely (every 5 min.) information to enable to researchers intelligent management of territories.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the research of an innovative approach to innovative graphical password model that supports secure authentication in Web systems and wants to solve the shoulder spy problem. To this end, we developed a graphical password model based on two elements: a Web page image that the user has opened in the moment of its enrolment, and strokes drawn with dimensions, directions, and sequences of user choice's. In an exploratory study with participants to validate shoulder spies perceptions, it was found that are more difficult when a user is logging in using a graphical password, than when using an alphanumeric password. The model was designed iteratively and user-centered. To validate its safety and usability, they were made several tests with participants. In these studies, we tried to understand the degree of effectiveness and memorization provided by this password graphical model to users in Web authentication. The results showed that we got a usable and secure solution with potential to be used as an alternative to alphanumeric password, against the shoulder spy in Web authentication.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of reading skills is decisive for the academic achievement of elementary school students. However, unlike other domains of human development, learning to read is a complex process. With this in mind, several attempts have been made to find new educational strategies to foster students reading motivation. That is the context in which Letrinhas appears. Considering the enormous potential of information and communication technologies for education and training, particularly mobile devices, we have developed a digital repository of teaching and learning materials and a multiplatform application that runs on mobile devices. This information system is designed to promote learning and the development of reading in students of the first and second cycles of elementary education and provide teachers with tools for monitoring and assessing reading skills against the curricular targets set by the Ministry of Education. This is no doubt a basic need that is not being met by the applications currently available in the market. The performance of Letrinhas was evaluated by specialists and users in a pilot group and a high level of satisfaction was observed among students and teachers as time and effort spent to consolidate reading is considerably reduced with this application.",

In medicine and nursing, there are extensive examples that illustrate the adaptation of technological components and teaching methods. However, as much as it was possible to ascertain, examples are scarce in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

This project is being developed in partnership with the Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre and the private social solidarity institution CASPAE. It aims to answer specific needs identified in the neurology service during the medical appointments. A common test to assess executive function is the Trail Making Test (TMT). This test is done on paper during the medical appointments for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with the executive function diminished, such as Parkinson's disease patients. The way the TMT is done poses some problems that led to the development of an application for smartphones and tablets, with Android OS. This application has two operating modes: “Appointment”, and “Train”. The “Appointment Mode” makes the realization, reading, and the organization of the tests results easier. The “Train Mode” allows that patients improve their executive function performing tests that are randomly generated on your own smartphone.",

This study presents an assessment of the usability of the qualitative data analysis software webQDA® (version 2.0). To assess its usability, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was used. The results indicate that the current version is “acceptable” in terms of usability.

Includes the processes, roles, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals”. In this paper, we present how to create an IG maturity model based on existing reference documents. The process is based on existing maturity model development methods. These methods allow for a systematic approach to maturity model development backed up by a well-known and proved scientific research method called Design Science Research. Then, based on the maturity model proposed in this paper, an assessment is conducted and the results are presented, this assessment was conducted as a self-assessment in the context of the EC-funded E-ARK project for the seven pilots of the project. The main conclusion from this initial assessment is that there is much room for improvement with most pilots achieving results between maturity level two and three. As future work, the goal is to analyze other references from different domains, such as, records management. These references will enhance, detail and help develop the maturity model making it even more valuable for all types of organization that deal with information governance.",

Its benefits are undeniable: breaking physical, geographical and temporal barriers between health services and its users. The improvement of the ICT had revolutionized the acting and the strategic planning of healthcare organizations, especially on that effectiveness, efficiency and quality. Despite the obvious advantages in its implementation, Telemedicine still far from constituting a daily practice in our country. There are successful experiences in their use, such as Coimbra and Alentejo, but it is clear that its potential is not being harnessed, especially when we compare our country with other European geographical spaces. With this work we intended to understand the evolution of Telemedicine, the advantages and inhibitors to its improvement, and know the actual Portuguese situation as well the future prospects in this area.",

    "abstract": "A Maturity Model is a widely used technique that is proved to be valuable to assess business processes or certain aspects of organizations, as it represents a path towards an increasingly organized and systematic way of doing business. A maturity assessment can be used to measure the current maturity level of a certain aspect of an organization in a meaningful way, enabling stakeholders to clearly identify strengths and improvement points, and accordingly prioritize what to do in order to reach higher maturity levels. However, in order to make that possible, maturity assessments must be performed. Doing that can range from simple self-assessment questionnaires to full blown assessment methods, such as recommended by the ISO15504 or the SEI CMMI. However, a main caveat of these assessments is the resources they encompass, as well as, a lack of actual automation, which many times renders benchmarks not possible. Assuming that the modeling of business domains is becoming a fact with the wide spread of Enterprise Architecture practices, and also considering the recent state of the art on the representation of Enterprise Architecture models using ontologies, this work proposes to follow that trend and innovate by using existing semantic technology to automate maturity models assessment methods.",

The case study is related to publications data mining of AS for physical activities (Fitness) to correlate healthy habits and physical activity, in order to predict the user healthy behavior and hence an improvement in their quality life. To do this, we are developing a data extraction tool throught an AS to Facebook, and its attractive point is the generation of competitive rankings customized by users and that can be published to your Facebook profile. Given the human competitive nature, it is expected a good spread of use of this AS, which will allow data mining to define the PCU healthy habits, where this PCU can be used to entice users to have a better quality of life and in this sense, decrease physical inactivity and risk for diseases associated with inactivity.",

In fact, the most important figures in this equation are the education professionals that work directly with the children. Having this in mind, one of these institutions' main concerns should be to have a clear view of what goes on in the workspace everyday between the professionals and the children. The aim of this work is to propose a model for an information system that reports relevant information regarding the evaluation of education professionals.

These specifications will be mapped to a structure called “Requirements Baseline” (Requirements Base Line), which describes the system's vocabulary using LEL, and scenaries to describe their behavior. Usability specifications will be introduced in stages using transformations, and specified as part of LEL's vocabulary. The use of LEL will allow to create a dictionary, which will contain all the usability specifications. The analyst will be able to integrate, evaluate, define and maintain the traceability of usability specifications in early stages during software process development.",

The disease has symptoms often confused with other febrile syndromes, such as dengue, influenza and viral hepatitis. Improved diagnosis of patients with leptospirosis is very important for health professionals, epidemiological surveillance and primarily for rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment of patients. In this work, an analysis of the data mining techniques classification was performed, evaluating algorithms of the methods of Decision Tree, Classification Rules and Bayesian Classification. Of these, JRip was the model with the best performance, yielding 85% sensitivity and 81% specificity. The algorithms successfully predicted the disease and may represent a new tool to assist health professionals in the daily hospital routine, especially in endemic areas for leptospirosis, accelerating targeted treatment, and minimizing disease exacerbation and mortality.",

In Ecuador, this activity is performed even empirically, through the application of the Pre - Occupational Health Record, in which a thorough physical examination is performed and the pathologic labor history is collected; because despite having legislation setting to perform laboratory tests to complete the study, these are generally not held for lack of funds to pay them by the employer. The computer tool developed helps to the medical professional of floriculture companies in the analysis and evaluation of the accumulated occupational risk factors, thereby minimizing, errors that can occur in assigning a worker to a specific work activity and the probability that for that reason, the worker develops an occupational disease. The implementation of the application is done through algorithms and mathematical - clinical calculations of the elements that affecting in the accumulation of occupational hazards, based on the opinion of experts in occupational health, because there is no scientific evidence about procedures and technical tools to calculate the accumulative occupational risk. The validation performed determined that the tool is effective, because it has a sensibility of 76.19 % and a specificity of 99.28 %, and the tool has a high security having a positive predictive value of 94.11 % and a negative predictive value of 96,50%.",

An example in case is web searches where suggestions and results could be adjusted to the user's knowledge of the language. The objective of this study is to compare the reading habits of users with high and low English language proficiency, having in mind the possible automatic detection of the English proficiency level through reading. For this purpose, a study was conducted with two types of user, those with a high level of proficiency (Proficient Users), and those with low proficiency (Basic Users) in the English language. An eye-tracker was used to collect users' eye movements while reading a text in English. Results show that users with high proficiency engage in more careful reading. In contrast, low English proficiency users take more time to read, revisit sentences and paragraphs more often, have more and longer fixations and also a higher number of saccades. As expected, these users have more difficulties in understanding the text.",

In Ecuador, the Municipalities are the responsible of the operation and maintenance of the drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), nevertheless some Municipalities do not have strategies and tools for water management, this management will increase index of availability and quality of service; one of the components of the water management is the variables monitoring subsystem. Furthermore, according to experts in DWDS, pressure and flow variables are the most relevant for the calculation of performance indicators proposed by the IWA (International Water Association), the OFWAT (Water Services Regulation Authority) and by the ISO 24512 standard (Drinking Water Management). This project proposes the development of hardware architecture of a portable remote monitoring node applied to hydraulic variables pressure and flow in the DWDS; the developed prototype was evaluated in a water node at UTPL campus and also in a water underground node in the DWDS of the Loja city.",

    "abstract": "In mobile applications, user tracking with Global Positioning System (GPS) can be very beneficial, making life easier for the user, by e.g. finding points of interest nearby, such as gas stations, super markets, restaurants etc. Nevertheless, the location of the user can be misused and hence privacy issues can become a relevant problem in mobile application development. Technically, location is determined either internally by the device or externally by interacting systems and networks. The resultant location information may be stored and used under various conditions and applications can track the position of the user without his/her consent and eventually misuse it for instance with the intent of sending redirected publicity or even getting logs of the user's location. However, the user's location may not always be obtained using the most precise location function available. In this work we discuss and propose different options for the accuracy geo localization in an application can be and uphold that it is up to the developer to decide which method is appropriate or that the the user should have the freedom to define his/her privacy thresholds. These thresholds can be extremely variable both between users and scenarios, and we present a survey to approach this issue. Results show that users are concerned with privacy issues, but they are not necessarily acting accordingly to keep their privacy at a high level of protection. Finally, we point out that developers shouldn't misuse possibilities of tracking and users should be more cautious with application permissions as will be shown in a real case study.",

In addition, acquisition of new skills and knowledge is not only affected by an individual's mental schemes or beliefs, but also by their interaction, cooperation and collaboration with others [1]. This perspective fits e.g. in teaching blind and deaf people alongside of children with special educational needs. The aim of the research developed until the moment was to prove that the full integration of the concept of teaching/learning in the light of Feuerstein and Gardner theories is advantageous in this specific field has been proved with children without difficulties [2]. The proposed architecture is based on an intelligent structure supported by Chi-square and a Genetic Algorithm - the evaluation block - supported in a special structured Learning Object, named Knowledge Block - the information and knowledge block [2]. This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) It presents an adaptive system to improve special educational needs; (2) Extends the paradigm to new fields of education as is the special educational needs; (3) Uses a non-linear “thinking” conducting to a correct learning path based on individual special needs of each subject in study; (4) Extends our research paradigm to the ULearning environment.",

The ultimate goal is to understand to what extent this issue is important for users and present results showing that items needed to design a system that is accepted and used in practice by users. To assess the need for platforms for the Digital Heritage Management (PGHDs) and what is the desirable content was conducted a questionnaire on the subject. Analyzing the results of this questionnaire it appears that most respondents did not think about the future of your Digital Heritage is not aware about the policies of online services they use. But the evidence is that the higher the technological maturity of most individuals is likely to be future users of this type of platforms. It also notes that the vast majority of users consider necessary technologically developed using PGHDs in the future.",

    "abstract": "Poker has been gradually gaining the attention of the scientific community, mostly in researchers on Artificial Intelligence. The main reason is concerned with the fact that Poker provides great challenges to the research in the area. Unlike many other games, poker is a stochastic game of imperfect information, which creates a high amount of possibilities to every state of the game. In this work a different line of thought is followed by trying to create an agent capable of reproducing the way a professional Poker human player plays for all stages in a Texas Hold'em Poker game. For this purpose, a high level data model able to comprehend the maximum of information relevant to every state of the game was built, loaded with data from a database containing millions of plays made by a professional poker players, by using Talend Data Integration. To execute Data mining techniques Weka software package was used. The final results show that it is possible to create a virtual poker player that make very similar decisions of a professional poker player.",

The growing complexity of IS, has required the appearance of Information Systems Architectures (ISA) for their management and maintenance. The research team has identified relevance in its applicability within the Portuguese Higher Education Institutions (PHE), and a case study with the University of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD) was drawn. Through the development and implementation of an ISA proposal, UTAD was provided with a transversal view of all the existing IS, allowing validation of the existence/need for IS aimed at managing information and decision-making under a multidimensional perspective, that is, oriented at different organizational levels, from the operational to the strategic level. Given the proposed ISA degree of abstraction, it can be applied to the other institutions within PHE, since they share similar contexts than the one inherent to UTAD.",

Furthermore, a state of the art survey identified few organizational memories studies in institutions of higher education despite being a natural place for research and knowledge management. This work proposes architecture for organizational memory that is based on CESM model and CommonKADS methodology; this architecture is concerned with the knowledge representation for semantic search of documents. Furthermore, a systematic review of the state of the art was performed to support the design of the architecture and compare the proposed architecture with the proposed architectures in the academic community.",

The objective of this paper is to show the steps followed and the results obtained. The process of the creation of Heartkeeper is divided into three phases. The first is the design of the app, focusing on its functional requirements and its general aspect. The second is its implementation, where the operating system of the app is thought, along with the tools used for its development. The final phase is the validation, where Heartkeeper is tested in different mobile devices. The interface created offers a clear application easy to use at first time based on image buttons. The response times of Heartkeeper operations are of the order of milliseconds except for encryption/decryption operations, which can reach 2 seconds in old devices. Heartkeeper were successfully tested in 5 devices with different screen sizes.",

    "abstract": "The growing needs of more productive and efficient computer programs require professionals able to develop and to manage high-quality software in a systematic, controlled and appropriate way. Over 35 years ago, the term Software Engineering was coined to define the use of methods for the development, operation and maintenance of the software. Since then the expression has been used in the industry, organizations and academia. Several universities around the world have created the Software Engineering degree or courses. In Latin America there are few universities that offer this knowledge area, at least with the name of Software Engineering. Ecuador has been a pioneer in the creation of this profession, when in 2008 the Army Force University ESPE implements the degree, which remains the unique in the country. After six years of its implementation, the Council of Higher Education of Ecuador (CES) established that all the Ecuadorian Universities must redesign offered degree or could create new ones. Taking the advantages of this opportunity, the Software Engineering degree at ESPE was redesigned. In this paper, we present the redesign process followed and the results obtained. Additionally, we describe the experience gained through these six years, considering the scientific community of the ESPE - professors, students and graduated - and generating through the review of documents and surveys the results of the research. The results of the paper represent a contribution for national and international universities which wish to change the curriculum of theirs degrees according to the new requirements and current labor market.",

Apart from some text data compiled from hospital records, most of the researchers in this field evaluate their classification methodologies on documents retrieved from MEDLINE database. OHSUMED is one of the widely used datasets containing MEDLINE documents as multi-labeled. In this study, the impact of feature selection on medical document classification is analyzed using two datasets containing MEDLINE documents. The performances of two different feature selection methods namely Gini Index and Distinguishing Feature Selector are analyzed using two pattern classifiers. These pattern classifiers are Bayesian network and C4.5 decision tree. As this study deals with single-label classification, a subset of documents inside OHSUMED and a self-constructed dataset is used for assessment of feature selection methods. Due to having low amount of documents for some categories in self-compiled dataset, only documents belonging to 10 different disease categories are used in the experiments for both datasets. Experimental results show that the combination of Distinguishing Feature Selector and Bayesian Network classifier gives more accurate results in most cases than the others.",

At last, we draw on Multidimensional Scaling to visualize and validate the results of Hierarchical Clustering Analysis. So the corresponding positions of different sellers' self-input items in the existing category hierarchy can be determined. An empirical study has also been undertaken with the log data of one Chinese e-commerce website. The achievements of this paper can be applied to determine the most proper category hierarchy or recommend the top N categories for sellers' consideration when they list items on e-commerce websites.",

The technologies were a bit tricky in setting up and it was recommended that the researchers, in addition to special work sessions with the teachers, team taught with the teachers for their first time using the technologies. Human factors issues focused on ease of use and intuitiveness of technologies for both teachers and students.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the optimal resource location problems used for large public service systems designing. Such problems have many practical applications in different areas of human life. To describe the problems, the weighted p-median problem is usually formulated. A standard objective in this formulation is to minimize the total disutility, like social costs. The social costs are often proportional to the distance travelled by all system users to the nearest located source of provided service. If a large instance of the problem is described by a location-allocation model, then the model size often exceeds any acceptable limit for available optimization software. It must be noted, that the numbers of served users and possible service center locations may take the value of several hundreds or thousands. To avoid this obstacle, the approximate approach based on a radial formulation with homogenous system of radii given by so-called dividing points has been developed. In this paper, we present both exact and approximate approaches to the weighted p-median problem and study, how the number of dividing points used for distance approximation impacts the solution accuracy and computational time. All reported models of the decision problems are described by means of mathematical programming. To obtain the optimal solution, the universal optimization environment XPRESS-IVE was used.",

In this paper we describe the design and results of teacher training in-service course, accredited by the Scientific and Pedagogical Council of Continuous Training, in the context of Information Technology. This action sought to promote the practices of teachers in the design and development of DER using the resources of the DTS. We analyzed the videos produced by the teachers during the training course, we conducted individual interviews with participating teachers and we applied a questionnaire in order to assess teachers' opinions and satisfaction about the training and the application of skills learned to educational practice. The main results point out that teachers said they were available to receive more specific training, mainly practical, in order to use the DTS and produce educational videos. They were satisfied with the training received, but they liked to have more hours of training, which is not always compatible with their academic load. They thought it is good to share the video production with the students, and that these technologies are effective in improving learning.",

    "abstract": "In the management of distributed software development, project managers face many challenges. Some of the most critical ones are related to the allocation of tasks between remote teams. To assign a task to a site or team, the project manager should take into account several factors such as team's technical expertise and cultural similarities. He or she usually makes this decision in a subjective way. The verbal decision analysis is an approach based on solving problems through multi-criteria qualitative analysis, which means it considers the analysis of subjective criteria. This paper describes the application of verbal decision analysis method ZAPROS III-i to rank order the factors that the project managers should take into account when allocating tasks in distributed software development projects.",

However, many data are unusable if they are alone or out of context but a combination of these data can be valuable. This idea is also present in the information gathered by the human senses. The human body uses the senses to gather data about the environment in order to take the best possible decisions taking into consideration the whole environment. Our proposal is based on the same idea. We propose the creation of several subsystems that would simulate the human senses and another subsystem capable to manage them, and take decisions based on the data gathered by all subsystems. In this way, the data gathered by one subsystem would be complemented with the data gathered by the rest of systems as the human body does.",

In this context, this paper aims to suggest the use of Comic Books in the process of requirements elicitation within a business model and evaluate the results of applying this technique. To reach this target, authors proposed a scenario simulation method using Comic Books. Two experiments were applied to validate the proposal outlined in this paper. The first involved 8 professionals from a software development company and the second involved 17 professionals. All those professionals developed a comic book in order to map a business process within their work environment. In the end of the experiment, those professionals have answered a questionnaire, analyzing the comic books which had been developed. The results have been assessed in a positive way, showing thereby that the use of comic books facilitates the details and requirements elicitation process.",

To support the automatic identification of valuable Web 2.0 resources, this paper presents an approach for estimating the information value of messages posted to an online forum. The system integrates key insights that include (1) how to reliably obtain large quantities of both positive and negative examples of such resources for use in training a machine learning algorithm, (2) the importance of considering authorship when analyzing the value of an online message, (3) the benefit of considering the subsequent message when analyzing a given message for its importance, and (4) how to develop and leverage a custom sentiment analysis model for use in automatically identifying high-value messages. In an evaluation using almost 90000 messages from an online forum, a baseline model for identifying valuable messages made over 50% more errors than the proposed model.",

In mobile health, triggering survey questions based on patient health, context, and other external information can aid in tailoring a survey to each specific user's particular situation. However, creating such a survey with existing systems is burdensome. Therefore, this paper presents a novel information system to ease the creation and deployment of context-aware, location-based surveys. In a within-subjects experiment, 12 participants with minimal programming expertise created context-aware, location-based surveys more quickly and with fewer errors than with a competing commercially-available system that lacked support for questions triggered by physical phenomena, showing the potential usefulness of the approach for future research studies.",

The FA is a metaheuristic based on the mating behavior or flash of fireflies, in order to communicate with each other or attract potential prey. Fireflies move through the search space by means of attraction that they feel toward other fireflies until the stop criteria established is complied. Finally, to test the efficiency of FA, the results obtained have been compared with previous research illustrating encouraging results.",

With the intensification of competition between companies in open markets and often saturated, companies must learn to know themselves and to the market through the collection and analysis of quality information. The strategic information is seen as a key resource for success in the business, which is provided by Business Intelligence systems. A successful business strategy requires an awareness of the surrounding (internal and external) environment of organizations, including customers, competitors, industry structure and competitive forces. Managing the future means not only is able to anticipate what will happen outside the organization, but also be able to represent the events through their own actions timely.

    "abstract": "Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm that allows for solving optimization and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). In this context, a main concern of this technology is that the efficient problem resolution usually relies on the employed solving strategy. Unfortunately, selecting the proper one is known to be complex as the behavior of strategies is commonly unpredictable. Recently, Autonomous Search appeared as a new technique to tackle this concern. The idea is to let the solver adapt its strategy during solving time in order to improve performance. This task is controlled by a choice function which decides, based on performance information, how the strategy must be updated. In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the solving phase of 16 different choice functions. We employ as test bed a set of well-known benchmarks that collect general features present on most CSPs. Interesting experimental results are obtained in order to provide the best-performing choice functions for solving CSPs.",

This paper develops and analyzes a system to assess the emotional affinity that an individual experiences when it is exposed to a particular broadcast advertising in terms of their bioelectrical brain activity (EEG signals). The system integrates a brain interface computer BCI and a set of adaptive vector models, which carry out the progressive identification emotional patterns in audiovisual advertising, from a series of visual emotional patterns learned reference models, and defined in terms of EEG signals. Results from the system, show the effectiveness and flexibility that have the integrated vectorial models to identify emotional patterns present in an audiovisual advertising.",

According to the Media Naturalness Theory [1], the effectiveness of e-learning is affected by differences in naturalness level of the communication media. The present study compared between learning in a face-to-face environment and learning in two online conditions (one-way and two-way video conferencing). We examined the influence of medium naturalness and personality traits (extroversion-introversion and emotional stability-neuroticism) on students' achievements and perceived learning. A controlled experiment was conducted with 76 participants attending a lesson that was composed of several teaching-learning components: frontal lecture, instructor-students interactions, students-instructor interactions, and peer interactions. Zoom videoconferencing application, which allows spontaneous participation, was utilized for e-learning. Results indicate that for the face-to-face learning condition, achievement was higher compared to one-way videoconferencing only for fact-related questions, but not for inference questions or overall test score. We also found that low level of medium naturalness was associated with lower scores only for neurotic students. No clear evidence that links extroversion-introversion trait to academic performance was found. All aspects of perceived learning showed consistent advantage for emotionally stable participants and extroverts, compared to neurotic students and introverts.",

Main results show that innovative SMEs display a 52.83% level of compliance, in which dimensions like “strategic planning”, “human resources” and “social responsibility” are the ones that require further improvement in terms of innovation. Furthermore, social media used by SMEs to advertise their services are primarily web pages and social networks like Facebook® and Youtube®. On the other hand, Instagram®, Twitter® and LinkedIn® show a lesser extent. Finally, this research determines that despite the existence of web 2.0 tools managers are still using traditional means of publicity for safety and fidelity reasons.",

    "abstract": "The online media in a context of proximity has experimented in recent years a series of transformations towards new communicative and business models, due to the economic recession and the crisis of the newspapers' traditional model suffered by the media industry. In a global context of crisis in the traditional local media sector, readers express a growing necessity of information about the geographical areas nearest to them. This has favored the proliferation of a great diversity of new communicative spaces on the internet. The online media in a context of proximity tends to be web-native, cover hyperlocal areas and built community projects where citizen participation becomes especially relevant. This research focus on the study of the local and hyperlocal online media of Galicia and Portugal, on the basis of a media of proximity map in the Iberian space that is being developed. In this way, we compare two areas that, although pertaining to different countries, are very close about cultural issues. The main objective of the present study is to measure and check the presence of this type of media on the social networks, observing which are the most used platforms and the importance of the communities that are maintained by the media in those spaces. It is therefore an exploratory and very descriptive work that allows a first approximation to the social networks' functions in the creation of spaces for socialization, participation and debate between the citizens of the local communities.",

    "abstract": "The use of Twitter in the political communication field has increased considerably in the last years. Its potential as a communicative tool, specifically in electoral campaigns, and its capacity to improve the relation with the citizenry are some of the reasons to explain their rise. Specifically, the last aspect constitutes one of the major benefits of this platform: the possibility of establishing a dialogue with citizens, which encourages conversation from direct contact technologically mediated. The goal of this paper is to analyze the official Twitter profile of Partido Socialista (PSOE) and Podemos during the campaign of the 2015 Spanish elections to examine the degree of compliance with the principles dialogic attributed to social media. For this purpose, the proposed Kent and Taylor (1998) for digital media and subsequent adaptation of Ribalko and Seltzer (2010) for Twitter is taken as a starting point. The methodology is based on a quantitative approach from the application of the technique of content analysis in order to observe the use that each of the political parties analyzed made of Twitter, particularly its potential for generating dialogue with citizens. The sample focuses on the electoral campaign of the general elections celebrated in Spain on December, 20th 2015. Specifically, we analyze the 15 day campaign, the reflection day, the election day and the day after these. During this period, it will be studied the message shared by two political parties (PSOE and Podemos) in their Twitter official profiles. In this way, a traditional political party and a new one can be compared. The obtained results shows that both PSOE and Podemos produce a big amount of tweets that accomplish with some of the dialogic principles that reflect the existence of interaction between the profiles of the party and their principle leaders. Nevertheless, data shows that conversation of both political parties with their followers is limited. This finding question the use of the interactivity and dialogic capacity that are attributed to social media in the digital political communication during the electoral campaigns.",

The main focus of this work was to verify if it was possible to increase the sense of presence through multi-sensory stimulation, creating a virtual environment of simulation that causes stress in exposure therapy, in this case in people who have a fear of heights. The evaluation of the sense of presence was made using the Portuguese version of a previously validated IPQ (Igroup Presence Questionnaire) and also through direct observation of the movements caused by oculomotor reflexes. Although the achievement results that were not very significant between the two tested groups, the multisensory simulation environment obtained better results in terms of involvement in relation to space and realism, which increased concentration in the experience. The obtained results seem to indicate that the alone addition of further stimuli does not lead to an increased feeling of presence, therefore existing the need to understand which are the critical stimuli for each assessment situation.",

These notifications must be manually analyzed by procurators to determine what kind of document should they prepare to respond. This situation causes in many cases notifications are not answered in time causing these prescribed. All this has motivated the development of this work whose main objective is the development of a computational model to understand the meaning of each notification and indicate what kind of response should be prepared for every situation. For the construction of this model, machine-learning algorithms are used. The problem is modeled as one of classification using free text documents. The texts were extracted from notification documents, which were written in Portuguese. The method to assess the performance of the algorithms was the area under the curve. During the experiment, four algorithms were evaluated, including k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Complement Naive Bayes. The algorithms were trained using a collection of Portuguese documents in the juridical domain, which includes 5471 documents divided into 8 categories. A 25-fold cross validation method was used to measure the unbiased estimate of these prediction models. This paper is a comparative study of machine learning algorithms for the problem of categorization of notifications. As a result of this study, an algorithm model was constructed in order to classify the documents in the corresponding class. The area under the curve value of Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Complement Naive Bayes was 0.846, 0.831, 0.815 and 0.712 respectively. Our study shows that out of these four classification models Support Vector Machine predicts with highest area under the curve value.",

This research applies the Gini coefficient as a measure of the specialization and location degree of tourist activity obtained using as a variable the employed population of the database of the Ministry of Tourism. The results show that the province of Guayas and Galapagos have different tourist structures from the rest of the country. With regard to the location, tourist transport sectors and food and beverage stand out as concentrated activities and with options to generate business network in tourism entrepreneurship.",

    "abstract": "Air traffic flow has faced a big increase in the last decade, becoming one of the main transportation solutions. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aeronautical industries are both predicting a growth between 150% and 250% over the next two decades. With this increasing number of aircrafts in the air, airports need also to improve their scheduling strategies to better control the coordination of landing planes. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCO) seek to minimize the waiting time on the aircraft waiting queue. However the ATCO normally use a First Come First Served (FCFS) technique driven by its simplicity. However, it has the disadvantage of offering poor performance when opposed to other strategies. Aiming to characterize and evaluate this performance and compare it with other algorithms, we have tested the application of some scheduling meta-heuristics to this problem, namely Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Experiments show that SA outperforms TS by up to 55% and FCFS by up to 19%. We recommend that using the SA could help managers enhance their decisions over the currently used policies (FCFS) by providing a better scheduling for landing control and saving companies' time and money.",

However, the state of the art of HDR video focus mainly on conventional sized displays typical of TVs or PCs. As the usage of mobile devices for multimedia consumption is increasing considerably, there is a need for studying the impact of the viewing of HDR video on such devices. This will allow to take full advantage of HDR technology, creating a set of opportunities for the digital business as it allows, among others, the presentation of products in a much more efficient and captivating way. On this paper it is presented a study that evaluates the impact of the HDR video delivery on mobile devices and compares it with the impact of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) content. Results show that the delivery of HDR video on mobiles is possible without requiring much more resources when comparing the delivery of LDR video.",

On one hand, the enormous amount of information that is generated allows the extraction of knowledge with great accuracy concerning the disease, the treatments and the impact it has on society, on the other hand, this continuous monitoring allows effective control and one timely intervention on the patient. The QoLIS platform has a set of characteristics advantageous over other, including the wide range of analyses that can be made from the results that it provides. However, the complexity of the calculus evolved on the models used, combined with the number of data processing, hamper its use in real time, hindering their use in the context of a medical appointment. Whereas the use of evaluation of quality of life (QoL) in the context of a appointment is an added value for everyone involved, it was necessary to develop and implement, on the QoLIS, a strategy for determining the value of QoL, by estimate, based on Rasch model (in order to provide the same set of responses) and whose response time allows its effective use.",

Specifically, the game addresses educational objectives included in the curriculum of non-technological careers, such as the identification and analysis of concepts related to basic hardware components of a computer. These objectives are joined with those of a video game, i.e., live an attractive, motivating and enriching experience. The game has focused on the interaction between the player, who plays the role of a student, a 3D virtual computer, and a character who plays the role of the teacher. The player interacts with the computer and answers a series of inquiries posed by the teacher, all related to components of the 3D computer located in the game scenario, which represents the teacher's office. For each correct answer, the player receives a sounded feedback and messages of encouragement from the teacher, as well as points. Once the player completes each level, the result is stored and can be displayed in a scoreboard. Game analysis has been done using the so-named LM-GM framework, which is an analytical model proposed by GaLA (Game and Learning Alliance, the European Network of Excellence on Serious Games), that maps learning mechanics (LM) to game mechanics (GM). The results of the analysis indicate that the serious game seemly integrates learning objectives as well as LM and GM.",

The first one is the Penta case, which allowed the irregular financing of election campaigns of politicians mainly from right-wing. The second case is about influence peddling involving the son of President Bachelet. This is important because if we detect an inequity in the treatment of both cases, we can see that this platform is not built as a universal public space where subjects have no place.",

In this context, the Internet and social media are consolidating as platforms for information, production, interaction, collaboration and scientific evaluation, creating the need of new indicators to measure the impact that publications acquire in this universe. It arises a new type of alternative metrics- or altmetrics-, which base their activity on the web environment, measuring the influence that academic papers achieve through online platforms. However, some limitations of these indicators and, specially, the existence of certain resistance to change, both by industry of scientific publication and the researchers themselves, have caused a restricted use of this type of e-tools, limiting the impact and attention that academic papers acquire in social media.",

The transition to college can be a challenging event due to unique environment changes. So first-year students are special vulnerable to stress which has been associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including general and health-related QoL. Difficulties in integrating the system are common, among them are adjustment problems to learning and teaching models. This work focus on first-year students of a higher education health school, were coexist mainly two teaching models: problem based learning (PBL) and traditional (TTM). This study aims to compare the two models concerning QoL. The results suggest that QoL is good in both models, but TTM scored higher values in each dimension of QoL. Regarding personal accomplishment feelings, PBL students had significantly higher values. Our findings highlight the importance of the pedagogical model on student well-being, especially on beliefs concerning their abilities, expectations of success and self-efficacy already on 1st year.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of scientific publications and the availability of information in online repositories enable researchers to discover, analyze and maintain an updated state of the art bibliography. Indeed, few works explore this scenario in order to support researchers on the literature review step. Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research. Experiments showed good results on learning performance when using a hybrid approach, increasing testing performance in 12%, achieving 89.05% in accuracy when classifying a paper as relevant.",

There are already solutions that try to meet the new requirements; however, the changing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) require a rapid and demanding adaptation. In this context it is assumed that education systems must address the backgrounds diversity of students, taking into account their need in order to provide access to learning objects, as well as the validation of knowledge of each student. In this paper, we propose a model where all the learning and e-learning elements are present and where the student is the focus and the one who decides what should be included in this learning environment in order to create a Customized Learning Environment.",

    "abstract": "A vast body of research has been exploring the effectiveness of Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) in second language teaching and encouraging the incorporation of MALL into pedagogical practice (Bárcena, E. et al 2015, Kukulska-Hulme et al. 2015). Paradoxically, however, pre-service teachers tend to be unfamiliar with the benefits of using of mobile devices in language teaching and learning. Thus continued exposure to mobile-enhanced lessons is essential to the development of effective mobile-based tasks by pre-service teachers (Kevin et al. 2011). Considering that Initial Teacher Education is essential for shaping positive attitudes towards mobile technologies, this study aims to investigate how to best integrate MALL into Initial Teacher Education programs for second language teachers at the University of Coimbra. The goal of our study will be a) to prompt pre-service teachers to reflect on their use of mobile technologies (Kevin et. al. 2011), b) to engage pre-service teachers in effective mobile-learning activities (Hockly 2013) and c) to encourage lesson planning skills within recently developed mobile-enhanced pedagogical frameworks (Kukulska-Hulme et. al. 2015). In this paper, we describe our study and provide an outline of the phases that will be implemented, drawing implications about the challenges of mobile-learning for Initial Teacher Education in Portugal. While our study addresses primarily the needs identified through our contact with pre-service teachers of English, our discussion is also applicable to other content areas.",

From a total of 46 observations and its its CANVAS Business Model have been created a corporative website, a facebook account, a Twitter account, an instagram account, and 3 youtube videos; all accounts were linked among them and they only used search engine optimization. Digital immigrants, (existing physically businesses but without any digital visualization) had greater amount of online sales rather than digital native businesses (enterprises with no physical existence nor digital). Results are attributed to brand recognition, since previous trust was built already within the target market and therefore the greater amount of sales from digital immigrants businesses. However, it is highly recommended a study of consumer behavior related to the time it is needed to generate trust for native digital businesses to get recognition and generate a positive action about the brand.",

To meet the goal has been realized a sample of 113 manufacturing companies that produce textiles for the years 2000 to 2012, the same information was obtained from the superintendency of companies of Ecuador. The methodology used is an econometric panel data model using multiple regression with random effects. The dependent variable is the LEVERAGE or financial leverage, and the independent variables are: liquidity, ROE, Net Return on assets (RNA), inflation and GDP. It will be determined by this model assumptions embedded the method of ordinary least squares (OLS) with the proposition of diverse hypotheses about the significance of each explanatory variable in the model with respect to the dependent variable. The expected results of this study are based on the relationships that determine the independent variables on the endogenous variable. The results obtained empirical evidence that mentions that the leverage depends positively on the ROE and that the relationship is negative with variable RNA, inflation and liquidity, while GDP is not statistically influence on the capital structure of enterprises.",

For this reason, knowledge discovery techniques, clustering, text mining and data mining algorithms were used. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study was implemented to evaluate the performance of data mining techniques in this type of database. The results showed that the data mining process and clustering techniques guided to the classification proposed method for extracting relations and knowledge from a group of metadata extracted from within the database.",

Communicational performances organizations have multiplied and the media and the possibilities of public response. However, communication departments in organizations that exist in the north insistently project themes and brand identity. The areas that have transformed their structures and reformed their fields of action, result, on the one hand, from the analysis and application of the Communications Law created in 2013, seriously affecting the inclusion of media professionals in the companies, who are called to execute processes of institutional management.

The solution devised is based on an adaptive information system (IS) able to use physical and behavioral data of the patient, gathered by sensors and mobile devices, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, allowing continuous assessment of QoL based on measurement tools that significantly reduce the questionnaires response time without affecting the patients daily life. Continuous assessment of QoL and its rapid use on a clinical decision support system will enable a better quality and more supported decision, patient-centered, by the physician, allowing for an increased quality of life of patients.",

This game which has the possibility to use playfulness to the development of affective, cognitive and social aspects. Knowing that to play the role of mediator, the teacher can encourage students to question, search for and express themselves more, the following study aims to awaken through the games, the collective interest of the players by the research. The application and creation of the study took place between the years 2008 and 2011, it, elementary school students and top of a Brazilian state called in Rio Grande do Sul visualized cards with images of paintings artwork and sequence created, interpreted and modified rules of action based on the characteristics of these images and research conducted within and outside the school environment. The rules of action prepared for the game could be performed through drawings, sounds, speech or body language capable of representing the images contained in the letters. It is also considered that by combining playfulness to search through the interpretation of the images, develop affective, cognitive and social aspects, it contributes to the learning and training of people in the artistic field.",

The methodology is qualitative and quantitative through interviews, content analysis and revision of the statistics of the Superintendency of Communication. The study concludes that the definition of communication as a public service shows no contradiction with some legal traditions or affects the freedom of expression; it also reflects imbalance in the information of the print media; and; that the decisions of the Superintendent serve the compliance of rights rather than the relationship of public services.",

Technological advances are then required to promote flexible and adaptive systems with the ability to reconfigure their offered services in a cost effective manner. In spite of the current research efforts, there is still a lack of automated tools to support the service reconfiguration capability at run-time, being the understanding of when and how to reconfigure crucial to support an efficient reconfiguration process. This paper focuses on the problematic of when to reconfigure a system, with the proposed service-based multi-agent system performing the dynamic service reconfiguration based on triggering strategies. This allows to discover reconfiguration opportunities to maintain the system stable and competitive, but also to explore and promote new system configurations when needed. The envisaged triggering strategies, implemented through the intelligence mechanisms embedded in the agents' behaviors, consist in the event, periodic and trend approaches following the reactive, predictive and preventive behaviors. The preliminary experimental results validate the feasibility of such triggering strategies for service reconfiguration leading to more efficient and agile systems.",

A stimulus - organism - response model was assessed in an experiment involving two groups, one experiencing a vivid platform and the other a more informational one. The response was posited to be mediated by the affect elicited during the experience. The results show that the urge to buy was not prevalent, but it was significantly higher in the group exposed to the vivid site. The variance of urge to buy was largely accounted buy the variance of positive arousal (delight). Negative affect, as well as low arousal positive affect (relax) have small negative effects on the urge. These results confirm our expectation that a simple distinction between negative and positive affect is insufficient to predict the urge, since the level of arousal also plays a fundamental role to trigger the urge.",

    "abstract": "By default, in the execution of processes supported by BPMS (Business Processes Management System) any task requiring human intervention is delivered to all the persons registered on the corresponding “role”. This article argues that in order to optimize the execution of work in organizations it is necessary to conciliate the characteristics of the tasks to be performed and the social and human aspects of the people who may perform them. In this sense the BPMS, while managing the execution of organizational processes, should be prepared to select the human resources which are more suitable to perform each task, taking into account their own characteristics, and those of the people who can accomplish them.",

    "abstract": "Public Administration organizations handle increasingly higher amounts of information in digital format. Therefore, more rigorous and comprehensive security controls are indispensable. In literature, security policies assume a paramount role among security measures. However, a 2010 study reveals the existence of a low number of City Councils where information systems security policies are implemented [1]. This paper's contribution is to compare the data from that study with 2016 data by presenting the results of a survey conducted on the Local Public Administration in Portugal. The results are discussed in light of literature and future works are identified with the aim of enabling the adoption of security policies in Public Administration.",

    "abstract": "Legal informatics has seriously transformed the practice of law over all aspects, especially in the court activities and bringing actions to enforce rights. This has generated a trend towards law integration and uniformity on legal proceedings. This requires frequent updates on regulatory laws due to first advances of CIT. In this paper we present contemporary challenges on legal informatics and how main contributions of the Workshop INJU meet them. The Workshop includes three presentation about documental informatics: a study on Traceability of the law from Chile, another study of document management from Peru and third one from Denmark which describes a software tool that provides access to relevant court information without affecting privacy. Also the workshop includes an experience on the implementation of electronic management of Tribunales Populares Cubanos.",
