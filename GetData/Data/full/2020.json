    "abstract": "Despite the constant increase in households of smart devices for individual use, television remains a familiar meeting point for entertainment [1]. With the emergence of hybrid television, a new multi-user environment that combines traditional television and the Internet emerges. The STVALL project takes advantage of this new panorama by proposing the development of an educational platform for interactive and adaptive teaching, individual or group, of languages through smart television. Through the use of HbbTV technology, customized training pills stored in the knowledge base of the platform and generated by language experts will be offered to the user or the user group. This article presents the authoring tool that allows the creation of these training pills by the team of experts. In addition, some of these pills require some feedback from experts to users, so this authoring tool provides the necessary mechanisms to provide it.",

    "abstract": "Video games are understood by society, particularly young people, and young adults, as a form of entertainment. However, given the transformation of society towards the digital, in recent years the games have crossed the barriers of entertainment, and have been used in more ambitious environments and purposes, especially in business and education. In this context, this practice is called gamification, being used at education and aims to make the teaching and learning more attractive and motivating. Gamification, as noted, has the principles of video games, i.e., leverage the elements of the games, which underpin its enormous success, to make learning more engaging, customizable and relevant. Its use in the teaching- learning process has been carried out in parallel with active methodologies, and in the use of learning management systems that include various elements of the game to be integrated into teaching, learning and evaluation activities. In this paper, the gamified programmatic contents idea is presented, and it specifies a level-based programmatic contents structure as well as other gamification elements used, such as points and different types of rewards, the progress bar, the leaderboard, content locking and trading. The gamified programmatic contents will be implemented on the Moodle platform.",

    "abstract": "The orientation in indoor spaces and the knowledge of the areas within an establishment such as companies, shopping mall, museums, universities, libraries, among others, is important to guide people through the architecture and areas that the establishment has, thus providing a better service, a quality experience and generating greater satisfaction. Sometimes it happens that there are people who find it difficult to reach a destination in indoors spaces. The attention or personalized guides that help guide in these situations are almost nil in some cases, which causes the user to give up in his search, it consumes a lot of time and generate disinterest in returning to that establishment. This paper presents a solution to the aforementioned problem and is the design and implementation of a system for indoor positioning using Beacon technology. The system consists of two parts, a web application for information management and a mobile application for interaction with beacons in order to guide users to their destinations or display notifications regarding the current location.",

    "abstract": "Area estimation of circular or ellipsoidal object on an image is a current issue in computer vision. Several methods that address this problem have been previously presented, but it turned out that they do not give satisfactory results when dealing with noisy images. As part of the research presented in this paper, a statistical model for estimating the width of uniform distribution for data contaminated with additive error was applied in order to approach the mentioned problem in an innovative manner. Initially, a method for length estimation of intersection of an object with an arbitrary line has been developed. It is possible to estimate the set of object's edge points using this method. Further, a circle or an ellipse is fitted in that set of points and its area is calculated, which approximates the area of the object itself. It is also possible to estimate the area of a circular or ellipsoidal object represented by a set of points in the plane.The presented method was implemented and publicly released as a package for the programming language R. The method has been extensively tested on the problem of estimating the area of objects recorded using RGB-D camera. Different noise levels were added to the captured images, and estimation results were compared with the ones obtained by several established methods. The test results showed that the method presented in this paper gives qualitatively the best results of area estimation when dealing with noisy images.",

The present work has as proposal the development of a prototype of Android application based on beacons technology called \"TK-2\" for the assistance of people with cognitive disabilities in the execution of tasks, which is designed with activities of ascending difficulty and automatic data collection, which shows results on the screen of the device, thanks to this the data are visible, accurate and reliable. In the execution of tests, users were considered based on the experience (average and none) in the proposed activity. These results were contrasted to determine that the application contributes to gradually reduce the evaluation parameters (time, errors and aids) until the user begins to perform the activity independently, also understood as TK-2 acts in activities that are rare and those that are repetitive.",

At time of writing, a technical solution that would benefit both parties has not yet been presented. With the existing model (no operational integration), both OTTs and CSPs are dissatisfied. This paper proposes a technical solution that can be beneficial to both parties and can potentially solve the existing conflicts. The solution presents the high-level design of Business Processes to integrate the OTT Service Platforms in CSP Operations. Some hypothetical, but close to reality scenarios were defined in order to show how the model could be applied. The design of the models incorporates information and suggestions collected from Portuguese CSPs. To evaluate the accuracy of the methodology, a set of interviews were conducted with industry experts, who evaluated each model of the solution. A set of surveys from users of these types of services was also conducted, in order to understand their opinions about the ideas used in the construction of the model.",

    "abstract": "The impact of the digital revolution has influenced society significantly in many ways, including with Artificial Intelligence (AI). The advantages and disadvantages of AI and what can be and should be done in order to influence that in a positive way are discussed. The study is based on interviews (ten) and survey answers (from 100 respondents). The survey results show that there is a general concern about the impact of AI in the future (the negative impact on work and related to a general loss of control). Furthermore, more than 50% of the answers lead to the thought that “Humans will learn to use the power of computers to improve their own skills and be ahead of AI”. As concerns the interviews, it was interesting to realize that practical courses, such as students studying engineering, were the ones who were afraid of AI instead of the social ones. This may be because the engineering students are the ones who know more about AI so they better realize the possible implications of AI on their future jobs. Another possible reason is that non-engineering students believe that human sensibility needed in their fields of study is more difficult to reproduce by AI machines than technical skills present in other fields of study/jobs.",

Cloud computing has been widely used and is a reality in all sectors that demand computational use allied with security and with ease of management. Gigantic data centers were created to meet ever-increasing demand. Processing, memory and storage are delivered to end customers who do not have the energy, cooling, hardware, software, licensing and management concerns, paying only for what they really need. Considering that the user requests resources to perform a certain task, it is necessary to create efficient mechanisms of allocation of resources and fair collection metrics. In this work a review is made of concepts of cloud computing and resource scheduling and analyze two scheduling algorithms that use particle swarm. Finally, the particle swarm algorithm is implemented to make analysis of the best parameter configuration to meet the demand for virtual machine-allocation in cloud computing. The amount of CPU, memory and disk is considered for calculation.",

    "abstract": "The use of technology in mathematics instruction has recently received much attention in education research. However, the concept of flipped classroom is relatively new particularly in Sub Saharan Africa higher education classroom. This study compares the effectiveness of flipped classroom, small group discussion, and group work and presentation on college students' achievement in decision making theory. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative methods whereby data are collected through in class tests and questionnaires respectively. One hundred twenty-one bachelor's degree students pursuing business studies and IT, form the study population. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal Wallis and One-way ANOVA are used to analyze the quantitative data while qualitative data are analyzed through content analysis. Results reveal improvement in the performance of students in small group discussion and flipped classrooms. It was found that small group discussion had higher effect on learning gains than flipped classroom, but the difference was not statistically significant. About lesson enjoyment, non-significant differences were found but a small effect size favored flipped classroom. Qualitative results indicate that, students had pleasant learning experiences, active learning, and improved outcomes. With regards to academic self-efficacy, non-significant differences were observed, however a small effect size was in favor of small group discussion. Qualitative findings reveal that, the use of collaborative learning strategies, frequent tests and exercises, and technology tools can improve students' academic self-efficacy. The findings encourage lecturers to make use of collaborative learning strategies, regular assessment as well as online videos to enhance students' academic achievement.",

Rather than indifference or refusal, this tendency is a harnessing of latent potential and an effort to adapt school to the importance of technology in society. New ways of teaching and learning using the smartphone allow the design of activities that apply apps as a didactic tool for use in the classroom. The aim of this research is to find a set of indicators that permit teachers to evaluate apps from a repository they have used, are using or intend to use in educational context and want to share with the community to facilitate their proper adoption. The problem of the possible impacts of the use of the smartphone on memory, attention or other cognitive dimensions is out of the scope of this work: we focused essentially on its potential as a means to explicit knowledge and increase motivation and collaboration. So, we propose an analysis organized into three categories and 23 attributes.",

    "abstract": "Preparing learners for the demands of 21st century society requires a comprehensive approach that integrates the development of cognitive and interpersonal skills as well as the choice for innovative pedagogical strategies that assign teachers and learners new roles and give room for the integration of technology enhanced learning. Peer learning promotes collaboration and interaction between peers and can be used by teachers as a powerful strategy to foster students' cognitive, affective and social skills. The inclusion of ICT tools in peer learning programs has become more and more relevant based on their potential to foster learners' autonomy, collaboration, and communication skills as well as on the pervasiveness of mobile and social media tools. The present multiple case study focuses on analyzing the role of ICT tools in five peer learning projects implemented in five Portuguese educational institutions through the perceptions of teachers and peer teacher students who integrated them. A semi-structured interview and a survey by questionnaire were the tools used and the data collected were treated under content analysis and descriptive statistics. Findings from this study are expected to add insight into the state of the art of ICT tools usage and role in promoting effective learning in peer learning projects.",

Robots have become an attractive and more common tool in these operations. Even though there still are challenges to overcome with them. These challenges arise predominantly in the way they are controlled and monitored. Challenges like complex and costly infrastructure are the main obstacle to have a widespread use of these robots. This article presents an architecture for the control and monitoring of search and rescue robots based in serverless technologies to reduce infrastructure complexity, cost and setup. A custom methodology was used based on investigation, design, implementation and validation to develop this architecture. Design considerations, usefulness, limitations are analyzed and discussed. Overall effectiveness of the architecture in search and rescue missions was found a future work for improvement has been established.",

The results obtained through this model of sustainable development show that it is not only possible to control the natural resources of water and soil by creating an alert called reserve margin, but also it is possible to maximize investments in social, environmental or economic projects, previously prioritized through the “citizen factor”, so that they certainly respond to the needs or expectations of the community involved.",

    "abstract": "There are many business routine tasks and processes which are performed by qualified resources which can be reallocated, allowing qualified workers to dedicate their effort to other fields/tasks with more relevance. With Robotic Process Automation (RPA), repetitive tasks, even complex computer routine processes, can be automated and improved, independently of the interface or menu location.This paper proposes an RPA application, which in real-time, dynamically detects objects in software applications interface, allowing flexibility, performance, and accuracy regardless of the OS, location of interface tools, and necessary menus to reach it. For this purpose, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is trained with several interfaces and menus and used to classify software interfaces in real-time. Furthermore, a developed software takes automated actions, moving the mouse pointer, clicking, editing text, and performing any necessary action. Results show that the proposed RPA technique based on deep learning is capable of detecting objects in real-time, classify them, with outstanding accuracy, and take dynamic actions. This way, it is possible to automate any computer task.",

This means that the system should respond correctly in presence of failures, which are quite probable in a distributed, largely independent, system as cloud systems are. Thus, it is important that cloud systems become fault tolerant, ensuring safe recovery from failures. Since failures in clouds may come from several different sources, although a major role comes from communication failures, the techniques that can be applied to assure reliability are also very different. This survey presents a systematic review of solutions to provide fault tolerance in open source clouds. Our goal with this review is to provide to cloud managers a guided approach to choose a solution for a given problem or system.",

In this article, we present a performance benchmark of three different video streaming protocols, RTMP, RTSP and HLS, in mobile networks. This evaluation focuses on three aspects: stability, mobile device battery life and resource consumption (CPU, RAM). The evaluation is carried out in the city of Guaranda in Ecuador, in this city the coverage of mobile networks is very variable, starting with the 4G network that does not have much coverage and the rest of the city uses between 3G and 2G, that makes the coverage along the city very changeable, which is optimal to carry out the proposed evaluation. The result was that the best protocol that can be used currently for mobile networks for the City of Guaranda, is the HLS, delivering a balance between the 3 points analyzed and the best performance.",

Such technology consists of a set of equipments and protocols designed to provide the means to determine the position of aircraft in flight from embedded navigation systems, as well as to periodically broadcast information of interest to other aircrafts en route and sensors on the ground within your range. However, serious security vulnerabilities lie at the heart of the ADS-B protocol, and the literature is unclear about the impact of exploitations in these breaches on the direct action of Air Traffic Controllers and aircraft pilots. This article aims to take an analytical look at the vulnerabilities present in the ADS-B system, not only when mapping attacks to that protocol, but also when seeking to identify, analyze, evaluate and classify the risks inherent to operational security through the GRSO method, focusing on the impact upon the Air Traffic Controllers decision- making process.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review mapped studies on the use of Instagram in the field of public health, with an emphasis on the performance of government entities. Twenty-six papers were selected from SCOPUS and PUBMed databases, from 13 countries. The eligibility requirements were texts in English or Portuguese, published between 2015 and 2019, in open access journals. The works pointed out Instagram as a health promotion tool with the ability to involve users, mainly for its imagery appeal. The studies classified the performance of public health entities in this network as inefficient. Establishing dialogue with citizens and action planning are good practices suggested to change this scenario. Studies on health mediation on Instagram have not been located for profiles with low connectivity level, such as the elderly and the population of developing countries. In focus is discussed visibility control of public health actors in the network by private stakeholders, using social media owners. It is concluded that the presence of governmental health actors on Instagram is necessary, due to the global growth of this social media and its use for different approaches in health.",

It is a reflection on the implementation of a pilot program called Mentoring Academy in degree courses of a Portuguese public higher education institution. The main aim of the program is to support the integration of young undergraduates in higher education and help them overcome difficulties. This paper contributes to achieving the aims of finding whose help students seek when they have queries regarding the course or institution, the means they use to make such queries, their level of acquaintance with digital platforms, the digital platforms they consider most adequate to their integration in higher education, and the students' level of adaptation to both the institution and the degree course they attend. Among the results, obtained by questionnaire from a sample of 80 subjects, we highlight the following: when they have queries regarding the institution or any curricular contents, undergraduates mostly seek help from their fellow students; they mostly use face to face communication and the institution's platform to make such queries; their level of acquaintance with the institution's platform is high; the most adequate means for their integration in higher education are social networks and the institution's platform; and the undergraduates' level of adaptation to the institution is very high.",

This program needed an application that permits its execution. Motivated by this demand, we aimed at proposing a web application that complies with the Mentoring Academy requirements. The system requirements were defined together with the program stakeholders. Based on the literature review, we opted for the technologies ASP.NET Core and MySQL, for the backend, and Angular 6, for the frontend. Subsequently, the system architecture was planned. SCRUM methodology was used in the application development, with biweekly meetings with the stakeholders to evaluate what was done and to define the efforts for the following fortnight. Eighteen features were developed and four were presented in this paper. Finally, the system was deployed on a Linux server provided by the Instituto Politecnico de Braganca, allowing it to be tested and later used by the Mentoring Academy users. Approximately 61% of the functional requirements defined in the system modeling were developed (23 out of 38) and some functionalities not previously defined were also implemented. The units tests developed for the web application proved promising in terms of components generation and HTTP request services, both exception-free. That said, the system provides students' integration, permitting them to have socio-academic inclusion and support in curricular units.",

In a second stage, this paper also addresses the issue of integration with orchestration platforms hosted in a public cloud (Microsoft Azure). This integration will allow the movement of containers from the local data center to the cloud without having to reconFigure the network infrastructure or the current security policy.",

This paper first begins with a technical description of the ALTO project, and afterwards evaluates how P2P applications, guided by our proposed prototype implementation of the ALTO architecture, perform in comparison to traditional peer selection algorithms on the task of downloading a file in a typical file-sharing P2P network environment. The obtained results from our developed ALTO prototype system state that an application guided by the ALTO solution reduced overall network usage by around 40% with no significant impact in the application performance.",

    "abstract": "Precise and efficient monitoring is vital to ensure that a network works according to the intended behaviour, as well as quickly acting in response to possible problems. The task of monitoring a network becomes complex with increasing network size and its heterogeneity. This work explores the development of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system to monitor network communication infrastructures. All the processes of creation of the system and the existing entities will be described as well as their communication capabilities. Then, the definition of a metalanguage will be exposed, allowing network administrators to conFigure and pre-program the network in an effective and versatile manner. The optimization of the monitoring system will be also described, reducing the traffic generated by the P2P network. It will be also addressed how the system became fault-tolerant, recovering its state even if any entity has a problem.",

It is important to take into account that thanks to these advances there must be circulation models, which facilitate vehicular traffic as well as help with the solution of problems that lead to the use of vehicles in a city. One of the important needs in a city is access to the health and well-being of its citizens, which with the help of an appropriate model will allow for a reduction in the time it takes to access the primary health needs that a patient must have in times of emergency.

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a technological architecture that supports the remote medical care service for elderly people suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Peru. The problem is based on the limitations that elderly people have with compliance with medical controls, which leads to increased complications of the disease and the patient's quality of life. The design of the technological architecture is based on 6 layers: 1) devices, 2) software, 3) channels, 4) data storage, 5) data processing and 6) information visualization. Through the solution, patients are able to autonomously manage their disease through periodic glucose control and the execution of an updated treatment in real time. In the same way, the specialist doctor periodically analyzes the glucose level and it is notified in real time about the out-of-range indicators, which allows him to make treatment decisions as the anomaly occurs. The focus of the solution is to reduce the complications generated by the disease through efficient glucose control and periodic medical advice. The solution was validated in a nursing home with adults over 60 and an endocrinologist from a medical office in Lima, Peru. For the study, we measured the constancy of the glucose record, the average response time of the doctor in case of emergencies or indicators out of range, the percentage of reduction of complications and the level of satisfaction of the Telehomecare solution in older adults. The results show that patients interact more frequently as they adapt the solution as part of their daily routine. On the other hand, the response time was approximately 4.13 minutes from the anomaly record. The percentage of complication reduction was 14% and the level of satisfaction of the solution was reflected in the dimensions of the response time and understanding of the user's need.",

Organizations are focusing on redesigning and automating their major processes, according to a report published in 2018 [1]. In this way, a challenge n process mining is to show the results of the process analysis in a way that is understandable to non-expert users. Therefore, this research paper introduces a matrix of guidelines to guide process mining specialists/tool developers to improve the results of the analysis in process mining projects. This matrix is composed of 2 study fields that throughout the literature have been merging their virtues. First, process mining under 2 of its 3 types of projects: (1) based on objectives and (2) based on questions. The last type is based on data (exploratory analysis). Second, visualization of data with its techniques to represent data graphically. This research proposes a matrix of guidelines that integrates the discipline of process mining and the set of data visualization techniques based on the purpose of each graph (technique), the question / objective to be achieved and the importance that colors take in the analysis results in the process mining projects.",

These sensors collect the pressure distribution on the walker's handle and the speed of the steps during therapy session. The proposal allows to improve the traditional physiotherapy session times through a mobile application to perform the monitoring controlled by a health specialist in real time. The proposed solution consists of 4 stages: 1. Obtaining gear parameters, 2. Data transmission, 3. Information Storage and 4. Data collection and processing. Solution was tested with 10 patients from a physical rehabilitation center in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results revealed a significant reduction in the rehabilitation session from 25 to 5.2 minutes.",

According to studies by Ernst & Young, 90% of companies in Peru are not prepared to detect security breaches, and 51% have already been attacked. In addition, according to Deloitte, only 10% of companies maintain risk management indicators. The model consists of 3 phases: 1. Inventory the information assets of the company, to conduct the risk analysis of each one; 2. Evaluate treatment that should be given to each risk, 3. Once the controls are implemented, design indicators to help monitor the implemented safeguards. The article focuses on the creation of a model that integrates a standard of risk management across the company with a standard of IS indicators to validate compliance, adding as a contribution the results of implementation in a specific environment. The proposed model was validated in a pharmaceutical SME in Lima, Peru. The results showed a 71% decrease in risk, after applying 15 monitoring and training controls, lowering the status from a critical level to an acceptable level between 1.5 and 2.3, according to the given assessment.",

Tools that have contributed to the analysis of fields in which massive amounts of data are available is \"data mining\", a powerful tool that can be used effectively in the analysis of large amounts of data and in the subsequent derivation of important analytical results. This paper presents a methodology of analysis of crime facts from online newspapers, identifying the different communes where the greatest number of criminal events occur, which gives an idea of potentially more dangerous places, through the detection and geographical mapping of critical points, or the analysis of the nature of the crime through the extraction of entities. Statistics that measure the predictive capacity of the model indicate that the methodology is robust to recognize crime events within the body of the news.",

This study intends to present a new aspect to the model, Characteristics Assessment, centered on the concept of competence management. The strand is organized in two dimensions of analysis: Skills and Entrepreneurship. The MISC Model (Monitoring Indicators for Successful Carrer) is aimed at three business actors (target audience), teacher, in monitoring the skills of the teacher their professional activities in the organization, student, in collecting their feedback after the end of the class, and market, collection of feedback from companies in order to value the performance of the teacher in the entrepreneurship dimension. Our intention is that the MISC is an assessment tool with the aim of informing the organization about the performance of its talents, the teachers in achieving the goals established by the organization, and on the other hand informing the teachers about their professional performance on the day daily in order to enhance their performance and thereby enhance their personal brand in the organization.",

Las organizaciones deben invertir en la implementación de procedimientos de medición que permitan reducir el esfuerzo del conteo y mantener un nivel aceptable en la exactitud de las mediciones. En trabajos previos evaluamos una herramienta para la medición del tamaño funcional IFPUG FPA de aplicaciones modeladas en el marco de trabajo para desarrollo de software FastWorks. En esta investigación validamos una propuesta de estimación temprana que obtiene el tamaño funcional a partir de modelos simplificados de FastWorks. La organización requiere obtener las mediciones a partir de los modelos simplificados que les permita reducir el esfuerzo requerido para estimar el tamaño funcional de las aplicaciones por desarrollar. Para determinar la efectividad de la propuesta analizamos los resultados de la medición automatizada de seis modelos desarrollados con el marco de trabajo. Asimismo, comparamos la exactitud y el tiempo de modelado con los obtenidos a partir de los modelos completos. Los resultados indican que la medición basada en los modelos simplificados puede obtener una exactitud similar a la obtenida con los modelos completos, invirtiendo un tercio del tiempo requerido para el modelado. La variabilidad de las mediciones entre modelos osciló entre 0.0% y 3.2% basado en los puntos de función sin ajustar. Los resultados proveen evidencia sobre la viabilidad de la propuesta de estimación temprana para la organización.",

This turns almost a requirement, the need to understand how it works and what the challenges of digital content curation are. This article aims to present the results of the application of an exploratory questionnaire conducted with five stakeholders who are or should be part of the digital content curation process, totaling a sample of 28 respondents from different regions of Brazil. The results show that there is still lack of knowledge about the applicability of the concept of digital curation in education and a constant concern about the quality requirements, updating and teaching skills necessary for curating activity. These results reinforce the importance of the creation of a digital curation quality reference model for Higher Education, which is part of an ongoing PhD research that used the results of the exploratory questionnaire to create data collection instruments with greater depth.",

Existing MBT tools support the automation of this process at varying degrees. One such tool is MBT4J, a research platform that extends ModelJUnit, offering a high level of automation. We extended MBT4J with two graph-based algorithms: the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of these two new algorithms added to MBT4J by comparing them to previous algorithms implemented in the platform. A case study was conducted using two open-source Java applications from public repositories, and twenty-one different configurations. The CPP tester performed similarly to previous testers in terms of time and coverage, and in addition, it resulted in a greater percentage of failed test cases in one application. The BFS tester was able to generate a greater amount of test cases when using fewer resources. We thus recommend using these algorithms for generating test cases for systems with complex models.",

However, Tanzanian higher education institutions have for long been using off-the-shelf timetable software, whose inherent limitations are more likely to constrain decision-making process. It is in this light that this study was conducted to explore challenges faced by higher education institutions in the Tanzanian context on the use of the timetabling data for decision making support while ensuring manageable timetabling process for improved decision making. A mixed method strategy was adopted, in which a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire and semi-structured interview were used for data collection. The interview data were analyzed thematically and different themes were formed, whereas, quantitative data were analyzed for descriptive statistics and a t-test. The analyses show that most of the respondents considered timetable data very important in proper timetabling process and decision-making. Furthermore, the t-test shows that both students and lecturers think that the integration of timetabling software to their information system will solve most of their timetabling problems $(\\mathrm{p}\\gt0.001)$. As a result, this study proposes a timetabling architecture to aid higher education institutions in Tanzanian context in improving their timetabling process for better decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The problem of data privacy on the internet takes on a large proportion considering that personal databases are a source of economic value for companies, which leads to an ethical and legal discussion. This article aims to examine privacy, addressing the issue of Cookies, used to obtain personal information from users for targeted advertising, even when there is no user consent, or such is compromised due to lack of information or knowledge. The article questions whether the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is being violated through this increasingly common practice of Digital Marketing. The methodology used was qualitative, descriptive and bibliographic, based on the GDPR and on articles on that matter. It was concluded that internet users are highly vulnerable regarding their personal data and that companies' digital marketing should be guided by the GDPR rules on the obtainment of Cookies for targeted advertising, which requires greater inspection over its compliance.",

    "abstract": "Guard@Lis application was developed to ease the birdwatching activity. The main purpose was to support the discovery and identification of bird species along a trail, encouraging the preservation and protection of nature. To create a new bird observation perspective since augmented reality features were developed to enhance the experience of birdwatching, ensuring the chance to watch even the most elusive birds. Adding animated 3D models of some birds allows the observation of these species that, for several reasons, may not be easy to encounter in their natural habitat when the user is making the trail. The solution is composed of a multiplatform app and a back-office. It is prepared to create routes with hotspots and improve the bird species list. This first version was designed with a route in the city of Leiria, having specific points along the way, defined for the observation of certain species. Guard@Lis application intends to encourage the didactic and educational facets, so the whole development process of this application was to create a guide that allows users to be able to identify and list the number of bird species found. At this stage, the app allows its users to trail the main historical and tourist points of Leiria and collect the bird species observed.",

    "abstract": "Noise pollution has a material impact on occupational health and well-being. The most significant effects of environmental noise are associated with speed quality and productivity. Furthermore, some studies also connect environmental noise related to an increase in the arterial pressure. Therefore, the environmental noise is a critical challenge for public health, and sound supervision must be applied inside buildings since people typically spend most of their time indoors. Real-time sound monitoring enables the creation of a significant dataset for the decision-making on possible interventions for enhanced occupational health. This paper presents an Internet of Things approach for real-time sound supervision. The main contribution is to present a cost-effective solution composed by a cyber-physical system for data collection and web software for data visualization. The proposed method is designed using open-source technologies and Wi-Fi communication. The system has been tested inside buildings in a continuous form, and the results show that mean sound values range from 41,9 dBA and 46,7 dBA.",

This paper presents the main results relating the student’s perception about an IoT based learning environment supported on an IoT device and a set of didactic guides. The IoT device was developed with low cost and open technology. Complementarily to the device development, a visual guidebook was created to facilitate the device construction by teachers and students, even if they do not have prior knowledge about the use of IoT technologies. Along with the device assembly guide, interdisciplinary didactic guides were also developed to be used in learning tasks. The results obtained demonstrate that teens involved in the study expressed a desire to continue to use the device in their classes and that it was a stimulating and facilitating factor for learning.",

Therefore, it is essential to carry out this systematic review in order to identify the methodologies used to create serious games, the choice of the game engine and the criteria that must be considered for choosing the tool. The methodology used is based on the protocol defined by Barbara Kitchenham, 27 studies from 2013 published in various conferences and magazines were analyzed. The conclusion is that Unity or Unreal are the most used engines, the methodology to follow depends a lot on the nature of the project, being SUM the best option to be used, it should be noted that other authors have chosen to use their own methodologies, and finally to choose A game engine must take into account the basic components and features.",

The project includes the exploration of the state of the art and technique on Emotional Intelligence, children with disabilities such as autism and architecture models for the design of inclusive software applications. All this is validated through qualitative and quantitative metrics and analyzes with evaluation indicators on appropriation or strengthening of emotional abilities in autistic children. The tools considered are: instruments for collecting non-invasive information, filming activities and analyzing emotions through recognition of facial expressions. Finally, the result of the heuristic evaluation of the application of inclusive computational tools within the treatment of Autism is presented, in addition to a conceptual proposal of a scheme for the design of inclusive computational applications, which could be complemented and validated in the future as a product of strengthening of expected skills (intrapersonal skills (motivation) and social skills).",

    "abstract": "Medical images are used to analyze and diagnose diseases. The analysis of these diseases requires images with high contrast and detail, because they contain important information about the disease. Capture methods are improving every day, but sometimes the quality of medical images is not adequate to make a good medical diagnosis. Some common problems are ambient noise, poor lighting conditions, or technical limitations of the devices generating low quality medical images. For these cases, contrast enhancement techniques, which enhance the visual quality of the images, are generally useful. However, there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to improve the contrast and detail of medical images. This proposal is based on a multiscale morphological approach that uses two structuring elements in the top-hat transform. The simulations were performed with medical images taken from public repositories. The experimental results show that the proposal enhances local contrast and improves the details of the medical images.",

In addition to these common applications, the company also uses specialized applications. The specialized applications consist of the specific functionalities and they are used for support of the working activities of the limited group of users. These applications are for a specific company e.g. only one functional role when this role is necessary for running the organization, but it is also represented by only one or two workers. The development of those specific applications is not interesting for ordinary software companies, because such applications are wanted by a very small amount of potential users. The sharing of the specialized applications is possible by the workers with the same functional role in different organizations. However, specialized functional roles do not have to have the same conditions. The article describes the suggestion for the procedure of how to share the specialized applications based on incremental access.",

Our data analysis results yields three main observations (i) Regarding bicying service, the highest usage of bikes is observed to be during morning and evening rush hours as well as weekdays which shows that bicying service is mostly used by work commuters. (ii) Regarding air quality measurements, the analysis results indicate that Observatori Fabra has the highest air quality whereas the district of Eixample has the poorest air quality among the considered districts of Barcelona and high air pollution are observed during weekdays due to heavy morning rush traffic. (iii) Regarding the relation between bikes service usage and air quality, the correlation between bicycing usage and air quality levels is observed to be low.",

Active methodologies and student-centered instruction can be a solution to get students interested on the subject, preparing assignments while learning in the classroom. This article reports on two very different experiences in two academic years. In the first year, agile SCRUM methodology, groups of five students, three interactions and a final project were used. In the second year, the Project based Learning was used with groups of three students for two different products, changing the composition of the groups. In both cases, peer classification was used. The results show that in the first case there is an increase in the approval rate, while in the second case there is an increase in the dropout rate. In this article we make a critical analysis of the results, analyzing what can be beneficial in one experiment and in the other in order to find an ideal model for using active methodologies to teach freshman computer science students how to program.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand in modern industry requires increasingly greater demands on the structural performance of the employed materials and, therefore, it has been seen that is necessary to implement a series of numerical models that allow to adequately predict the mechanical behavior of the materials that are subjected to severe loading conditions. All these numerical models require, as input parameters, the main elastic and plastic behavior coefficients of the materials, which in the case of concrete and steel, are well known parameters that are already tabulated in most materials mechanics texts. In the case of structural masonry, the main parameters for the numerical models are very limited in the state of the art, and they are mostly obtained from laboratory tests of the masonry units, which in many cases do not faithfully represent the structural performance of the raw material that constitutes the unit, mainly due to the confinement generated by the geometry of the units and the different volumetric strain conditions to which the same masonry unit is subjected under the application of a punctual load. In the present research a numerical model by means of finite elements is developed. The model allows to establish a correlation of the linear and nonlinear properties of a hollow block of concrete with the experimental results obtained from a set of uniaxial compression laboratory tests. The results of this research will be used in the future for the analysis of masonry structures, especially the post-tensioned type.",

To this end, we opted for a quantitative research with exploratory descriptive analysis of the data, using a non-probabilistic sample with the application of a questionnaire survey, applied in that city in the months of October and November 2019. Through the empirical results obtained, it can be it is said that of the 250 respondents, 80.8% know the QR Code and 82.4% have used this technology.In general, visitors show a willingness to adopt the QR Code to value cultural goods and monuments by positively agreeing to use it for this purpose, despite the fact that the sample is less frequently used in tourist visits. It was found that the adoption of technologies in tourism can contribute to the local economy, increasing the number of visitors and allowing greater access to information, autonomy and social inclusion for people with disabilities. It was found that this tool of high impact and low cost of implementation is still little available to promote more access to cultural information, curiosities of the place, as well as to enhance cultural monuments in the city of Bragança.",

For this, an exploratory, descriptive and correlational research model was applied. The case study was raised with an experimental group of third-year students from the William Shakespeare Educational School, located in Quito-Ecuador where a new Flipped Classroom pedagogical model was implemented and a control group that worked with the traditional model. As support to the FC model a search or creation of tutorial videos was made by students from their homes and then upload to the Edpuzzle platform. In classes the time was allocated to reinforce, expand and consolidate the knowledge acquired, investing the class and getting the student be the protagonist and responsible for their own learning. The results showed that 90% of the experimental group get grades higher than 9/10; while in the control group only 70% get grades higher than 9/10 which allows to conclude that the FC model has a positive impact on the learning of differential calculus; also a strengthening in the capacity for teamwork, inquiry, commitment to the use of technology and intrinsic values of the human being such as respect for the ideas of their peers, tolerance and self-evaluation of the work developed.",

Simulators are a way of testing the system. Network researchers may use other simulation methods performance like OPNET (optimized Network Engineering Tool), NS-2 (Network Simulator version 2) and NS-3 (Network Simulator Version 3) in addition to many other simulation programs and tools. In this paper, we have used NS-2.35 for simulation. By using different routing protocols, we have measured and compared our results and were able to Figure out throughput, average end delay, PDR, and Nodes energy residual using the Random mobility model. The simulation results showed that the AODV routing protocol has been more efficient in terms of its performance than other routing protocols.",

To estimate the behavior of a modulated bit stream with these Constellations, two metrics were used: the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), and the Probability of bit error. Two possible scenarios for a Communications Channel were considered. The first case corresponds to a Channel with Gaussian White Additive Noise (AWGN), and the second case to an AWGN Channel that has been affected by Fading. Channel simulation was performed based on the statistical models of probability distribution, Gaussian and Rayleigh. The results for each case were obtained with the Monte Carlo method. The performance results of the Conventional QAM Constellations with the results of the Non-Uniform QAM Constellations were compared, and it is determined which of them behave optimally with each value of a wide range of SNR values.",

Under the principles of social constructivism, peer learning seems to be a flexible solution for educational challenges, for encouraging learners' autonomy, engagement and collaboration skills as well as for welcoming the incorporation of innovating strategies and digital technologies. According to literature review, extensive benefits of peer learning have been found under the affective, social, and cognitive dimensions, although more scientific evidence is needed to assess its impact on learners' academic performance. This PhD project tries to provide a valid contribution to the scientific and educational communities, based on finding that the recognized potential of peer learning can be more systematically explored within the realm of teaching and learning practice in basic and secondary education. Under the methodological framework of Educational Design Research, this study aims to develop a digitally enhanced prototype of a peer learning program in the scope of English as a Foreign Language curricula for basic and secondary education and assess the impact of peer teacher students' (PTS) voluntary participation under the cognitive (as for metacognitive skills), affective (regarding motivation), and social dimensions (considering collaborative and communicative skills). Results are expected to find evidence of peer learning positive impact on PTSs' academic performance and facilitate its dissemination.",

For this, a project is developed in which new functionalities are added to a virtual learning platform to allow the detection of student learning styles, and the configuration of courses under ABP methodology (Problem Based Learning). To achieve this, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used. In the development of the article it is shown that the model used to determine learning styles was Kolb, this one was used as input to train a SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) neural network. In this way, the material and problems assignment are customized according to the student characteristics. This article shows the modules that make up the platform and the built-in neural network structure to provide intelligence to the system are shown.",

Thus, the data may be at risk of interception, extraction and even manipulation by third parties. In this work, an algorithm is proposed that could help preserve the privacy of user data in collaborative environments. The development involves an encryption mechanism that does not interfere with the control mechanisms used by the owner, developing a code that blocks unauthorized users. This algorithm demonstrates how several users with a shared key can collaborate and transparently edit a document without displaying the text directly. The application is designed to work on any operating system and its application can be verified for several browsers.",

This paper describes the development process of a psychoeducational intervention called DEEP (Depression among Portuguese University Students), which assists Portuguese University Students with a set of tools to deepen their knowledge of depression as an illness. Psychoeducational intervention DEEP consists of a digital audiovisual narrative in web series format (“Sarah's wound”) and is part of a set of short videos and challenges. The audiovisual content produced on depression literacy is aimed at sensitizing Portuguese University Students in a flexible, pedagogical and interactive way. The intervention was structured based on a mixed approach under the methodological framework of Audiovisual Design and Transmedia Storytelling. The study of impact component will follow a quasi-experimental design. The process related to the development and validation of DEEP intervention, with a pre-test described in this paper, contributed to consolidating knowledge of the potential of digital audiovisual narratives to produce educational and health promotion interventions, in particular regarding depression literacy among younger generation segments of the population.",

Content filtering is based on the user's preferences and interests. Current recommendation systems suffer from the problem of a lack of initial information about new users. This problem, known as the cold-start problem, is present both in existing systems and in new systems, in which any user is a new user. In addition, web application developers find it difficult to integrate recommendation systems into their applications, having to resort to third-party software or develop the recommendation system from scratch. In this work, URecommender is proposed, an API for web recommendation systems composed of a Middleware and a Framework capable of identifying the textual content of greatest interest to the user and recommending relevant related content. Such identification is done implicitly and based on the user's current behavior, which can solve the cold-start problem. In addition, URecommender gives the developer greater control over the recommendation system that will be integrated into the web application under development. The API was used for the development of a real web application and demonstrated good results in the recommendations generated.",

    "abstract": "The availability of electric energy is one of the clearest indicators of economic development in the world. It is used as a sign of economic growth in times when the world demand for electricity is growing at a dizzying pace. Due to the high price of energy and knowing that the environmental problems are becoming increasingly serious, energy consumption is one of the most critical problems that are being addressed globally under different approaches, both academics and from the industry. The following article presents a basis concept for the definition of a prediction model for consumption and power generation using artificial neural networks. In order to implement the model, the data of the daily energy demand of the country Colombia were used from the first of January of the year 2000 until the 30 of December of the year 2017. The obtained model is characterized by having 13 inputs and a hidden layer with 26 neurons, the training algorithm used is Bayesian Regularization. Finally, the results obtained, as well as the conclusions and future work are presented.",

    "abstract": "Many types of scientific and other problems, in industry or academia, can be solved over the Internet, but the use of this computing mode has, in our opinion, been marginal. We present an illustration of such mode by applying it to an illustrative problem in chemical reactions from the literature, which would benefit from this approach. We review the solution of the problem and present it on one of our web pages. Essentially, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes the evolution of a particular reaction is solved and optimized. This is based on a Fortran 90 program executable in a dedicated web page, in PHP. In addition, Matlab and Mathematica scripts are made available. The application runs on the Linux server of the university, as might be of a company, and, in our typical practice, needs no installation or plug-ins on the user's terminal. We thus intend to: provide a public solution to a certain type of problem; supply the above scripts; and advocate the Internet as a convenient computing medium. A number of other problems can be freely solved on the authors' web pages.",

    "abstract": "Quality requirements (also known as non-functional requirements) are those that address the quality of the software. They involve diverse aspects such as availability, security, performance, scalability, portability and usability, among others. Continuous technological advances such as cloud computing or the Internet of Things present new challenges in guaranteeing a satisfactory level of quality in these aspects. Moreover, agile development methodologies, whose use is increasing, such as SCRUM, XP, Kanban, do not provide the necessary support for the management of these quality requirements. To support software engineers when making decisions about the level of quality needed in a project, it is essential to know in advance (1) what criteria will be considered to verify, prioritize, plan, and/or negotiate quality requirements. Likewise, it is necessary to specify (2) how these criteria will be evaluated and (3) what factors in the project context may affect that evaluation. To try to answer these 3 research questions, the authors of this article have designed and are carrying out a systematic literature review. This article presents for discussion the description of the methodology followed in that literature review, as well as some of the preliminary results obtained during its execution.",

Twenty years after the promulgation of the Agile Manifesto, after several years of execution and extensive literature represented in articles, papers in specialized conferences, websites and textbooks, associated with each particular agile methodology; In Puerto Rico it is still unknown what the degree of adoption of the new paradigms is and it is necessary to review more information to guide developers on the benefits of choosing a particular software development based on a methodology, facilitated by the use of tools and using usability criteria throughout the process, all these ideals adjusted to their particular work context. This exploratory study seeks to evaluate, synthesize and present the empirical findings on software development in Puerto Rico (PR), this research is of great importance to know what type of applications are made in the Island, to identify the work methodologies that are used investigate whether agile methods are used, determine the role that users play in the process and analyze how usability techniques adjust to the software life cycle; These aspects are the first step to propose to software developers an integration framework that facilitates their work and allows them to meet the needs of their customers, without compromising the quality of their products.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is being successfully used in many science areas, medicine being no exception. On the other hand, cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of various subtypes and possible treatments that generate a lot of data (Big Data). This study sets out to identify, evaluate and interpret published research that examines how predicting the outcome of treating cancer can benefit from making use of ML. To achieve this, a systematic review of the literature was conducted. This review resulted in finding 1,855 studies, 32 of which were identified as primary studies. They were then classified according to research area and the aspect of ML they focus on. The results show gaps in current research as no studies were identified on ML using Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), a fundamental tool that is used to improve caring for elderly patients with cancer.",

Despite this, the Software Industry does not yet have a clear outlook of how to elicit this type of requirements from the early stages of development. Proposal: Given this problem, the MERliNN Framework was created to support this process of elicitation of NFRs based in knowledge management, which is evolving through the construction of a component for the iconographic representation of NFRs, called NFR-REP. Objective: To present the progress in the construction of the NFR-REP component to represent the NFRs. Method: The Design-science methodology is used to construct the representation component, and semantic analysis to determine the structure and constituent elements of the component. Results: Two elements of the component are defined: (1) the aspects of the NFRs identified from the literature, (2) the strategy to represent the NFRs supported by the theory of semiotics and signs. Conclusions: (1) the methods used for the construction of the component NFR-REP are adequate to guide such construction, (2) the theory of semiotics gives capacity to the component of NFRs representation of address the knowledge problem against NFRs.",

One of the techniques of quality assurance is software testing. The generation of test data sets presents a great challenge for the test activity due to the multiple inputs, combinations of variables and dependence on the environmental information in which the adaptive system is inserted. This research presents an approach, called AGAS, for the generation of test data sets for adaptive systems. AGAS uses the concept of virtual environments, the changes in these environments and the implications of system adaptations and works with the interaction of the control loop of an adaptive system. An experimental study was carried out to compare AGAS with the randomized approach using three assessment metrics. The approach was applied to three examples of adaptive systems. The results obtained showed that there was a considerable gain in the generation of the test data set, occurrences of adaptations and adaptations with errors. AGAS suggest that it is a promising approach to generate test data sets for adaptive systems considering the adaptation criterion.",

    "abstract": "Governments are devoting significant resources to propose strategies that disseminate and exploit into prospective studies. In 2019, the Government of Antioquia (Department located in Colombia) launched a program called “Antioquia 2050”, which it is based on a long-term planning process. It is a rigorous exercise to offer projections to new politicians and their future generations. One of the axes analyzed was education. This article presents a prospective study on virtual education in the Antioquia region (Colombia). The methodology of the study consisted of a participatory and integrative series of techniques mostly used in prospective exercises (panel of experts, Delphi method, scenarios). Some interesting data collected suggested the benefits of virtual platforms, by allowing the educational system to scale up at a lower cost and with greater reach. Evidence found in this research showed that higher education in 20 years would represent a basic and/or minimal condition in Antioquia. The connectivity of the human being with technology will facilitate the incorporation of virtual learning mechanisms from everyday life in a ubiquitous way; at any time and place in their daily lives. The results of this study were shared in the “Summit of wise men (Cumbre de visionarios)”, an event that took place at the end of 2019. Additionally, the study is also part of the research project “Adaptive learning management tool based on problems to enhance collaborative work in virtual courses at university level”, co-financed by Colciencias (Proposal Call 8042018).",

The export volume increases every year, and to maintain these results it is necessary to invest in the modernization and optimization of production processes, as well as, in the classification of raw materials. This study aims to implement a classification model of ornamental rocks through the analysis and classification of images, using machine learning algorithms. The recognition of the type of stone, through the capture of images and subsequent algorithmic analysis, will allow to define quality control scales in future processes, taking into account the different types of stone. In addition, it will also allow to develop models capable of helping in reducing the amount of raw material wasted. This work presents the steps taken to create a classification model, using a dataset of 2260 images distributed over four classes, three of which are very similar to color level and one with a different tone. In this study, the results of the application of three automatic classification algorithms are analyzed. In addition, a discussion of how types of images can improve results and the execution times of algorithms are presented.",

The methodology used was centered on the study of the organization, on the literature review of the theme and international standards. The contributions of the approach seek to optimize the established management practices and the continuous improvement of ICT processes in the context of the organization.

These processes demand time, constant accompaniment and appropriate decisions made by the health professional, as well as a fundamental aspect, which is the motivation of the patient. This work presents a proposal for the development of a telerehabilitation platform which involves the use of serious video games, a motion capture system and a web application in order to support the recovery process of the musculoskeletal system. To begin with, this work presents a review of the literature that addresses aspects related to the rehabilitation of the upper limbs, using videogames and motion capture systems. The review identified that the use of video games continues to represent a significant contribution to motor rehabilitation processes, and that the main motion capture systems used are Kinect, some commercial systems, and other proposals that explore the advantages of the units of inertial measurement. Then, the methodological process leading to the development of a platform is put forward. Finally, there is a description of the basic characteristics of the functioning and the structure of the telerehabilitation platform proposed in order to offer a precise and motivating alternative as treatment.",

    "abstract": "The accelerated advance of Information Technologies (IT) has led organizations facing new challenges in IT governance, as key elements for corporate strategy. A clear example is the decision-making regarding the acquisition, adoption, or implementation of technological platforms, where managers should consider whether they make large investments in software, training, and workforce. For this reason, it is important to be sure that the platform that is being used and the project types are being carried out, do correspond to the true vocation and profile of the organization. However, the proliferation of platforms and their heterogeneity increase the uncertainty in these decisions. This article presents a framework to identify the IT profile of a project or an organization, based on six defined categories: Software development, Platform integration, Business process management, Internet of things, Data analytics, and Open ecosystems of Artificial Intelligence. As an evaluation of the framework, an application case is presented in a company in the health area, within a technological project aimed at improving customer service throughout its area of influence (Colombia). We apply experimental instruments to identify the dominant profiles by units of the company and the roles representativeness involved.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, in engineering careers, it is necessary to carry out activities that allow evaluation of the training process based on professional skills. This implies generating mechanisms that enable the assessment of learning based on quantitative and qualitative criteria from which competence levels of learning are defined. In this sense, it is necessary to arbitrate the means to determine performance of students before real or simulated activities of the future professional context. In this work, authors propose an ontological model as part of the design of a software. It involves the definition of the evaluation activities for the learning process based on competencies in engineering careers, such as definition of level of domain indicators, criteria and evidence determination, weights and scores specification, which accredit professional performance and stimulate the necessary feedback to complete this process. In this way, authors seek to collaborate with professors, academic management staff and other university actors who want to improve the quality of learning through new educational paradigms such as learning by competencies, since carrying out an appropriate evaluation is a task pending in education in general, and in the training of engineers in particular, mainly because of its complexity.",

It has been used in a multi factor authentication to increase the information security during the authentication process. However factors like what you have cause an inconvenience to the users, because the users during the authentication process always will need to have a device in their possession that complements the authentication process. By the other side of the biometric factor might change during the time, it needs an auxiliary device that will increase the costs and it also might be dependent from environmental conditions to work appropriately. To avoid some problems that exist in multi factor authentication, this work purposes authentication through semantic representation in OWL (web Ontology Language) tuples of recognized concepts in images as a form to increase the security in the authentication process. A proof of the concept was modeled and implemented, it has a demonstration that the robustness of this authentication system depends on the complexity of relationship in the semantic base (ontology) and in the simplicity of the relationship identified in the images.",

The execution of the search protocol that focused on papers published between 2004 and 2019, 17 papers were obtained from two online databases. The selected papers present information about the application of accessibility features that were tested in a minimum viable product applied to people with visual impairments. As a result, it was found that most papers focus on navigation systems, which is a feature used in most digital games, and all of them make use of sound effects. In most of the researched papers, audio is the main instrument to assist the visually impaired player. The development features presented in the systematic review can serve as a basis for developers in the field. Finally, there is still little content in the literature on accessible features available in the context of digital games, which makes it an indispensable research field to explore.",

The following article presents a proposal for the construction of a simulation model for the system of internationalization of higher education in Colombia based on systems dynamics. The main characteristics that represent the system were then started and, by means of a causal hypothesis, the variables were gathered in four dimensions. The dimensions that were taken into account were: the global education system, the global higher education institutions, the global territories, and the global citizens. The design of the hypothesis, through system dynamics, allows representing the interactions in each of the dimensions, which finally facilitated the vision of the system as a whole. One of the main results was the dynamic hypotheses which, in turn, allow the construction of the flow and a level diagram for the realization of a computational simulation model. Under this simulation scheme, a novel tool is then proposed for decision-makers regarding the evaluation of the impact of internationalization on the different substantive functions of higher education institutions and the formulation of public policies in this type of system.",

It is hoped that, using open government data for scientific research purposes, the public good and social justice might be enhanced. Taking into account the European General Data Protection Regulation recently adopted, the big challenge in Portugal and other European countries, is how to provide the right balance between personal data privacy and data value for research. This work presents a sensitivity study of data anonymization procedure applied to a real open government data available from the Brazilian higher education evaluation system. The ARX k-anonymization algorithm, with and without generalization of some research value variables, was performed. The analysis of the amount of data / information lost and the risk of re-identification suggest that the anonymization process may lead to the under-representation of minorities and sociodemographic disadvantaged groups. It will enable scientists to improve the balance among risk, data usability, and contributions for the public good policies and practices.",

Classic top-hat transform is a mathematical morphological operation that is used in contrast enhancement and images fusion. But this operation introduces saturations into the image enhancement process. Therefore, a generalization of the top-hat transform using two structuring elements is proposed. This variation allows to decrease the saturations in the images processed. Also, this variation is tested in new algorithms based on multiscale mathematical morphology applied to contrast enhancement of medical, infrared and visible images and in a new algorithm based on multiscale mathematical morphology for visible and infrared images fusion. The results obtained show medical, infrared, visible and fused images with contrast enhancement and detail improvement.",

Such models are important to ensure customer satisfaction and quality analysis of business processes in the production of a system. Given this context, this research aims to present the implementation of the MPT.br (in the first two maturity levels) in a telecommunications company in Brazil to present the benefits of defining the software test process according to a maturity model. To achieve the research goal, we are using a research method called action-research, which is based on empirical studies in software engineering. As results, we expect that this deployment in the company will contribute to a significant improvement in its testing processes, thus contributing to the improvement of the entire organization.",

For this, a three-phase predictive analysis model was designed which was combined with the stages proposed by the IBM SPSS Modeler methodology. Bayesian network techniques was compared with decision trees for their level of accuracy over other algorithms in an Educational Data Mining (EDM) scenario. Data were collected from 500 undergraduate students from a private university in Lima. The results indicate that Bayesian networks behave better than decision trees based on metrics of precision, accuracy, specificity, and error rate. Particularly, the accuracy of Bayesian networks reaches 67.10% while the accuracy for decision trees is 61.92% in the training sample for iteration with 8:2 rate. On the other hand, the variables athletic person (0.30%), own house (0.21%), and high school grades (0.13%) are the ones that contribute most to the prediction model for both Bayesian networks and decision trees.",

    "abstract": "Due to limitations in tax administrations, such as: staff, tools, time, etc., tax administrations seek to recover debts in the early stages of control, where the cost of collection is lower than in the subsequent stages. This work proposes a framework based on deep learning techniques to predict debts of taxpayers with high probability of non-payment in a short period of time. A group of debts of a tax administration was used to generate the model to estimate the risk of non-payment. A concordance index metric was used to measure the performance. The performance obtained was 90%.",

    "abstract": "For better usage of idle resources in a symmetric multiprocessing environment, cloud computing providers often exploit the boundaries of parallelism by imposing high CPU subscription rates over their virtualization systems. Moreover, unsuitable resource allocation can significantly impair the performance during intensive workloads and increase infrastructure expenditures unnecessarily. It becomes an increasing challenge when dealing with microservices architecture and container encapsulated applications, for these are approaches that add more intricacy layers to the workload scheduling over the hardware. This paper presents a case study on a public agency private cloud, which aims to evaluate the performance of hypervisors and virtual machines, that are serving a Kubernetes container orchestration cluster and running a microservices-based Payroll System during CPU-bound behavior tasks. We also propose a model for sizing the virtual environment according to the best choices for the hardware characteristics and the workload needs.",

    "abstract": "Small software development companies require for their process management of their software processes proposals specific to their context, in order to they can improve in their daily work. This article presents a certification model for compliance requirements based on the ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 standard (analogously to that made for the ISO 9001 or ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO/IEC 20001 certifications) for supporting to small software development organizations interested in ensuring the software product quality through processes improvement and certification. A pilot project has been carried out to determine the suitability of the model proposed put in practice, which had as scope the defined processes by the company that were related to project management and software implementation. On these two processes, this company has satisfied the requirements established by the model for obtaining the certification in ISO/IEC 29110. From this application it can be evidenced that the proposed model is economical for the implementation of the standard and for its certification audit, given that: (i) it is limited only to two processes that all companies carry out when they develop software, (ii) the reference model establishes the “must be” (requirements) of the two proposed processes, which are those that must be satisfied, and (iii) the certification by conformity of process requirements is less complex, and therefore less expensive, than other certification schemes (such as, for example, process assessment schemes).",

It is true that there are devices that already read information, but are intended exclusively for the mining sector and are very expensive. That is why we propose to model and validate a new system for other industrial sectors. Our proposal, The Gas Detection System is based on The Explosive Discussion Triangle method developed by Coward and Jones. We use this method to develop a control system that will allow gas concentrations to be detected in a given environment and send an alarm if a risk situation arises. Formal Specifications allows the use of mathematical notations that help in the process of implementing critical systems and helps to reduce the potential ambiguities that occur in the interpretation of traditional graphic models. This work uses the VDM ++ formal specification language to describe system properties for its subsequent modeling and validation through the VDMToolBox tool. The System architecture is based on sensors, a control module and a set of alarms. Our proposal makes use of formal specifications in order to validate the main properties of the functional requirements.",

    "abstract": "Index structures are fast-access methods. In the past, they were often used to minimise fetch operations to external storage devices (secondary memory). Nowadays, this also holds for increasingly large amounts of data residing in main-memory (primary memory). Examples of software that deals with this fact are in-memory databases and mobile device applications. Within this scope, this paper focuses on index structures to store, access and delete interval-based time-dependent (temporal) data from very large datasets, in the most efficient way. Index structures for this domain have specific characteristics, given the nature of time and the requirement to index time intervals. This work presents an open-source time-efficiency focused variant of the original Interval B+ tree. We designate this variant Improved Interval B+ tree (I2B+ tree). Our contribution adds to the performance of the delete operation by reducing the amount of traversed nodes to access siblings. We performed an extensive analysis of insert, range queries and deletion operations, using multiple datasets with growing volumes of data, distinct temporal distributions and tree parameters (time-split and node order). Results of the experiments validate the logarithmic performance of these operations and propose the best-observed tree parameter ranges.",

The evolution in the information and communication technology systems has brought many challenges related to operational, strategic and management paradigms. For one side, not only do this, the police benefit themselves from improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and economy procedures, as well as, the citizen benefits from more simplified and faster treatment. For the other side, the introduction of the artificial intelligence by the police will get information faster in the fight against crime and it can act effectively and efficiently. Methodologically, this article focuses on a literature review with the main focus on how artificial intelligence applied can be a very important complement from the perspective of management, as well as an exploratory analysis of the systems already applied, reflecting good practices in the field of forces police officers used in the different services and police forces in a comparative way. The result of the investigation shows the importance of AI in the criminal sphere, where it is possible to use this tool as a preventive measure that guides police and criminal justice decisions and strategies.

    "abstract": "Cloud Computing is arguably the most significant technological development after the Internet. It accelerated technology adoption and gave birth to new business models. More importantly, it is acting as a foundation for new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Cloud Computing paradigm provides a level playing field for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as they are able to adopt technologies that were not affordable before. Governments, vendors and business support organisations across the world have a plethora of initiatives to encourage SME adoption of Cloud Computing technologies. Despite these initiatives, many SME decision makers are still hesitant to adopt the cloud. This research reports an engagement with 16 information technology (IT) managers working for Saudi manufacturing SMEs. This paper presents their perceived barriers to migrating their applications to cloud services.",

    "abstract": "A proper architectural design for a microservices system is crucial for its success. Although there are several design strategies to identify software components in general, microservices demands special consideration. In this context of distributed systems, the component size directly impacts on nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, flexibility, reusability, etc. Design practices of coupling and cohesion have to be fine-tuned to determine the ideal microservices granularity. In order to shed light on this question, this study conducted a Systematic Literature Review that investigates microservices identification proposals. From procedures and guidelines inspired by Kitchenham et al., a rigorous research protocol was defined and performed, that covers publications from 2013 to 2019. Starting with an initial screening of 715 papers, 27 studies were considered relevant to answer four research questions. Besides microservices decomposition strategies, this review underlines Model Driven Engineering and Domain Driven Design, once they represent valuable approaches to support this challenging task. Moreover, this work highlights that only a few studies had explored these approaches in their strategies, which opens promising potential for further research.",

    "abstract": "Portuguese culture embodies a wealth of artisanal heritage of high symbolic and historical value. Manual arts still prevail, but with every passing generation, fears of their eventual extinction grow. The growing scarcity of resources, the disinterest of the youngest and the difficulty of adopting digital media are seen as the main causes for concern, contributing to the ebbing away of many age-old industrial techniques, traditions, and practices. The research project \"Anti-Amnesia\", aims, through design, to contribute to the revitalization of this industry through digital technology as a means of dissemination and monetization. This paper presents a component of the project part that is dedicated to the experimental development of an online premise for catering to the needs of the craft sector, including an embedded marketplace. This market consists of a digital platform, where retailers have a space and tools, where they can promote and sell their products.",

    "abstract": "The information generated from Smart Meters in advanced measurement infrastructure (AMI) in a Smart Grid, needs real-time data acquisition and processing, this could generate high redundancy of data in an uplink in the communication network compared to the number of smart meters in a city. In this sense, the application of Compressive Sensing (CS) can improve the efficiency in the transfer of data and reduce a possible overload in the system. However, it is necessary to establish the minimum conditions required for the use of CS for data related to the Electrical Energy Consumption Profile. Thus, this article presents the analysis of the use of CS as a source compression method to reduce the data to be transmitted on a network. So, in order to evaluate the quality of the load profile reconstruction using CS despite the transformations that the data undergoes in a real wireless communication system, this technique has been implemented on a Software Defined Radio System (SDR). For this, the measurement matrix implemented with Gauss and Bernoulli distributions is analyzed. The algorithms for the reconstruction are: OMP (Paired orthogonal search), BP (Base search) and GPSR (Gradient Projection Sparse Recovery) in different compression ratios (10 - 80%). It also shows the comparison of errors generated in the uses for the representation of signals in the Gaussian campaign, the DCT transform, the Wavelet Meyer transform and Wavelet Biorthogonal 3.9.",

This development will guarantee a safe, reliable and modern industrial control system that will facilitate the operation of the equipment, in turn reducing the time lost in production by minimizing the late identification of faults and improving the reliability and safety of the machine. The motivation originated from the lack of spare parts in the market for the replacement of communication components damaged due to obsolescence and in units that have had more than 20 years of operation. With the implementation of the proposal, it was possible to reduce the average steam consumption by 1400 kg/shift, which is equivalent to 10.86% less steam used per shift generating a decrease in operating costs, demonstrating that the new control loops allow finer adjustments, which was not the case with the old controllers.",

The results obtained showed energy inefficiency in Portuguese housing buildings, with approximately 44% of them classified with energy certification D, E, and F. We created a scenario with the goal of raising these homes to at least energy classification C, as recommended by the study carried out by the Committee on Climate Change of the United Kingdom.

    "abstract": "To ensure transparency and provide ways for analysis and auditing of various public activities and expenditures, the Complementary Law 131, known as the \"Transparency Law,\" requires the Union, States, and Cities to disclose their expenses in real-time through Internet. However, despite the apparent progress in opening data in Brazil, applications do not follow the various recommended models. Since this data is mostly unconnected, a clear view of the underlying contexts of a query becomes impossible. Thus, there is no clear relationship between recorded expenditure data for education, quality indicators, and/or descriptive census data. The following research sought to create relations between data from the Brazilian Federal Government Open Data Portal and the primary education quality indicator, IDEB, in the cities of the state. The methodology used was Data Mining, a research field resulting from the intersection between the areas of Computer Science and statistics, which seeks to discover non-trivial information hidden in large data. Using Correlation and Linear Regression in the collected and formatted data, it was not found linear relationship, indicating that only cities funding data is not sufficient to obtain a causal relationship with the IDEB average for municipalities. The statistical result found, although it does not provide a direct correlation between the variables investigated, represents a relevant scientific finding in the non-causal relationship itself. The more relevant contribution of this research is the process of selection, preprocessing, and transformation of the data scattered in different information sources and different formats of the analyzed data, as well as the originality of the analyzed causality.",

The success or failure of an audit depends on several factors: the IT auditor, based on their knowledge and experience, chooses expertise, tools and methodologies, each of these elements. Incorrect selection of these components may result in subjective audit results and financial losses for the organization. For this, an analysis of computer audit methodologies was proposed, to determine the level of inherent risk that its application would imply. We worked with our own research methodology of quantitative exploratory type, based on the deductive method for selection of parameters related to inherent risk, with a critical perspective for the quantification and interpretation of statistical data. The research was validated with the Delphi method, through surveys with non-comparative scales, applied to expert auditors to confirm the objectivity and impartiality of the evaluation model. The procedures performed demonstrated that it is possible to quantify the level of inherent risk, through occurrence, compliance and prioritization tables. The analysis of the occurrence of parameters associated with the inherent risk will be transparent and impartial to maintain the integrity of the analysis performed.",

    "abstract": "Health education is very important to raise awareness about the dangers of excessive exposure to the sun, and other climatic elements, especially for more sensitive groups of people such as children. Although there are many known benefits of sun exposure to human health, it is also true that, when in excess, it can also raise the risk of diseases related to exposure to these elements. It is, therefore, important to have monitoring mechanisms to keep children safe from health risks that may arise from exposure to those climatic elements. This work describes the development of a wearable device that monitors some parameters associated with health and conditions to which a child may be exposed and, depending on these conditions, it alerts to the risk to which the child is exposed. The strengths of the described system, regarding children's health, focus not only on the warnings that the changing colours of the light alert will provide them with, as to UV solar radiation, body temperature and ambient temperature, it also improves knowledge about the promotion of health and protection measures to be adopted, considering the conditions to which the child is exposed. For adults, the prototype also reveals some interest, according to the responses to the surveys, and advantageous in that it can help them in the constant monitoring of their children. But, above all, it makes it possible to raise awareness of the importance of health care, especially with children.",

There are more efficient ways for describing actions in terms of attribute-value pairs than production rules. In this way, decision trees constitute a simpler alternative decision structure. A decision tree fits a KB if it strictly respect the description of the actions in terms of the attributes just like the rules of the KB do. This paper describes a method to discover qualitative knowledge from a KB by generating a fitting and optimal decision tree from it. Whereas the consideration of the fitting factor for a decision tree depends exclusively on the KB from which it is induced, the optimality factor depends on the nature of the problem in hand. Thus, the resulting tree strictly respects all the properties and priorities of the KB's rules as well as the optimality criterion.",

    "abstract": "Application execution required in cloud and fog architectures are generally heterogeneous in terms of device and application contexts. Scaling these requirements on these architectures is an optimization problem with multiple restrictions. Despite countless efforts, task scheduling in these architectures continue to present some enticing challenges that lead us to question how tasks are routed between different physical devices, fog nodes and cloud. In fog, due to its density and heterogeneity of devices, the scheduling is very complex and, in the literature, there are still few studies that have been conducted. However, scheduling in the cloud has been widely studied. Nonetheless, many surveys address this issue from the perspective of service providers or optimize application quality of service (QoS) levels. Also, they ignore contextual information at the level of the device and end users and their user experiences. In this paper, we conducted a review of the literature on the main task scheduling algorithms in cloud and fog architecture; we studied and discussed their limitations, and we also explored and suggested some perspectives for improvement.",

The research takes place in a Secondary School in the central coastal region of Portugal. In order to answer the research problem - “How to develop citizen science strategies using the Internet of Things, within the scope of a SSL, aiming to enhance the participatory citizenship of students?” - design-based research (DBR) strategies will be applied, in an iterative evolutionary approach, interchanging between action and critical thinking, with integrative activities that will fuel the project.Artefacts and guidelines will be co-constructed between researchers, teachers, students and local community - didactic kits with transdisciplinary contents, promoters of citizen science skills and supported by digital electronics and IoT - that should endure beyond the study and be subsequently adopted, adapted and used by other teachers from the institution where this study takes place. Regarding the results expected with this study, the highlights are: the production of the didactic kits “education” and “citizen” which will contribute, per se, to the common good, with the detection of environmental problems in the target city of study; the improvement of the students' citizen science skills; and the realization of the potential of the IoT by the teachers who take part in the study, mainly in what concerns the development of pedagogical - didactic and social-communicative skills.",

    "abstract": "There are many challenges in teaching and learning algorithms and programming, including the lack of motivation to learn and the lack of teaching models that make it easier to guide students adequately during their learning process. For its part, gamification in education offers the potential to make learning more motivating and enjoyable for those who learn. However, the design and implementation of teaching and learning models remains a largely unsatisfied challenge. Most of the authors present in their proposals the design of gamified virtual learning environments and very little in relation to the gamification of face-to-face activities within the classroom. This paper presents a model with the following features: 1) Independent work development, where activities are resolved within class with the teacher accompaniment; 2) bonuses-based evaluation in class for the assertive solution of challenges which are added to their test results; 3) Development of videogame projects that involve the interests and passions of the students, in which the concepts learned are applied. The implementation of this model during the development of two parallel courses of algorithms and programming for the first semester in 2019-1 and 2019-2 has shown positive results regarding the interaction of students in the classroom, autonomous learning, commitment to the assigned works, better understanding of the course contents and greater motivation to learn.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the performance analysis of a new TCP algorithm designed for wireless networks on a realtime scenario compared to the generic TCP algorithm. Our work considers two network scenarios: indoor and outdoor with point-multipoint topology. The performance evaluation considers the throughput, jitter and delay metrics, to obtain these metrics the intrusive traffic injection technique was used using the D-ITG software, while for the qualitative analysis the Mean Opinion Score technique was used through a survey to establish a subjective measure of the quality perceived by the user based on the different network conditions. The results indicate that the new TCP algorithm presents a significant improvement of reduction by approximately 6% compared to jitter and delay metrics.",

In this context, this work aims to propose a mapping between MR-MPS-SW and C2M models. The proposed mapping was reviewed and evaluated by five experts with experience in software process improvement. This mapping allowed us to identify that 82.2 % of C2M practices has some type of coverage for the expected MR-MPS-SW results. Finally, it is possible to see that the models here mapped are not conflicting, but rather complementary, with C2M being partially adherent to MR-MPSsw.",

Citizens who are at the scene of an attack are the only ones who can react immediately. A prompt and effective response is often a key aspect that determines the number of victims. The security potential of citizens is an important part of the response and resilience of the soft target. Many citizens are aware of and accept this responsibility. They educate voluntarily for the case of a violent attack. However, they acquire this knowledge unsystematically. Our educational platform takes advantage of the multimedia form of education. It contains first-person video sequences in which the user is exposed to a violent security incident. The incident is divided into many points where the user decides what to do next. Based on these decisions, the student will see the consequences of their decisions and recommendations for improvement. User abilities and equipment are defined according to the input questionnaire. The video simulator shows the user the options he would have if he were to live in this situation.",

The literature relevant to it, needs much clarification regarding this. The purpose of this paper is to find out if there is any relationship between intellectual capital and business performance. Together with knowing what kind of studies exist, it constitutes the research question. The paper's contribution is reflected in the exhibition, a summary of the studies that would otherwise appear isolated. As more outstanding results, it is worth mentioning the fact that business performance is conditioned by the context of the empirical studies carried out and the concept of profiled intellectual capital. We conclude that studies with more generic definitions of intellectual capital, with more objective ways of measuring it and, therefore, obtaining its value, would appear more in line with the knowledge of the relationship between intellectual capital and business performance.",

The methodology used is based on the collection of traffic from each platform for comparison purposes. For this, an architecture was developed, and appropriate metrics were established. Considering Youtube as case study, the results show that the web platform uses less data for the average case, but that the recommendation based on the user profile, whether active or passive, will result in a consistently lower data usage.",

To control the use of eduroam network in the Departamento de Informática of the Universi-dade do Minho, and to allow planning future updates of the infrastructure, traffic was collected and processed from 33 Access Points (APs) in order to provide real-time results for analysis. In this context, a web application with a friendly interface and topological data was developed, which allows monitoring in realtime the entire wireless environment in the department, while identifying and locating incorrect behavior and/or performance degradation. In the development, PHP and Javascript were used for data processing and user interaction, while RRTool was used for storing data. The obtained results allow to conclude that the existing APs are not currently overloaded. However, the rapid increase in the number of connected devices may compromise the quality of using the eduroam network. Therefore, the developed monitoring application is crucial to assist the current usage and plan the future evolution of eduroam infrastructure.",

As river waters are a fundamental resource for the population (consumption and leisure), this paper aims to explore a system for analyzing and monitoring river water quality in real-time. To this end, the use of an adaptive Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is explored, taking river beaches along the Cávado River in Portugal as a case study.The approach adopted to implement this network involves having, in zones identified as being at risk, sensors that will measure a variety of physical-chemical, microbiological parameters and other substances considered by the Ministry of Environment as indicators of pollution. In addition, on the surrounding river beaches, Sinks (or Base Stations) will send requests to the sensors for obtaining their readings. The adaptive capacity of the adopted control algorithms allows that whenever an anomaly in the read values is detected, the frequency of the sensor readings increases in order to monitor more closely the location where the anomaly was detected. The platform used for the implementation, reconfiguration and monitoring of the communication algorithms adopted was CupCarbon, which integrates the OSM (OpenStreetMaps) API and Google Maps, which allows the development of a prototype based on real locations.",

The hypothesis explored is that, with support given by software to collaborative learning, each element included into a diagram is based on both support and refutation reasons, corroborated by evidence, which constitute arguments not only to explain the diagram as a product but to improve students' and teachers' competencies in deliberation process.",

Although one may find in literature techniques to automate the impact identification process, it is still highly dependent on the experience with the analyzed software. Studies in this area do not focus on the analysis of the possible impact identified by the techniques. In this paper, we propose a visual approach to deal with the results generated by applying an impact analysis technique to oriented source code. Coordinating visual mappings makes it possible to identify impacted entities regarding the individual difficulty of maintenance. Also, it is possible to determine how are affected the entities. In this paper, we present the implemented approach (tool VisImpala), the generated views, how to interpret them, and the lessons learned.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, many studies on the use of active learning methodologies have been presented to the academic community, both for face-to-face and distance learning (distance education). In this sense, this article presents partial results of a systematic review of the literature on the adoption of the active methodology of Problem-based Learning (PBL) in Distance Education. The systematic review defined a research protocol that included the planning, execution, and analysis of the results. Planning phase defined research objectives and questions, search string, choice of search engines, and elaboration of exclusion criteria. In the execution phase, 633 scientific articles were selected from the research using the string in the search engines, followed by the application of the exclusion criteria, to which 90 studies were included, which were analyzed in full to answer the research questions. This paper presents the analysis of the first research question: How can the three main phases of the active PBL methodology (planning, execution, and evaluation) be applied in distance education?",

Based on discoveries found in the state of the art, and a non-probability sampling survey (it included specific questions about geospatial analytics learning and geographic information systems learning), teaching-learning framework for a course is proposed, it is structured in 5 modules, that cover from the description of information products until the display of dashboards to visualize the behavior of data as a mechanism for decision-making. Each module is formed of one or more case studies, a foundation guide, and a practice or praxis component that includes the use of technological tools.",

This study reports on the use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) by HR professionals to assist applicant selection. It employs a survey methodology based on a cross-sectional questionnaire which was administered to a sample of 10000 professionals in Portugal. The response rate was 10.5% and the results show that 41% of the respondents use SNS in employee selection. The most used SNS are LinkedIn (89%) and Facebook (58%), and the evaluation of applicant profiles usually takes place before the first interview. Around three quarters of participants indicate to assess applicants by forming a general impression of their adjustment to the organization. The most regularly inferred constructs from profiles are work experience, education and training, written communication skills, maturity and professionalism. Respondents infer more often the outcome person-organization adjustment. The conclusion is that for many Portuguese organizations SNS seem to be a useful complementary tool to the most conventional personnel selection techniques.",

However, in some developing countries this has not yet happened, due to circumstances in the region and due to political, economic or social considerations that in some way have impeded their development or have developed in an incipient manner with the collaboration of concerned international organizations. Models and examples of National Strategies have been published, but in some cases oriented to developed countries or cultures different from that of the region. Good practice manuals have also been prepared by international organizations that work on these issues, based on lessons learned in similar exercises carried out in some cases with foreign consultants far from the local reality. This work presents a proposal based on good practices and knowledge of the local reality previously defined through research carried out on the components of a National Strategy. The proposal aims to guide those interested in the product to obtain after a participatory methodological process of executing a life cycle explained in previous works published by these authors.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are dedicated networks used in applications where environmental information must be collected, such as temperature, humidity, level, flow, pressure, rain, radiation, among others. These kinds of networks are constrained regarding power, bandwidth, number of nodes per area unit, etc. It is desirable that they operate without supervision and can work steadily in time, because they are normally located in difficult or far places. Nonetheless, some of these metrics are conflicting with others, so if one improves, some of the others get worse. So, it is mandatory to know what is the best combination of metrics that in conjunction can fit an application the best. Literature reports works where optimization is used as a mathematical scheme to solve this problem, and two scenarios are provided: first, where a single objective function is proposed regarding one metric, and the other metrics are restricted via constraints, and second, where multi-objective optimization (MOOP) approaches are proposed, but without considering the whole set of significant metrics involved in WSN, so there is not a definitive solution that finds a real optimal set of metrics. System Dynamics (SD) is a computer-aided approach to design and analyze (mostly) social, economic and enterprise systems, that allows proposing a mathematical framework to analyze such complex systems, by using relationships of interdependence, mutual interaction, feedback and causality. This work aims to show a first dynamic hypothesis of a model that considers important metrics of WSN, in order to find a set of equations that serve as objective functions in a MOOP context. By applying this methodology is possible to find some difficult relations between metrics, that are not clearly reported by previous work so far.",

The methodology for the development of fuzzy models based on clustering and pivot tables was used for the development of the fuzzy inference model. The data were obtained from the Legis Comex database on financial information for the year 2017 for the services sector of Colombia. In total, there were 5,372 companies. The type of problem for this case study is classification. Results show 90% of accuracy, with an average absolute deviation of 0.096 (less than 10%) with a Kappa index of 84.7%, indicating excellent performance in the task of classifying a company's bankruptcy risk. As a main conclusion we can establish that the implemented methodology could be considered a learning technique because it uses multiple layers of processing that help represent the behavior of data with multiple levels of abstraction, helping to convert linear problems into nonlinear due to the uniqueness of fuzzy logic.",

The new student generations pose challenges to the academic models of how to acquire and share knowledge, interact with colleagues and especially how to be evaluated. An crucial challenge for programming courses is to propose projects that create opportunities for students to develop both technical and soft skills necessary in their future professional careers. The objective of this work is to share the experience of teaching and learning through a project based on STEM education in an Artificial Intelligence course in a technical university program. An approach based on active learning was used to develop the programming project. In giving teams of students a problem to solve, the project promoted the principles of active learning. Once aware of the challenge ahead and what skills they would need, students were offered workshops to prepare them with the skills necessary to accomplish the final task. Students were given the main materials required to complete the project, namely a small programmable robot powered by a smartphone. The evaluation was based on rubrics and oriented towards a functional product. Each team developed a robot prototype that could to participate in match of RoboSoccer and made a technical report about the project. The first results showed that the students were working in an integral way, professional competences related to teamwork, research, creativity, communication and leadership, mainly. Also, the teams were able to develop a robot prototype that could play a RoboSoccer match.",

    "abstract": "MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) courses have revolutionate the relationship between society and higher education institutions. Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. The promising future of MOOC courses and their great popularity was due, in large part, to their initial philosophy, in which a new global service would convert the uninitiated into higher education into online students worldwide and with Offers from the best universities, especially in places with limited access. Over the years they have evolved and changed their orientation. And in a way it loses its initial interest as a resource in an area with few educational resources. However, this new methodology \"at a distance\", fits very well with the current demands of students, who want greater autonomy and ability to manage their time. And it is with this orientation that MOOC courses may currently have greater potential. Thus, there are few universities that in one way or another (training itineraries, inverted classroom, etc.) are trying to integrate MOOCs into regulated teaching. It is necessary, therefore, an exhaustive educational investigation of the proposal and its performance to be able to make decisions in the medium term. Thus, we describe a case study, in which a MOOC course has been designed and deployed in the electronic engineering area, in accordance with the contents of a first level university course. We wanted to find out, in a special way, the interest and preference of MOOC courses of students who begin engineering studies compared to other learning methods used, in an usual way, in both traditional and other current university studies, “online” or with multimedia resources. For it, a t-test has been carried out at the end of the course. The results obtained surprisingly value the MOOC course over the other learning resources presented. On the other hand, we have analyzed the performance of the students and their academic results, as well as the level of achievement of the planned objectives and the overall satisfaction of the participants.",

New physical infrastructures are resource constrained, lack of power supply or fixed communication links and tend to be pervasive. In this context, traditional strategies for service deployment, based on dashboards from where new services are distributed among all components making up the communication networks, are not feasible. New communication networks deployed in smart agriculture, pervasive sensing, smart environments and other similar scenarios are, in fact, based on ad hoc networks which are only related to the global networks and the Internet through data mules. These data mules may be any existing vehicle, but drones are probably the most interesting case, although it is also the most complicated one (as the introduce an additional spatial variable: the height). In these new networks, services are typically embedded into physical components and they are specifically programmed to only perform certain activities, so no new services could be considered without removing the existing hardware nodes. Therefore, in this paper it is proposed a new service deployment mechanism to be integrated into ad hoc networks with constrained resources. Services will be deployed through software agents and a new specific protocol. Besides, this protocol allows to deploy services with different categories, so ad hoc networks could support services with different Quality-of Service. The proposed solution enables the service deployment from drones. Finally, in order to evaluate the proposed mechanism, it is performed an experimental validation based on simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Perfumes are part of our daily life. They can be a possible way to express our beauty or they can bring to life some memories or they can be simply hygienical accessories. Hard to describe, impossible to see. Perfumes have some mystical aura above them. For the industry perspective, perfumes present a challenge that is how to turn visible such an invisible, intangible and mystical object. The lineup questions of this study seek to explore the artistic endeavor perfumes can display and the advantages of retrieving data to improve the exhibition and to develop new business models. To develop this theoretical, conceptual and exploratory study one must look at some of the scholars' contributions to this subject and the fragrance exhibitions made to this day. Moreover, some empirical knowledge that helps to understand how value is perceived into modern perfumery is stated; such knowledge comes from previous exhibitions, either fragrance-related exhibitions or immersive experience exhibitions, and it can be studied and improved from one's empirical experience. The study is aimed to serve as support for a Perfume Art Exhibitions and it will develop a role model for future olfactory art exhibitions. Sensorial experiences and the visitors' embodiment are critical factors for the success of an exhibition; hence this article seeks to propose a new exhibition model, totally oriented for the visitors' needs and expectations but also for the brands' market research and segmentation efforts. The 3-block model can be used for both an exhibition and to a permanent art museum. This model is innovative because it enhances the artistic role of perfumes and it will get visitors to dive into perfumes, gaining vocabulary and exploring the making of' perfumes.",

From 2020 onwards, the invoices and other fiscally relevant documents must contain a two-dimensional bar code (QR-Code) which will encompass all the information related to the invoice, thus allowing the consumer to send this information digitised to his e-invoice, without the introduction of the NIF. The aim of this article is to evaluate the contribution that this modification will originate on the different stakeholders present in the system, in order to guarantee the authenticity of the origin, the integrity of the content, and legibility of the invoices. It is also intended, to analyze the advantages of the QR-Code in invoices, and describe the different stakeholders in the system. The methodology used in the execution of this article was Design Science Research (DSR). The research method was based on the analysis of diverse bibliographic sources that deal with the most relevant aspects of the invoice evolution process, namely legal diplomas as well as the analysis of international standards, frameworks and technological specifications. The paper's contributions have as underlining the presentation of an Approach that enables process stakeholders to understand the differences, requirements and development strategies to be followed for the implementation of the QR-Code in the fiscal context.",

In this paper, a novel decision support system that relies on this kind of radars is presented. The aim of this system is to propose a time-frequency algorithm based on micro-Doppler signatures to detect and identify complex moving targets on public roads. Before obtaining this signature, each radar signal is improved using pre-processing techniques. Then, the short-time Fourier transform is applied to analyse and represent each signal received from the radar. Finally, different scenarios including pedestrians, vehicles and cyclists were used to demonstrate the performance of our system in target detection. The results have validated that pedestrians can be correctly identified only relying on their micro-Doppler signatures. As an example, this paper presents several use cases in which pedestrian signatures are characterized by vertical lines unlike vehicles and cyclists where signatures have horizontal lines characterized by larger vertical strips.",

In the same vein, digital applications (app's) are more and more and increasingly replace services previously provided through a physical presence. E-banking is the perfect example of this phenomenon. Though this study, it was sought to know the opinion of elderly people over 65 years of age regarding applications directed to e-banking, realising their limitations. Thus, the methodology used was based on the structured interview technique (in order to understand the sociodemographic data), participant observation of the interaction with the app (with registration in the observation grid), field notes and focus group. This was applied to 5 elderly people who know how to read and write, in a day center in a location without ATM (ATM). It was concluded that although they consider the applications interesting, they prefer face-to-face service.",

The digital age has advanced, on a large scale, the knowledge society. Information is processed quickly for millions of people and it comes multifaceted by images, sounds and digital artefacts which provide interaction between the reader and the text. This reality has reached the classroom, which is stagnant in the face of new times. Here is a great discussion: how to teach and learn in the digital age? Therefore, this article aims to implement a teacher training model using the m-learning modality, anchored in digital skills for the use of dynamic technological resources in the classroom. This research will consist of a case study with a qualitative approach, validated by questionnaires that can be answered, via mobile devices. In this perspective, it is expected that teachers interact, through mobile learning, with some training content which will assist them in the use of ICT in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent environments work collaboratively, bringing more comfort to human beings. The intelligence of these environments comes from technological advances in sensors and communication. IoT is the model developed that allows a wide and intelligent communication between devices. Hardware reduction of IoT devices results in vulnerabilities. Thus, there are numerous concerns regarding the security of user information, since mobile devices are easily trackable over the Internet. Care must be taken regarding the information in user profiles. Mobile devices are protected by a permission-based mechanism, which limits third-party applications from accessing sensitive device resources. In this context, this work aims to present a proposal for materialization of application for the evolution of user profiles in intelligent environments. Having as parameters the parameters presented in the proposed taxonomy. The proposed solution is the development of two applications, one for Android devices, responsible for allowing or blocking some features of the device. And another in Cloud, responsible for imposing the parameters and privacy criteria, formalizing the profile control module (PRIPRO - PRIvacy PROfiles).",

Different attempts have been made for reducing the impacts ranging from traffic management actions to shared-vehicle concepts to simply reducing the number of vehicles on the streets. By relying on cooperative approaches between different logistics companies, such as sharing and pooling resources for bundling deliveries in the same zone, an increased environmental benefit can be attained. To quantify this benefit we compare the CO2 emissions, fuel consumption and total delivery time resulting from deliveries performed by one cargo truck with two trailers versus by two single-trailer cargo trucks under real conditions in a simulation scenario in the city of Linz in Austria. Results showed a fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction of28% and 34% respectively in the scenario in which resources were bundled in one single truck.",

The term is used to describe the basis of essential user requirements that must be considered when making design decisions for product development. However, there is a wide range of such requirements. It seems almost impossible to get a manageable overview of the possible characteristics of the context of use, especially when several people are involved in product development. For collaboratively developing contexts of use, morphological analysis offers a potential method for structuring creativity. The morphological analysis is a procedure for deriving the necessary parameters and their characteristics in a structured way. It is useful for developing an overview of a possible context of use and can help create a shared understanding of the context of use. Two teams were observed and subsequently interviewed via questionnaire to learn how morphological analysis supports the collaborative understanding of a context of use and to identify good and bad practices when using morphological analysis in this way. The results show that morphological analysis helps to develop a shared understanding of context of use by supporting a structured exchange in a team. Furthermore, seven good and six bad practices in conducting such an analysis were identified.",

One of these areas is the design and creation of statistical charts, focused so far on blind people or people with severely limited visual faculties. Based on a review of the literature and a previous work developing of a set of heuristics, this work includes a set of guidelines for the creation of accessible statistical charts for people with low vision.",

Through a questionnaire with a convenience sample type, applied to 102 people over 65 years old in the Lisbon region, it was possible to understand the difficulties that the senior population feels when using ICT and to understand the relationship of the elderly with ICT. Age, low qualification and lack of perception of benefits are presented as the main factors that limit the use of technology. It has become important to analyze the policies and initiatives that have been developed to try to combat the digital exclusion in the senior population, and which of the initiatives developed had the greatest impact in reducing the difficulties experienced by them, such as training sessions and support from teachers and family.",

The objective of this work was to highlight critical points of DM quality and its implications for studies in agriculture and livestock. The literature reports problems of accuracy, completeness and consistency in the quality of some datasets, being also apparent issues related to the dimensions of temporality and trustiness of these data. Considering the origin of these problems, issues were observed both from the DM collection systems and from the sensors used. In conclusion, DM quality studies applied in the agricultural and zootechnical context, although current, are still few, being considered an issue for data management in these fields.",

Due to the increased demand for online services and solutions, cloud computing has grown exponentially in recent years, as has the storage of your information, its services delivered and offered online. These factors have collaborated so that, increasingly, the services offered are fault-tolerant, whether they are related to software or hardware. For that, it is necessary that the cloud environments, be prepared with techniques for the detection and treatment of failures if they occur. In this way, this work studied the possible flaws in the cloud computing architecture and their respective techniques for detection and treatment in cloud environment simulators. This study was based on the main failures and fault tolerance techniques existing in relevant cloud managers today. Thus concluding that, in order to be successful in fault-tolerant systems, it is necessary to create libraries that allow their detection and their respective treatment.",

A quantitative study is presented, which applies the questionnaire based on the Internet Catalunya project to 16,287 high school students in Ecuador. It is proposed as a hypothesis that the use of Internet resources and tools affect the level of plagiarism of high school students. The Chi-square statistic is applied, to determine the existence of correlations of different variables with the level of plagiarism, and k-means to establish categories of students based on the number of hours they devote to different activities on the Internet, obtaining three groups that we have called: a) liabilities, b) chat and video, c) games and videos. As a result, it is obtained that sex and income level directly affect the level of plagiarism; Regarding the number of hours devoted to chat, a dichotomy is shown, since those who spend more time chatting on academic subjects have a lower tendency to plagiarize. In general, the resources and tools available on the Internet in their various forms if they affect the level of plagiarism.",

The aim of this document is to develop a voice-controlled assistance system that helps older adults to remember important events in daily life such as taking a medication or going to a doctor's appointment. In this way, the system allows older adults to store important events that are mentioned during the day in any natural conversation, either by them or by the person who cares for them, in a Google calendar, so that later all the activities that the older person should do can be recorded. A study was carried out on 5 older adults together with their children or caregivers, in order to check how difficult, it is for this population to remember events and activities that are indicated to them in a natural way. The caregivers were asked to indicate 3 activities to be performed in the following week between Monday and Sunday and 3 medical indications with a period of time and hours in which the medicine should be ingested, and then asked if they could remember each activity after 30 minutes of listening to it. The results of the evaluation indicate that older adults tend to forget and the assistance system will make daily life easier.",

This paper focuses on Brazilian patients and their acceptance of telemedicine through the Theory of Planned Behavior and the concept of Plasticity as a superordinate factor of the patients' personality traits. An online survey of Brazilian patients was carried out, and PLS analysis was then utilized on the results. Results indicate that the proposed model explains 62.1% of the behavioral intention of the use of telemedicine by the patients. Furthermore, the findings indicate that attitude has the strongest direct effect on behavioral intention, with plasticity playing a considerable role in the strength of the effect.",

In addition, they are considered public health problems. In recent years, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming a promising method as an alternative to monitor and control overweight and obesity, in addition to reducing economic costs and reducing the time between visits to doctors and nutritionists. This article presents a proposal for a mobile application to keep track of and monitor the problems of overweight and obesity. It seeks timely information for both the patient and the nutritionist and doctor and establish that communication between the parties. The mobile application connects the nutritionist and the patient, in which the patient supplies data to the application that is stored in a database. The prototype provides timely information for both the patient and the nutritionist and doctor, establishing communication channels between the parties to obtain regular updates on the progress of patients, personalized and precise suggestions from nutritionists, for sustained behavior change, helping to combat the phenomenon of obesity. The proposed application is based on the approach of new mobile technologies, which allows the rapid development of apps.",

In turn, such agile transformation offers great promise in the implementation of e-government projects in public administration. It was found that such agile paradigm can reduce the risk of failure in e-government projects through a high degree of communication and through an affinity to change regarding the requirements. In this article we have outlined the current state of our research regarding the measurement of the progress of agile transformation in public administration through the use of a screening instrument. This is done by building upon previous research in the area which describes the applicability of the screening instrument in the field of public administration. The scope of application of this screening instrument will then be broadened by defining a prototypical recommendation for usage, enabling continuous and targeted improvement in the course of agile transformation. This recommendation describes an iterative process comprised of seven steps. Defining concrete practices and methods for each of these steps will enable the development of this process which can then support a targeted agile transformation in public administration.",

The learning ecosystem metamodel defined in previous works solves several problems related to the definition and implementation of these solutions. However, there are still challenges associated with improving the analysis and visualization of information as a way to discover knowledge and support decision making processes.

Additionally, the access of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - which are predominant in the country - to international markets currently not significant. Previous studies suggest that there is a direct relationship between the degree of innovation and the degree of internationalization of organizations. In this scenario, this article aims to analyze this relationship based on a field study carried out in 224 small and medium-sized manufacturing companies located in the Atlantic region, in Colombia. The results show that the structuring and participation in research and development programs, access to information technology and the existence of standardized processes and products in the organization are elements that potentially increase competitiveness and contributes to access international markets. Therefore, the adoption of SME export promotion policies that focus on stimulating innovation can contribute to the growth of exports of non-traditional products by organizations of this size.",

These transformations invite us to reflect on the skills and abilities that these communicators must acquire in order to be able to function with solvency in the work scenario. In this sense, communication faculties play a decisive role in achieving this task. Based on this, a comparative study is presented between four universities (Spain: Complutense of Madrid and Autónoma of Barcelona; and Colombia: Sabana and Rosario, Ecuador: San Francisco University and Eqinoccia University) to find out what presence data journalism has in their respective curricula. In this way, the work analyzes the objectives, the type of subjects, the syllabus and the evaluation system, among other aspects, of the set of subjects of the curricular offer with the objective of identifying which themes and from which approach they work in each center.",

Over time, tourism planning approaches have been implemented within the framework of demand growth, supply specialization, change in traveler behavior patterns, economic growth of the tourism destination, and community participation in the productive model, that is, always based on market elements, but none of them identifying the elements of identity and social value, not from marketing but the social fabric, especially in indigenous and black ethnic communities. A documentary review of tourism planning models, indicators of quality of life and wellbeing and the elements of prior consultation and citizen participation for ethnic peoples will be carried out. It is expected that the proposed model will strengthen tourism planning, fulfilling its objective of economic growth through the commercialization of the comparative advantages of the destinations, alerting in the first instance the possible low, medium and high impacts that the traditional villages may suffer, having the possibility of mitigating these impacts through efficient governmental and/or corporate decision making in the territories, towards the community, allowing to establish the degree of importance of the differentiating elements by community, in terms of cosmogonic understanding versus tourism development.",

However, financial auditors are faced with what is now called the Big Data phenomenon. The objective of this article is to determine the impact that Big Data is having on financial auditing in Portugal and how auditors perceive this new scenario. For this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared and released among Portuguese professional auditors. According to the results obtained, most of the respondents are familiar with the Big Data concept but also consider that the information currently collected is sufficient to support auditing conclusions. These professionals assume that they feel limitations when faced with large amounts of data and that the current tools are not prepared for the analysis of large amounts of data, not to mention Big Data analysis. Regarding the efforts that can be made to increase knowledge of the Big Data in the auditing profession, the great majority are not aware of any professional or complementary training that mentioned the Big Data theme provided by the professional order. Our responses analysis leads to conclude that despite the impact that Big Data is having on society in general, a large number of audit professionals in Portugal are still not prepared to deal with this phenomenon.",

This change, triggered manly by the 2008 financial crisis, is expect a positive effect on audit quality or users' perception of it. The main objective of this paper is review the literature of this recent topic on the perspective of users and market reaction. The results of the influence of disclosure KAM in the audit report on users and market reaction are mixed. Some and experimental studies in Canada and in the US settings, on investors and financial analysts, find a positive influence of disclosure KAM on the audit quality perception, which is not find in German setting on bank directors. When it comes to archival papers, there is not found any investor reaction to disclosure KAM.",

Due to the complexity of software testing, most of the work of AI/ML applied to it is still academic. This paper briefly presents the state of the art in the field of software testing, applying ML approaches and AI algorithms. The progress analysis of the AI and ML methods used for this purpose during the last three years is based on the Scopus Elsevier, web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Algorithms used in software testing have been grouped by test types. The paper also tries to create relations between the main AI approaches and which type of tests they are applied to, in particular white-box, grey-box and black-box software testing types. We conclude that black-box testing is, by far, the preferred method of software testing, when AI is applied, and all three methods of ML (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement) are commonly used in black-box testing being the “clustering” technique, Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms applied to “fuzzing” and regression testing.",

It analyzes 6626 interactions occurred during a month on their official Twitter profiles in order to analyze engagement strategies used by the most influential journalists. Each tweet was coded attending any of the four categories: content curation, positioning, personalization and specialization. The coding was conducted by a researcher and then it was verified by random checks from three more coders. The most commonly used strategy by journalists was content curation; news specifically written and published in the timeline of the journalist or taken from their media company, followed by content recommendation from non-media actors, and lastly content recommendation from journalists of a different media company. The second most frequent personalization strategy was retweeting, while the most absent was personal content or direct dialogue with the audience by mentioning or directly tweeting them. Thirdly, the positioning strategy appears to be focused mainly on taking sides or supporting individuals and groups in certain causes. The taking sides strategy generated more comments from the audience. Finally, there are few actions that can be considered in the category of specialization, no evidence of publications related to investigative journalism and journalism data were found. Actions were registered to contextualize the information. A fifth emergent engagement strategy consisted in tweeting self-help phrases and motivational posts.",

This has forced public broadcasters to approach co-creation with the audience as a fundamental feature for the fulfillment of their innovation, participation and representation responsibilities. Co-creation, more intensely researched in the area of advertising, is, however, still uncommon in the realm of PSM academic work, s to its innovative and socializing potential. This paper compares 4 relevant co-creation cases in Ireland's RTÉ, Germany's ZDF and RTVE in Spain, with SBS Australia as a 4th case for contrast purposes. The aim of this study is to identify the values that emanate from these formats in the social responsibility framework of PSM, determine the social agents or cultural intermediaries that participate in co-creation and study the capacity of these formats to represent the more disfavored demographic sectors.",

Furthermore, if the organization's goal is also to improve organizational performance and increase competitiveness, then it is crucial to use ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, together with innovative accounting procedures and management strategies. This study aims to combine these two themes: ERP systems and maturity in Internal Audit. In order to assess the existence of a relationship between the adoption of these systems and the levels of maturity in internal auditing, a survey was conducted through a questionnaire to internal auditors in Portugal. It was concluded that, despite the majority of the answers to the questionnaire pointing to a high level of maturity of the internal audit, it was found that there is no statistical evidence that points to a direct relationship between the use of ERP Systems in the audit procedures and maturity levels in Internal Audit.",

Such transformation of business is a challenge today's organizations are faced with, and Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are no exception. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is the expression of the main strategies of an organization in terms of business, applications and technologies, and the impact they have on its processes and functions. However, despite the benefits of EA, and its possible role in DT, the way organizations can take advantage of EA in DT is yet poorly explored. This paper takes up a previous proposal of a methodology that promotes EA planning as a tool for DT and applies it in the digital transformation of a HEI. As such, we validate the previously proposed approach, and the two phases of development, which will contribute to placing EA as a tool for solving the problems of HEI digital transformation initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Advertising investment in Spanish regional televisions, publicly owned media, was already below one hundred million euros in 2019. This broke a psychological threshold that, in turn, evidences the bankruptcy of a financing model that leads these media to almost total dependence on the general budgets of their respective autonomous communities. Over the past twenty years, this type of investment has experienced a drop of 76.6 percent, with an accelerated negative trend since 2015. In order to determine the scenario in which the advertising revenue of this television channel model is located and to identify its trend and impact on the management model, the last twenty years (2005-2019) have been analyzed, using the data collected in Infoadex's respective annual reports; for this purpose, a time series has been constructed that, due to its number of data, shows an acceptable robustness and consequently allows to achieve solvent results, albeit of an exploratory and approximate nature, aimed at serving as a reference for a subsequent study with methodology based on descriptive statistics. As a more significant conclusion, it should be noted that advertising investment in regional television shows a significant greater retraction than that of national television broadcasters and the revenues obtained from this business activity are destined to play an irrelevant role in their operating accounts, which leads to an urgent reformulation of their current management model.",

This study aims to compare the use of computerized tools that are used by the Portuguese Statutory Auditors (ROC) and by the Internal Auditors. In addition, the study also compares the audit procedures that are supported by these tools for both types of auditors and identifies which factors (age, sex, qualifications and professional experience) influence their use. In order to respond to these objectives, the data collected from the ROC and the internal auditors were analyzed through a questionnaire survey. We can observe a strong similarity of results regarding the use of these tools by the two types of respondents. We also concluded that the number of years of experience as an internal auditor is the only variable in the study that may influence the use of these tools.",

    "abstract": "To ensure that a research project is relevant and recognized as sound research by academics, organizations and the society in general, it must be demonstrated that the research has been rigorously planned and developed and is open to debate and verification. In this context, and to give credibility to the investigation, it is necessary to use an appropriate research method. And, there are several research methods to choose from. Within the research methodologies used in the scientific areas of Information Systems / Information Technology (IS/IT) and Digital Transformation (DT), the Design Science Research (DSR) method has emerged. This method focuses on the development of artifacts that extend the current boundaries of IT to improve business and organizational performance. After a brief approach to the subject area under research, in this article we study the DSR method. In the end we talk about the strategy to be used in the research under this method. The main aim of this paper is to argue that DSR is a research method suitable to research projects in the area of digital transformation.",

The empirical study was based on unlisted companies in Portugal, with a total of 50.505 corporations and between 2008 and 2016. To conclude, corporate governance is a process system that follows the financial, economic and organizational nature and it characterizes how companies are managed and controlled. For this reason, the results of this study allow us to conclude that the policies and values of corporate governance have an impact on the financial performance and financial reporting of companies.",

The absence of a standard for formatting the data record and the respective volume, make it difficult to extract the corresponding information. The lack of work, specifically in the treatment of SOA server log files, did not allow the comparisson with pre-existing Key Performance Indicators (KPI) or a set of best practices that could be followed. This work results in a description of the process that can serve as a guide for: definition of a logging structure; construction of a data extraction process; definition of a data structure to support the extracted information; definition of control metrics; definition of analysis and control processes for the extracted data.. Given the size of the files and the diversity of types of information that existed, it was necessary to use Python programming for data extraction and pre-treatment, Excel for data pre-treatment, Tableau for statistical treatment and presentation of results.",

    "abstract": "Financial auditing focuses on obtaining and assessing evidence, based on certain assertions. It is based on the scrutiny of companies' data, with the objective of obtaining appropriate and sufficient evidence that provides a reasonable degree of certainty that the financial statements are free from fraud and / or material errors, subsequently communicating the results to the stakeholders. However, the growing dimension and complexity of organizations, well represented by the volume of data they currently generate and store, have greatly increased the requirements for the auditor's work, which must be effective and efficient. Classic audit procedures, which are highly dependent on sampling and manual procedures, have proved to be insufficient. Due to the massive amount of data, the emergence of new technologies and computer tools at a frenetic level, auditing is now being rethought, with the debate extending from professional organizations to academics. This article brings together the gaps and shortcomings recently revealed in the thought of the so-called traditional audit, and the challenges it faces today. It presents the new technologies, specifically Robotic Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence, as already having expression in today's audit, and which, in a future vision, are enhanced by their combination in Intelligent Process Automation.",

An internal audit could benefit from the introduction of AI in its tasks, namely though the automation of audit processes that make it faster and more efficient allowing an increase in the degree of complexity of the tasks that internal auditors may perform. This will enhance the skills of internal auditors in fields like the determination of business processes and associated risks and controls in anticipated detection of fraud and the following up of anomalies in real-time. This article features a set of technologies of AI and the set of benefits it adds to the internal audit. Two models of internal audit applied to artificial intelligence demonstrate how internal audit and internal auditors must adapt to the new reality of AI, by not losing their purpose and by bringing benefits to organizations.",

    "abstract": "Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) technologies have been widely used in physical ID cards in educational institutions due to its low-cost, simple integration and convenience. In a university campus, the RFID technology can be used for proximity-based authentication for services such as access control, student/employee attendance record, or in-campus payments. These RFID-based technologies present vulnerabilities that, if exploited, can compromise the university campus authentications systems. RFID skimming and tag killing are examples of attacks that are simple to execute and have a high impact on their victims. This paper exploits a tag-related vulnerability of an ID Card based on RFID technology for proximity-based authentication inside a university campus. The proof of concept presented shows that, by using low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software, it is simple to clone an ID card and perform RFID skimming, harming the real ID card users. Possible countermeasures are later introduced and discussed.",

This article presents a microservices oriented software architecture implementation for a middleware that allows the logically centralized collection and processing of traceability data to provide transparency to the consumers and provide data analysts with a source of data to gain new insights on the whole supply chain. Another goal of the middleware is to store and provide other descriptive information about the business, people and processes that comprise the supply chain to enable the creation of stories about the lifecycle of the food from the start of it life to just before it reaches the end consumer's shopping basket.",

The attack was one of the iconic news that marked the Chilean society, in general and the press in particular, regarding awareness about femicide and gender-based violence. This article analyzes the coverage and treatment that the digital newspapers La Cuarta and Las Ultimas Noticias gave to that case. The investigation applies a matrix of categories through the mixed content analysis technique to 706 editions of the newspapers, from the day the victim was beaten until the conviction of Mauricio Ortega, Rifos's former partner accused as the author of the facts. The analysis includes the universe of copies of both newspapers from May 14, 2016 to May 2, 2017.The study reveals that the aforementioned media proposed social representations that contributed to a secondary victimization of Nabila Rifo by unnecessarily exposing her and granting scabrous details of the case.",

This work is carried out in the city of Loja - Ecuador and focuses on carrying out an innovation management audit, as well as analyzing the use of social networks as they become strategic tools for proper administration. The main results obtained indicate that the hotels studied tend to a greater extent to the management of continuous innovation, where the dimensions of \"learning\" and \"relationships\" are those that require greater management in relation to the drive for innovation. Regarding social networks, the use of Facebook was analyzed using the Fanpage Karma tool and its main indicators. An inadequate management of this social network is determined because the commitment to its fans and followers is weak, in the best of cases only 1.0% of them have interacted with the publications made, a similar fact is reflected in the performance of the page. Consequently, the information, opinions or experiences of current and potential clients are being wasted, which will greatly limit the contracting of services, decision-making and competitiveness in the developing sector.",

In this sense, the objective of the article is to determine the effect that the human capital and the economic complexity (knowledge proxies) of a country have on the exports of ICT services. To achieve this, estimates with panel-corrected standard errors are used (with 100 countries, between 2005 and 2017); the procedure is carried out for groups of countries, according to income level. The results indicate the existence of a direct relationship between the explained variable and the knowledge proxies.",

The close relationship with viewers makes TV-Local remain even with the massive popularization of social networks. The purpose of the research is to determine if the open-air TV-Local stations of the Southern Region of Ecuador generate identity and proximity values and how the audiences perceive them. This region brings together public, private and community television and the implementation of Digital Terrestrial Television is in the initial stage, therefore, it is a valuable space to diagnose the appropriation of television in moments of transition. The methodology used is qualitative, includes the review of documentary sources, content analysis of legal documents and the application of discussion groups. The research concludes that local television stations act as elements of cohesion with society that recognizes itself with the medium and as articulators of identity.",

Considering the above, and to help the events monitoring and the communications in the grid, specifically the power failures, this research has as main objective to build a dashboard to monitor outages in a smart grid. For this purpose, a specialized company in the electrical sector was selected to apply and validate the dashboard. The CRISP-DM methodology was adopted, and it is focused on the business and require systematic interaction with business experts. Based on the literature about performance indicators in the electrical sector and dashboard's, and considering several interviews conducted with a specialist, metrics and performance indicators were defined. The graphics to include in the dashboard which are appropriate to the objectives and to the problem have also been defined. To evaluate the dashboard's usefulness and usability, a questionnaire was drawn up and then applied to a specialist in this area. It was possible to conclude that the tactical dashboard, with monthly and weekly views, is useful and easy to use. Thus, with this investigation, the companies win a dashboard to be incorporated into their commercial solutions and to be used by their customers. In addition, this dashboard presents a set of indicators to be monitored in the sector of energy distribution and demonstrates the suitability of the CRISP-DM methodology for the creation of dashboard's.",
