Due to the nature, usual employ and limited interaction possibilities with the device, an intensive use similarly to computer is hardly recommended. Instead, recurring to more casual and lightweight interfaces such as widgets, and obtaining information about the viewed contents has been considered a more appropriate employ of the potential of such a technology. This paper describes a recommendation system to be integrated with Digital TV Widget applications, which, by considering the user's program choices, is capable of presenting related commercial products and upcoming events, matching therefore the user's interests. The interface design is meant to be as simple and intuitive as possible, yet compatible with existing widget systems. This is achieved by recurring to similar button mapping and presenting color and geometric clues for its handling. This approach intends to offer simple, enjoyable, yet efficient personalized advertising features.",

Despite the existence of different tools for generating inventory of skills and his goals as Adaptive Skills Inventory - CALS, Inventory Planning and Programming Services Individual - ICAP and Adaptive Skills Curriculum - ALSC among others, these tools are still used empirically and little automated, making it impossible to see clearly the most important aspects that affect the evolution in the learning of a person with disabilities. That is why in this article presents the development of a model based on the principles of fuzzy and neural computing to assess adaptive skills in children with cognitive disabilities, so as to generate an effective feedback tool for process learning from the management of incomplete fuzzy or vague information that characterizes the inventory of skills and its associated objectives.",

This represents a major potential for uncovering, on a large scale, new knowledge about aggregate behaviors in the use of places. In this paper, we explore the concept of social web sensor, as a systematic data collection process that can be virtually attached to a particular location to retrieve location-based information from social network sites. This process is completely based on geographically scoped queries to SNS APIs and does not depend on real physical sensors. The objective of this study is mainly to assess the viability of this concept and uncover the potential and limitations of this approach as a reality mining tool for urban environments. We have created an initial implementation and conducted the respective evaluation through the deployment of a number of sensors in the city of London and the analysis of the respective results.",

To achieve this, the “ORganización de los PRocesos de ADquisición (ORPRAD)” procedure is implemented. ORPRAD procedure represents the existing dependencies among processes area using the digraphs and find the strongly connected components and cyclic groups. These groups using formal criteria have helped to determine the implementation sequences of the acquisition processes areas at maturity level 2.

Therefore, introducing software process improvement has been a path full of obstacles, leaving those who are involved in the improvement frustrated and more convinced than ever that they must continue doing their work as before.

Over a series of three empirical phases a method is developed to evaluate the advantages and limitations of Agile practices in knowledge creation and sharing for Agile teams. In the first phase, initial issues and characteristics concerning agile methodologies were collected with a scoping review of the period since the manifesto for Agile software development emerged. The second phase represents a hermeneutic analysis of the result set obtained in the first phase. Using a SWOT analysis, the third phase assesses Agile processes, their relationships with knowledge transfer management and their effects on the productivity of software development teams. This research offers some key insights for decision makers considering the adoption of Agile methodologies in software development activities.",

In some areas of Portugal, most of the society and its history are somehow interlaced with the history of the leather and all the associated processes of its production. There is a great lack of a “vivid” memory about the leather tanning process and its social implications. References to it in Guimarães city can be reduced to text and poor quality pictures. On the other hand, it is important to transmit to future generations the valuable role of the leather tanning in the local culture. At this point, the use of augmented reality techniques can help to illustrate interactively, expressively and with a compelling degree of immersion how this process used to be done, and help to preserve its memory. This project consisted in the development and implementation of an augmented reality application to young audiences that illustrates the ancient leather tanning process step-by-step. The resulting visualizations offer an impressive education experience that help to transfer a significant culture value of the Guimarães city.",

The specifics of the financial sector and its influence throughout the global economy make these challenges even more relevant. However, the business performance management systems implementation projects are complex, with a high degree of risk. In order to better understand the specifics of implementing these systems in companies in the financial sector in Portugal, a review of relevant literature, interviews and an online questionnaire were implemented. Through the analysis of the results, was compiled a list of problems and best practices that companies should consider when they wish to start a project to implement performance management systems. Good practices point to a crucial importance in the accuracy and quality of requirements elicitation, setting up an experienced and competent project team composed with distinct profiles of professionals, involving members from different areas of the organization so that they can actively contribute during the project development to its optimization. Focusing on quality and reliability of data, such as development of a useful and easy system to work with, are also relevant factors. This research supports companies that want to explore this area and may serve as a basis for building a set of case-studies and specializations of this issue based on the specifics of Portuguese business.",

There is considerably little time and constrained information and communication resources to search, identify and gather all the information in a manner that would facilitate the medical care process. The purpose of this paper is to identify and illustrate what kind of information is important, where to search and the time constraints that apply while gathering information according to a particular situation of medical care. Thus, it was selected the most frequent attending reason in a central Hospital. Storyboard and use case were created for the medical condition. The list of relevant clinical and diagnostic data was initially based on established guidelines, and then adjusted according to interviews with specialists aiming to refine and validate the process flow and determine the relevancy and collection time frames of the information along the process of medical attending. To illustrate the storyboard, a process chart was developed including the various stages of care provision that the patient undertakes. Integrated with health care events there is a representation of collection tasks and identification of types of data to be collected according to their priority. Another important element developed was the table describing what is considered important information and where it can be found. The patient clinical data can be largely spread along the different types of institutions (e.g. hospitals, primary clinics, labs). This paper illustrates the importance of accessing which data is considered relevant in different stages of care provision. It also shows by example where to search and what to search in a selected situation so to make a more efficient use of time and resources.",

Specifically the tool-machines makers have tried to solve these problems incrementing the capability of the machines they produce, essentially in speed and precision. The recent study of some problems associated to the machining process, has revealed the possibility of incrementing the productivity of some of vertical milling machine, only through the force control, keeping it constant and equal to the optimum value defined for the tool. The cutting force control, due to the system characteristics, can only be implemented by making use of adaptive control. In order to implement adaptive controllers we have at our disposal two technologies that have been showing good results. These technologies are Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. We thought that it would be of interest to research the use of Artificial Neural Networks in implementation of a controller. This has been the objective for the development of the work described in this paper. The results obtained have been encouraging, showing the possibility of implementing those controllers in real systems.",

The maintenance model allows the visual and interactive transmission of information related to the physical behavior of the elements. To this end, the basic knowledge of material most often used in walls, anomaly surveillance, techniques of rehabilitation, and inspection planning were studied. This information was included in a data base that supports the periodic inspection needed in a program of preventive maintenance. The results are obtained interactively and visualized in the virtual environment itself. A second prototype based on VR technology with application to construction planning, was implemented. This model intends to present the project in a three-dimensional (3D) way, connected to construction planning schedule, resulting in a valuable asset in monitoring the development of the construction activity, based on the construction planning designed. The 4D application considers the time factor showing the 3D geometry of the distinct steps of the construction activity, according to the plan establish to the construction. The VR technology is used, and presented as an innovative visual tool in supporting the fields of construction planning and of maintenance of buildings. It helps to establish a collaborative network between partners in a building.",

From vocational schools, through basic education to higher education, the use of teaching aids based on information technologies is now a common practice. Today, more than making large computing solutions to support the activities of e-learning, it is important to focus on software specific solutions whose cost of production / implementation has a quick return. In this context the need emerged to move forward with a system to support teaching and learning of foreign languages to facilitate communication between teachers and students. It is on this issue that we present a proposal to develop a computing solution that enables students to develop the skills of reading and speaking foreign languages within the classroom context or outside the classroom. In this specific case we address the English language. We also present a working prototype, which is available as freeware for the educational and the scientific community and can be used without restriction. Experimentally, tests were made with 20 volunteer students from ESTGL. They used the prototype, in order to validate the usability tests. Finally, we present some results that show the progression of learning in those students who used the system.",

Many existing distributed computing platforms are either complex or only allow for one type of job to be deployed. Conillon is lightweight and simple to use and yet allows any number of different jobs to be deployed and executed in parallel. Entirely new jobs can, in fact, be added dynamically. In this paper, we discuss the architecture and features of Conillon. We report on a series of experiments in which we test scalability, fault tolerance, and computation of different types of jobs on the same compute nodes.",

Involving the user in the development of the applications via the features that BPM brings can be a solution to this aspect, as the requirements would be specified by the domain experts and most of the difficulties of the requirements engineering process would be avoided. However, business process modeling notations seem to be a little bit complex for domain experts with reduced computer knowledge and their participation in the requirements engineering process turns complicated due to the difficulties derived from learning and using these notations. BPMN MUSIM tries to reduce the number of elements needed in a business process modeling notation to the minimum necessary and thus lowers the difficulties that domain experts experience when modeling their processes. The major problem regarding BPMN MUSIM is that there is no modeling software that enables it use, so we have decided to design and build a process modeling tool called Isastur Modeler that is used for business process modeling with BPMN MUSIM.",

Among all its attributes, what stands out is its adaptation to the problem based learning approach, where the emerging challenges promote active reasoning and critical thinking, also enhancing students' interest and motivation to address often complex subjects. These features make ER especially useful for teaching/learning Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In this work, a set of ER sessions is made available, which may be used to address problem solving themes related to multiplication and division operations, for elementary 4th grade students. These tools will enable teachers to address these subjects in an alternative manner as compared to conventional teaching. The resources provided in this paper can be framed within a wider context of an ER portal, where one may find other materials suitable for implementation in elementary schools.",

    "abstract": "Typically the institutions of higher education (IHE) have difficulty to obtain integrated information from their information systems, since most of them still work with isolated systems and without prospects for providing integrated services. In this context, the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and, in particular, Web Services are promising approaches for the integration of information systems by implementing reusable and interoperable services. The lack of integration between existing academic management and distance learning systems represents a problem for the institutions of higher education leading to the duplication of data and the lack of information coherence. This work contributes to the resolution of some of these problems by implementing a model of integration of the two systems used in most institutions of higher education: Moodle and Academic Management System. The model implemented through Web Services allows Moodle to get automatically information from academic management systems. In this way, we contribute to a significant reduction of Moodle administration tasks, increasing the quality of information that is provided to users, saving time, effort and reducing the number of errors inherent to manual tasks and the manipulation of information. This work also contributes in some way to an increase in the quality of education that is taught in institutions of higher education as it liberates teachers of some administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to their primary function. On the other hand, it also provides students with better information about their academic data.",

Our approach relies on a multi-agent system composed of proxy agents that act as mediators and providers of personalization meta-services, device adaptation and continuity of service for consumers of pre-existing location-based services. These proxy agents, which have Web services interfaces to ensure a high level of interoperability, perform service composition and take in consideration the preferences of the users, the limitations of the user devices, making the usage of different types of devices seamless for the end-user.

This phenomenon makes organization loses not only capabilities but also customer relationships, image, routines, and other more subtle issues, in some cases the ones that are most significant, as clients trust. When we face an organization where the business process are less depending from machinery and heavily rely on human relationships, this problem is even more relevant, being real estate business one such good example. Additionally, if we consider the increase time needed to sell propriety after recent subprime worldwide crisis, sometimes the broker who initiates the process is not the one who finalizes it. It's easy to retain in the organization information about activities we performed (what, when... which we main collectively consider as explicit knowledge). In other way, we can't say the same about the way those activities are performed (how, that can consider more of tacit knowledge). To solve this situation, organizations must promote ways to retain tacit knowledge, in a way that it can be stored and disseminated through the organization. This paper discusses such issues taking into consideration real estate professionals, forms of action against this phenomenon. Assess the contribution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), formulating a conceptual model for the capture and transfer knowledge, using Grounded Theory to inform the model.",

The prime challenges of the AAL are recognition of the assisted person's current activity and providing appropriate support to the person. But these systems need extensive studies on user modeling to be more efficient to adapt the changes of user capabilities and preferences which is strongly correlated with the prime challenges of AAL.

In many situations it is useful to detect where to are people looking for, e.g. in exhibits, commercial mals, and public places in buildings. Our application is designed to work with surveillance cameras that are already available in those places, and do not imply an extra acquisition cost. The paper begins with a review of techniques used for face detection, a brief introduction to the OpenCV library, and of the requirements for the application. We then describe our approach, and present the main algorithms we used. We then perform an evaluation of the application, analyzing its performance throughout the processing, and analyze the accuracy of the recognition. We performed tests in real-time and off-line. The results are encouraging, and we identify limitations and improvements that can be introduced to decrease the error rate.",

Cardiotocography is the method which allows studying this frequency and its variations as a response to the uterine activity, allowing the interpretation of the different fetal behavioral states. The aim of this work is to assess the performance of different machine learning algorithms for cardiotocography exams classification. Two classification tasks are considered: the first corresponds to characterizing the exam according to the fetal state; the second corresponds to classifying the exam according to the morphological pattern. Our experimental results indicate that the tested algorithms have a promising performance for both tasks. Among the checked algorithms, Random Forest has the best results, achieving an accuracy of 94,9% for the fetal state classification task and an accuracy of 87,3% for the morphological pattern task.",

However, it does not matter if the search space has several valid solutions, as their classic approach is insufficient. To this end, the idea of dividing the individuals into species has been successfully raised. However, this solution is not free of drawbacks, such as the emergence of redundant species, overlapping or performance degradation by significantly increasing the number of individuals to be evaluated.

Environmental protection is a matter of growing concern among the citizens, the European Union in particular not to talk about worldwide environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). E-work has the ability to improve the environment as it will effectively reduce road traffic pollution, lower energy consumption and diminish the desertification of inner regions thus potentiating rural development.

Some dimensions have the particularity of evolving through time, either by having new data or by changes that occur in source systems and must be reflected in the data warehouses. Dealing with these, so called, Slowly Changing Dimensions is a complex task that the Extract, Transform and Load process is responsible. Common approaches are based on typing these dimensions and act accordingly, which adds to the already complex nature of the process. In this paper we analyze these different types of slowly changing dimensions, proposing a relational algebra specification to deal with them.",

Following some researchers, this trend will continue over the next years. Cloud computing is a new concept based on a well-know model named “pay-as-you-go”. There is a new concept dubbed PACS Cloud, which the fundamental idea is to do PACS outsourcing taking advantages of the clouds elasticity and scalability, avoiding hardware obsolescence, providing universal access to the information anywhere, anytime and increase the data availability. This paper presents a module of PACS Cloud architecture to grant interoperability with DICOM devices. PACS Cloud Gateway is a component of PACS Cloud, which focuses mainly on the translation from DICOM commands to non-DICOM and vice-versa. While data outsource to the cloud can relieve users from the burden of local storage and maintenance, it also brings new security concerns. This paper presents a secure PACS Cloud Gateway to access PACS Cloud archive, which provides a high security level and without cloud's provider dependence. The workflows of each process was described carefully, specifying data flows since that Gateway is contacted by DICOM device, until it releases the process. Finally, the platform was instantiated in biggest Internet Cloud providers and the solution's results was analysed.",

Thus, the knowledge is preserved and made it transmission to subsequent generations ensuring their own survival and evolution of the human race. With the advent of information produced digitally, it is necessary to ensure new mechanisms for sharing preserve those digital contents in this new “information society”. Regarding health, we find that the available repositories are mostly institutional which prevents the submission of digital contents and their preservation by independent professionals, researchers and students who are not part of them. It also denotes that these repositories have a lot of thesis, leaving out other multimedia resources such as images, videos, 3D models, animations, clinical exams, case studies, among others. The creation of a non-institutional thematic repository aims to contribute to a further spread of this type of resources cataloged with metadata in a global level and provide digital preservation thereof. This paper presents the steps for creating a thematic repository for healthcare.",

These became increasingly lighter and cheaper, and transferred from the office to the car, to equipment and other utensils. The amount of (digital) information available in the environment has increased exponentially, requiring a technological response in order to improve and facilitate its access and assimilation. The concept of Augmented Reality acts as a bridge between real and digital inviting to new models of user interaction. The AR incorporation is intended primarily to make systems more usable by decreasing the need of cognitive load inherent to their use. This paper presents a case study, proposing a model for a Learning Object using Augmented Reality, studying the integration of augmented reality and multimedia techniques combined with other conventional materials researching how they may contribute to increase motivation and perceived towards knowledge.",

In our research we analyse several defects classifiers; select the ones applicable to requirements specifications, following rules to build defects taxonomies; and assess the classification validity in an experiment of requirements defects classification performed by graduate and undergraduate students. Not all subjects used the same type of defect to classify the same defect, which suggests that defects classification is not consensual.

This location takes an important role because it can help rectify trajectories (in the case of autonomous objects) or improve the performance (in the case of sport practices). In this research project, a system based on RFID that automatically rectifies a location and calculates a wheelchair trajectory in a pre-defined route will be presented. For that, a commercial location system was used as well as a wheelchair and two routes: a linear one and a complex route. In order to correct the trajectory a low pass filter was also used. The obtained results showed that this approach decreased 38% of the mean squared error and in more than 7 centimeters the maximum error. In the future this research work will be enclosed in a new project where a multi agent system capable of executing a management of an autonomous wheelchair set in a hospital environment will be developed.",

Also, we present a fourth approach combining by stacking generalisation the two best classifiers. We used the FAU Aibo Corpus to work under real-life conditions, dealing with spontaneous speech and with low emotional expressiveness, unbalanced data, non-prototypical emotions and a garbage class. Experiments were carried out using the leave-one-speaker-out strategy to consider speaker independence. Two different training and test sets were used at the end to validate the results. We selected the two best classifiers to be merged by comparing the results obtained in the leave-one-speaker-out stage. Experiments showed that the fusion of these classifiers resulted in a more robust structure when it had to classify previously unseen data.",

The integration of these developments can provide a superior experience, greater than the sum of their individual contributions, regarding user satisfaction. This paper proposes an integration of all these innovations in e-tourism, more specifically by the development of a Web based geographic information platform adaptable to any tourist region. As a case study, we also show how this platform was adapted to the Douro region, in Portugal. The Web platform developed as a proof of concept combines geospatial information from diverse and heterogeneous data sources, encompassing events, news, routes and points of interest (POI). This platform provides also a recommendation engine and features the possibility that users can contribute with content as part of the community, thus emerging a mini social network.",

The study aims to find out what tools and practices were used by students in activities related to learning and day-to-day (leisure and socialization) activities, trying to establish a relationship between social and academic use of these tools. The results point to a distinctive use regarding the two types of activities, with a preference for traditional means of interaction in the classroom and the access to traditional contents in a passive way. These results confirm recent studies that say that the generational split between natives and digital immigrants is a myth, and that the skills and enthusiasm for Web 2.0 tools of the digital native students are overstated and that the generation gap is not observed in learning activities.",

    "abstract": "There are different definitions for ontologies. Different knowledge areas tend to define ontologies in a different way. For computer science, an ontology can be used to describe, in a well defined and structured way, knowledge about a specific domain. These artifacts store rich information that can be reasoned about, this information can also be target of many structured processing functions. There is a diversity of programs that can be implemented to take advantage of these features and produce applications in every area of knowledge. The Ontology Manipulation Language (OML) is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to describe and execute operations that reason about ontologies. These reasoning operations can be used to manipulate and maintain the current information in the ontology, infer new knowledge or concepts, or even produce any kind of side effect. OML is a simple and descriptive language, yet it is powerful enough to implement complex operations or reasoning engines in a clear and efficient way. To actually run programs written in OML a standalone compiler is available, as well as a mechanism for embedding OML programs in a generic programming language. This allows the quick development of applications that make use of ontologies, by describing ontology related operations in wove OML snippets throughout the code. This mechanism has proven to be a very effective and clear approach for taking advantage of adopting ontologies to represent information, while maintaining the implicit advantages of using a general-goal programming language.",

Students participated in 75 randomly selected samples do not have that corresponded to only three classes in science and technology existing in the school where the study took place. From the methodological point of view it was decided to design a quantitative approach with quasi-experimental approach combined with a qualitative description and interpretation of the process. As data collection instruments were used two questionnaires: One of “Attitudes to the computer and the Internet” and the other “The use of computers and the Internet.” The questionnaires were administered by teachers of each class in Biology / Geology under the guidance of one of the authors. The results showed that sex had no significant influence, but age seems to affect the attitude toward the computer as well as regular use in the context of the classroom.",

This study aimed to develop a prototype that could contribute to the identification of data quality problems in clinical and administrative health databases. In addition to the definition of requirements and business rules, used methods involved the development and testing of a prototype. The prototype was tested using a national database containing more than 11 million discharges in Portuguese acute care public hospitals. Several problems and inconsistencies were found with the use of the prototype. For instance, 82,422 episodes (15%) had diagnostic codes that do not exist in the lookup ICD-9-CM table. Results show that this prototype contributes to the detection of data quality problems. In addition, this prototype can be an incentive for the improvement of the architecture of nowadays information systems, highlighting the importance of the developing of mechanisms for the detection and validation of healthcare data.",

WSNs are emerging as a new paradigm, gathering information in a collaborative way, where independent sensor nodes collect and share information. In the last few years ubiquitous computing popularity has grown considerably, ambient intelligence and home automation systems are having a good public acceptance. In this context, we developed a mobile application to remotely monitor one WSN, installed at a customer's home. The application's main goal is to interact with a WSN, allowing a user to consult sensor states and receive sensor alerts. Sensor alerts will be received, in case a sensor's threshold value, exceeds the limit. Therefore the user will be notified whenever there are changes in the WSN. Apart the WSN, a base station is also needed for keeping the state of the WSN, store sensor's information and enable communication between the WSN and the developed mobile application via Web Services. This way and having a network connection, the user can check the state of any WSN component, anytime, anywhere. The Android platform was chosen to implement our application, since it is having a great acceptance and continued growth in the mobile market.",

Studies show that this process is far from slowing down, it's beginning to emerge concerns regarding the territory over the occupation and the consequent imbalance of urban spaces. However, it is believed that if there is proper monitoring of its expansion, including its infrastructures, growth can be achieved in a balanced and sustainable way. The completion of this expansion is dependent on a decision process that needs to be clear, reasoned and defensible. The Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are tools that help the stance with these characteristics. It is presented a SDSS prototype for the strategic analysis of the expansion of the urban networks of sanitation and water supply systems.",

In this work, we contextualize the cognitive biometrics in the biometry in general, taking into account how one can measure the performance of a biometric system. We intend to conduct a literature review in a particular area of information security, in order to foresee possible lines of research. Scientific studies show that biological signals captured through electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrodermal responses (EDR), using electrodes placed on specific body parts, guarantee the possibility of authentication of individuals and its identification, in some cases. This can be useful for the most demanding security systems, using these techniques individually or on a combination of different biometric techniques, so that the recognition process is more efficient.",

Their applications are of great interest not only in mathematics and physics but also in engineering applications or in biology and ecology. We propose an accessible educational tool for the implementation and design of new, fundamental or simple chaotic systems using the PSpice code. It is a versatile software applied to electronic nonlinear oscillations modeled on a Network Simulation Method (NSM) which uses an electronic analogy. Students can implement and “see” the chaotic dynamics and the fundamental properties of the chaotic attractors. They can perform the synchronization between two or more chaotic oscillators, and also synchronize complex systems. In this work we have constructed several examples, among them a new Jerk system, using this model. Thanks to the simplicity of the NSM model and Probe Window System, simulations can be performed more easily and at a fraction of the time required using other methods of traditional designs using, for example, Spice or Matlab.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a preliminary analysis of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the context of Higher Education (HE) takes place. This analysis seeks to verify if it there has been, in particular, a change of practice by teachers and whether this occurrence could be related to the introduction of the Bologna model, making the teaching process more dynamic, less expository and more supported by ICT. As a primary basis of work, the adoption of platforms for online learning and its impact on teaching and learning model in the ES are questioned, with reference to the integration of the MOODLE platform in Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP). In this case, it was found that there is a low level of adherence to the use of the teaching online platform, even in its simplest form of information repository, and some resistance on the part of teachers was detected (even regarding the use the platform in the context of blended-learning - b-Learning).",

    "abstract": "Module management support is very rough in the C and C++ programming languages. Modules must be separated in interface and implementation files, which will store declarations and definitions, respectively. Ultimately, only text substitution tools are available, by means of the C/C++ preprocessor, which is able to insert an interface file in a given point of a translation unit. This way of managing modules does not take into account aspects like duplicated inclusions, or proper separation of declarations and definitions, just to name a few. While the seasoned programmer will find this characteristic of the language annoying and error-prone, students will find it not less than challenging. In this document, a tool specially designed for improving the support of modules in C++ is presented. Its main advantage is that it makes it easier to manage large, module-based projects, while still allowing to use classic translation units. This tool is designed for students who have to learn modular programming; not only those in the computer science discipline, but also those in other engineerings in which programming is part of the curriculum.",

Both static and mobile devices are a general tendency to maximize the size and screen resolution in line with the intrinsic ability of technology to generate high-resolution images and create an immersive scene. Problems arises when the size or screen resolution is reduced or the amount of information to show increases. The architecture framework is a clear example where the visualization and evaluation of the information is more critical. In this paper we performed a user study' focused on evaluating the features of the digital images related with architectural framework viewed on mobile screen in order to improve the adaptation of different type of images to different type of users.",

    "abstract": "Portugal, like other European states, has conducted educational policies and reforms to achieve common goals regarding the European education space. These reforms seek to create an education system based on skills development, and not on the transmission of knowledge, which included the implementation of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees, designed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. This changings was supported on a credit system (ECTS) and the adoption of the Diploma Supplement by all countries involved. However, when we do a search on the Internet we find an enormous diversity in the description of the Portuguese modules that integrate the curricula of undergraduate and master's degrees. The access to this information is not always available in the official courses websites, thereby students have difficult making a decision when trying to join in a mobility program. In this context, this article describes the process of data collection performed in order to determine the most relevant elements used to define a courses by teachers and to evaluate the importance of the descriptors suggested in the ECTS system. This process ends with the development of a prototype for the definition of courses. Rather than building a technologically advanced application, this prototype had as its primary objective the establishment of a “common language” in the definition of each unit that is really useful and to facilitate student mobility at national and European level.",

    "abstract": "The persistence concern implemented as an aspect has been studied since the appearance of the Aspect-Oriented paradigm. Frequently, persistence is given as an example that can be aspectized, but until today no real world solution has applied that paradigm. Such solution should be able to enhance the programmer productivity and make the application less prone to errors. To test the viability of that concept, in a previous study we developed a prototype that implements Orthogonal Persistence as an aspect. This first version of the prototype was already fully functional with all Java types including arrays. In this work the results of our new research to overcome some limitations that we have identified on the data type abstraction and transparency in the prototype are presented. One of our goals was to avoid the Java standard idiom for genericity, based on casts, type tests and subtyping. Moreover, we also find the need to introduce some dynamic data type abilities. We consider that the Reflection is the solution to those issues. To achieve that, we have extended our prototype with a new static weaver that preprocesses the application source code in order to introduce changes to the normal behavior of the Java compiler with a new generated reflective code.",

    "abstract": "News recommendation has become an increasingly popular area of research for both the academic researcher and the commercial practitioner. Recently, a “semantic approach” to news recommendation has become popular. Semantic news recommendation normally relies upon a manually constructed domain Ontology and a user profile. The current semantic news recommenders have their flaws: 1. constructing and maintaining a manual Ontology is a manually intensive and laborious task, 2. user profiles may inhibit the selection of novel, but interesting stories which are atypical of the user's previous selections and 3. the current approach semantic approaches ignores the “importance” of a story to the monitored domain. This paper describes Magellan (Magalhães), a semantic recommendation system which ranks “breaking financial news” by their “importance” to a monitored domain. In addition Magellan uses an automatically constructed and maintained adaptive Ontology which autonomously discovers new relations and entities whist removing outdated or erroneous information. Magellan applies a “temporal confidence” to each relation and once a relation's “temporal confidence” falls below a preassigned constant it is removed. The ranking of stories is with a “weighted term frequency” (WTF) scheme. The domain Ontology is used to identify relevant terms in candidate stories. A term's weight is determined by its: 1. Centrality and 2. Prestige (which incorporates a relation's temporal confidence). An evaluation of Magellan with an inverted index and a semantic news recommender system with a static Ontology demonstrated a clear advantage for Magellan.",

    "abstract": "Log files are the history books of a computer system. In particular, they tell a good portion of the security related events and menaces that a system has to withstand and, sometimes, fails to resist to. Therefore, log files' analysis can be valuable to system and security administrators if the difficulty of extracting the relevant information of the different kinds of data and formats can be surmounted. And if we consider a huge system in terms of users, services and accesses, the difficulty of the analysis task rises enormously. In infra-structures where there is more than one server and communication link, it is possible for the administrator and security team to configure all systems to record their logs in a central huge repository, but the search for abnormalities is quite impossible without specialized tools. As we believe that the collected information on log files can be valuable, we use information retrieval open source tools to index the log files' fields and search for patterns of suspected behavior, which may indicate a system intrusion. Our development allows queries based on variables introduced by the analyst. The preliminary results obtained when using log files from an academic institution indicates that our approach is effective and can be used as a security aid.",

Poor interfaces entail frustration for the user and reduce the system's usefulness. Thus all elements of Graphical User Interfaces should be subjected to localization and a variable menu structure should be part of the goals of software localization efforts. Considering the extensive use of XML in the implementation of hierarchical menu structures, we propose to use an implementation approach for the local adaptation of menus that is equivalent to the procedure used to create an XLIFF file. The locally adapted menu structure can then be merged with the translated content into a target localized XML document.",

    "abstract": "As empresas buscam sua sustentabilidade desenvolvendo, cotidianamente, novas estratégias de negócios. O incentivo natural para a persistência nessa busca, comum no meio dos negócios, é a globalização. O sucesso dessas estratégias acaba atraindo investidores, pois corrobora com o retorno para seus investimentos. Nesse processo, a segurança das informações garante um alicerce estável para o desenvolvimento dos negócios. Na década de 90 a segurança das informações não despertava a atenção necessária dos gestores, com respeito à sua confidencialidade e autenticidade, fato que fez com que algumas empresas norte-americanas, que comercializavam seus papéis na New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) e National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), puderam fraudar seus resultados financeiros, gerando uma imagem de estabilidade irreal. Essa situação gerou um grande impacto, negativo, no grau de confiança dos investidores e colocou em cheque a governança corporativa mundial. Esse impacto foi o fator motivador da criação da lei Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) como um organismo regulador e monitorador da integridade das informações. A lei SOX obrigou a adequação dos processos por meio de controles e registros, fato que gerou a necessidade de muitas adequações na área de Tecnologia da Informação (TI), principalmente com respeito às informações financeiras, envolvendo dessa maneira toda governança de Business Intelligence (BI). Este trabalho analisa a governança de BI, atendendo as exigências da lei SOX e conclui que a adequação à lei gera mudanças notáveis nos processos, criando registros de controle e mapeamento das atividades, tornando-as rastreáveis, além da responsabilidade direta dos gestores nas atividades envolvidas.",

A classroom of twenty students of the Sciences of Information career at Central University “Marta Abreu” of Las Villas (UCLV1) was inquired during the use of a wiki tool supporting a research workshop in the course of Databases Theory (DBT). The purpose of this study is to test the following hypotheses: (1) the collaboration supported by social software reinforces the peer relationships among the students of the class and (2) improves the time efficiency of the students and instructors (stakeholders) participating in these collaborative activities. A survey and several interviews were conducted to gather data about the social network the students formed for studying DBT, and about the time they spent on that. The results of these instruments were contrasted with the results of an observation conducted during the collaborative activities. The data of the students' achievements and social network state using the wiki tool were compared to similar data from other two precedent, non-wiki-supported research workshops. The use of the wiki tool was found effective to reinforce the peer learning relationships, and consequently, to improve their achievements on the subject. Finally, the time spent for accomplishing the collaborative learning activities did not decrease significantly during the use of the social software.",

An analysis of the efficiency and execution times of the comparison algorithms in which different optimizations are used is also done here. It is discussed to which extent the decreasing of the number of points in a track damages the quality of the solution reached. It is concluded that, within a certain range of optimization, this process has advantages given that it reduces algorithm execution time and keeps track comparison quality within rather reasonable levels.",

This information is necessary to comply with the law, e.g., to drive below speed limits, but also to other ends such as maintenance needs, current autonomy and operational status of internal components. Conventional dashboards use dedicated gauges that are fixed and cannot be changed easily. This conflicts with the current trend towards vehicles that are tailored to the customer at delivery time or that can be reconfigured during their lifetime, since modifications in the dashboard may be required. To cope with this trend, this paper proposes a new concept of dashboard, based on a hardware/software solution, using soft gauges implemented on a high resolution screen, thus being fully reconfigurable from design to delivery time or even during the vehicle lifetime. It can easily accommodate changes in the vehicle subsystems configuration but also provide different aesthetic options to the user. The proposed dashboard has been successfully applied to an experimental electric vehicle.",

Recognizing the global importance of forests in economic, environmental and social dimensions presents a new challenge for those interested in ensuring the sustainability of forest resources. Global connectivity provided by the Internet and the latest solutions based on open source and open standards/specifications made available by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) allowed the development of Distributed GIS (DGIS). These can be seen as true spatial data infrastructures (SDI), enabling multiple users and organizations to share multiple levels of geographic information (GI) and applications. This article establishes the role of DGIS based on open source software in forest management, describing an application created for a forestry organization. The introduction of the DGIS was made based on the assessment of the needs and on the model capability of overcoming some of the existing limitations using free and open source software.",

Security is equally important. Laboratory measurements are made about several performance aspects of Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b, g) WEP point-to-point links. A contribution is given to performance evaluation of this technology under WEP encryption, using two types of equipments (RBTR2 access points from Enterasys Networks and WRT54GL wireless routers from Linksys). Detailed results are presented and discussed, namely at OSI levels 4 and 7, from TCP, UDP and FTP experiments: TCP throughput, jitter, percentage datagram loss and FTP transfer rate. Comparisons are made and conclusions are drawn about the comparative performance of the links.",

This paper proposes a DQ model that can be used as a reference by project managers to assess and, if necessary, improve the quality of the data values corresponding to the metadata describing the artifacts used in the process of planning a software development project. For our research, we have identified the corresponding artifacts from those described as part of the Planning Process defined in international standard ISO / IEC 12207:2008. We have aligned these found artifacts with those proposed by PMBOK, in order to better depict their structure; and finally, we are to build our data quality model upon the DQ dimensions proposed by Strong, D. M., Y. W. Lee and Wang, R. in “Data Quality in Context.” Comm. of the ACM 1997 40 (5): 103-110.

In Portugal, according to the National Statistics Institute, 1,635 deaths due to female breast cancer occurred in the year 2009, accounting for near 4,900 new cases by year. This study aimed to describe and analyze data from hospital female breast cancer episodes, coded in Portuguese hospital databases. Specifically, it aimed to profile data quality and to identify inconsistencies, errors and outliers. The database used includes inpatient and outpatient episodes from all mainland acute care public hospitals of the Portuguese National Health Service, within years 2000 to 2008, corresponding to more than 10 million records. Empirical data analyses were performed to understand the data distribution and the profile of possible outliers. Many problems and inconsistencies were found as, for instance, the existence of 40% of female breast cancer episodes with a secondary diagnosis of “admission for radiotherapy and chemotherapy” and, also, 783 records with the variable gender filled with “male”. Systematic audits to the data and to the information produced, performed by competent agencies, can minimize some of the found problems. In fact, the knowledge of anomalous situations should allow, when feasible, an immediate improvement in the quality of healthcare data.",

These graphs typically involve a large number of data transformations and must handle large amounts of data. The involvement of the users who are responsible for executing data cleaning processes over real data is crucial to tune data transformations and to manually correct data items that cannot be automatically handled. In this paper, we extend the notion of data cleaning graph such that it can better support the user interaction in data cleaning processes. We propose that the data cleaning graphs contain: (i) data quality constraints to help users identifying the points in the graph and the records that require their attention; and (ii) manual data repairs that represent the way users can insert the knowledge that is required to manually clean some data records.",

These databases are the base for hospital financing and for the process of contracting between hospitals and regional health authorities. This data is also used for the production of indicators describing the quality of care and measuring hospital performance. In this context, the variable Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) plays a central role, because its codes are used to distinguish/select various types of episodes, for instance, the obstetric ones. Since the assignment of a hospitalization episode to a DRG is based on information extracted from a set of variables, the existence of possible coding or data quality problems associated with these variables can influence the outcome of the grouping process. In this article we highlight some of these problems associated with obstetric episodes, aiming primarily to alert to the possibility of the loss of some information, when episodes are counted using only DRG codes. As a result we present a new approach for the counting of obstetric episodes, the ObsCount algorithm, which can be used in the calculation of indicators in this medical specialty.",

From previous studies, we identified as a research opportunity the potential benefits of the adoption of more natural interaction modalities. This paper describes the main problems and how serious games and NUI can benefit the process of rehabilitation. We describe our recent work on this subject, including the design of a game prototype using alternative (in respect to the conventional WIMP) interaction. We conducted a playability study in order to make it possible to evaluate and measure the benefits of the newer forms of interaction. From the results study, we concluded that the introduction of the natural interaction modalities has increased the attractiveness and intuitiveness of the prototyped Serious Game. Lastly, we report some conclusions and identify research opportunities and open problems in this area.",

The project consists in the development of a generic platform capable of creating any kind of abstract strategy game, and is essentially divided in three phases: research on related topics, design and specification and lastly the development of a working prototype. Through the analysis of similarities between game mechanics this project intends to define abstract games in a generic fashion, as well as enabling users to easily define their own games, ultimately allowing for the creation of a working prototype. The prototype is a software tool that allows users to create several distinct abstract games through a series of options, which define the games' rules. This project opens up the possibility to easily create and test games, without the need to program them. It represents a step forward in abstract game creation and can be a catalyst to Artificial Intelligence research, by allowing rapid testing of perfect information game puzzles ideal for Artificial Intelligence search algorithms.",

    "abstract": "News can contain information which may provide an indication of the future direction of a share or stock market index. The possibility of predicting future stock market prices has attracted an increasing numbers of industry practitioners and academic researchers to this area of investigation. Popular approaches have relied upon either: models constructed from manually selected training or manually constructed dictionaries. A potential flaw of manually selecting data is that the effectiveness of the trained model is dependent upon the ability of the human annotator. An alternative approach is to align news stories with trends in a specific market. A negative story is inferred if it co-occurs with a market losing value where as positive story is associated with a rise. This approach may have its flaws because news stories may co-occur with market movements by chance and consequently may inhibit the construction of a robust classifier with data gathered with this method. This paper presents a strategy which combines a: rule classifier, alignment strategy and self-training to induce a robust model for classifying news stories. The proposed method is compared with several competing methodologies and is evaluated with: estimated F-Measure and estimated trading returns. In addition the paper provides an evaluation of classifying a news story with it's: headline, description or story text. The results demonstrate a clear advantage for the proposed methodology when evaluated by estimated F-Measure. The proposed strategy also produces the highest trading returns. In addition the paper clearly demonstrates that a news story's headline provides the greatest assistance for classification. The models induced from headlines gained the highest estimated F-Measure and trading returns for each strategy with the exception of the alignment method which performed uniformly poorly.",

These scenarios are particularly challenging for text classification techniques, and the availability of reference corpora is one important bottleneck for developing and testing new classification strategies. We propose a semiautomatic approach for creating a reference corpus that uses three auxiliary classification methods - one based on Support Vector Machines, one based on Nearest Neighbor Classifiers and another based on a dictionary-based classification heuristic - for suggesting to human annotators topic-related labels that can be used to describe different facets of a given news item being annotated. Using such approach, we semi-automatically produce a corpus of 1,600 news items with 865 different labels, having in average 3.63 labels per news item. We evaluate the contribution of each of the auxiliary classification methods to the annotation process and we conclude that: (i) none of the methods alone is capable of suggesting all relevant labels, (ii) a dictionary-based classification heuristic contributes significantly and (iii) the Nearest Neighbor classifier performs very efficiently in the most extreme multi-label part of the problem and is robust to the very unbalanced item-to-class distribution.",

    "abstract": "Developing computer programs that play Poker at human level is considered to be challenge to the A.I. research community, due to its incomplete information and stochastic nature. Due to these characteristics of the game, a competitive agent must manage luck and use opponent modeling to be successful at short term and therefore be profitable. In this paper we propose the creation of No Limit Hold'em Poker agents by copying strategies of the best human players, by analyzing past games between them. To accomplish this goal, first we determine the best players on a set of game logs by determining which ones have higher winning expectation. Next, we define a classification problem to represent the player strategy, by associating a game state with the performed action. To validate and test the defined player model, the HoldemML framework was created. This framework generates agents by classifying the data present on the game logs with the goal to copy the best human player tactics. The created agents approximately follow the tactics from the counterpart human player, thus validating the defined player model. However, this approach proved to be insufficient to create a competitive agent, since the generated strategies were static, which means that they are easy prey to opponents that can perform opponent modeling. This issue can be solved by combining multiple tactics from different players. This way, the agent switches the tactic from time to time, using a simple heuristic, in order to confuse the opponent modeling mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Recently there has been a growing interest by the sports' community (educators and coaches) in analyzing efficiently the performance of handball players and teams. The information collected from such analysis is used to better understand the difficulties of trainees, players or even entire teams and formulate adequate training and strategic plans. Usually this evaluation is too self contained and does not explore the many tools there are available nowadays. This paper proposes a simulation tool to tackle this problem and establishes the bases for a Handball Sport Simulator. The simulator developed has its origins on the Soccer Server simulator used on the RoboCup competition and includes the main handball game rules and player actions. This paper establishes the ground foundations for a Handball Simulator and results show that the handball rules and actions can be modeled.",

Therefore, designing and dimensioning airport terminals' curbsides are major steps to improve passengers' experience. Indeed, evaluating such design is a critical task that must be performed to point out the best solution. This paper reports our modeling, implementing, and evaluating two curbside scenarios: one as currently applied to the Portela Airport, in Lisbon, and another alternative as proposed by a Transport Consultancy Agency. Our contribution results in the creation of a broader methodology to evaluate various scenarios, in addition to determining the best scenario between the ones presented and discussed in this paper. Some preliminary experiments are carried out, whose results are presented and discussed so as to compare their efficiency. Finally, we draw some conclusions and point out ways in which this work can be further extended.",

With advances in computer and communication technology, elevating thus the user to a central concern rather than favoring performance only, both the scientific community and practitioners are in search for adequate ways to model and assess new performance measures brought about by FUT's requirements. After identifying such requirements, we'll try to propose taxonomy on the basis of diverse criteria to assess how suitable currently available simulation packages are to assess Future Urban Transport. Some tools are compared and their ability to suit these needs is discussed, resulting in a first appraisal of suitability of existing microscopic traffic simulation tools. On the basis of the agent metaphor and the concept of multi-agent systems, we suggest ways in which to follow up this work.",

The movements' coordination is performed with the aid of a music analyzer that estimates the beat of the music and calculates a prediction of the next inter-beat-interval (IBI). During the robot dancing performance, a dance movement is chosen from a pre-defined dance library and is executed on-the-fly by the robot. The movements' velocity, as well as the attended metrical-level, are adjusted in real time so that the movement can be executed within the time interval of two beats, and at the same time taking into consideration the robot motor-rates limitations. Results evince a good synchrony of the movement towards the analyzed rhythm, but points to the need of a careful design of the dance movements so they can be naturally executed on time.",
