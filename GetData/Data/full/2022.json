    "abstract": "Through the E-government systems, the tax administrations of the different levels of government interrelate with their target user, in this case the taxpayer, ensuring that the latter achieves compliance with its tax obligations in an agile, timely and efficient manner, promoting in turn, the construction of public values in this interested party. However, it is important to assess whether these information systems (IS) having the capabilities to meet the objectives pre-established by this type of organization, which have missions, interest groups, perspectives, contexts, factors and particular benefits compared to other government entities, and in which its success or failure, influences government finances and the development of a territory. Therefore, this document proposes the construction of a model for evaluating the success of E-government systems for tax administrations, which proposes a particular and not a general character, where the traditional factors of success theories must be complemented with relevant constructs to this context, such as: demographic considerations, the capacity for timely parameterization due to regulatory changes (flexibility), the digital gap, allowing to classify its benefits from social, economic, individual, organizational, environmental and public value aspects, developing in this way a holistic model for this type of government organization, seeking that the taxpayer and their intermediaries are the protagonists of this assessment.",

These systems are being developed to help tourists find sites and services that are of interest to them. To promote tourism in a city, this paper presents an enhanced user-based collaborative filtering approach with demographic information for recommending touristic sites, which provides precise recommendations. The collaborative filtering approach recommends touristic sites considering two user types: new tourist and registered tourist. In this way, the recommendations of tourist sites are generated according to the user's historical rating or based on the user's demographic information. The approach is evaluated on a tourist sites dataset extracted from the TripAdvisor platform that contains historical ratings, and demographic information of the tourist. To measure the performance of the proposed approach, RMSE is used to evaluate predictions accuracy, and Precision and Recall measures to evaluate the quality of recommendations. The results showed an improvement in the prediction accuracy and a significant performance with precision and recall, especially in the presence of the cold-start problem.",

The objective of this work was to determine the application of the technological tools YouTube and Zoom, as interactive resources in the development of the teaching-learning process of a primary institution in Ecuador. For this, a case study is presented, where a quantitative methodology was applied, with a descriptive-correlational type of study, considering the total population of fifth grade students to whom a previously structured survey and interviews with teachers were applied. In this context, it is concluded based on the results that the use of YouTube and Zoom contribute significantly to the teaching-learning process, however, little knowledge is reflected in the teachers regarding the use of its functionalities, which compromises the adequate development of the apprenticeships.",

We address the illustrative Engineering problem permitting, in this view, to combine the Web and suitable computer languages: PHP, Python, Fortran, gnuplot. The study has as objectives: to compute the parameters mentioned, key in the use of a superabsorbent; to serve as a template for other problems; and, more broadly, to draw attention both to the use of the Web for scientific computing, and to the convenience of this use in scientific publications (the \"simple science\"). This study points to and advocates web-based computing in general, which can use the same executable programs as classical computing, which is the typical hard task.

The use of automated devices to support CPR training through real-time feedback are considered an important educational tool, optimizing CPR skills acquisition and knowledge retention. Considering this educational need, this paper presents the development of a controlled-cost feedback device for CPR training, with focus on chest compression quality. Several sensory approaches were tested for functionality and performance, leading to the selection of a digital infrared sensor combined with a piezoresistive pressure sensor. This approach showed a good response and robustness to chest compressions during CPR training, providing accurate assessment of specific parameters of chest compressions. Usability testing, mimicking a training-like situation, showed promising results and confirmed the applicability of this approach to real-time training or post-training analysis. It is expected that the proposed solution could provide an alternative or a complementary tool for CPR skills acquisition and maintenance, promoting regular training and to a broader population.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by COVID 19 has generated crowds of people, this becomes a critical point that leads to a safe contagion. And it is for this reason that the idea of a virtual tour was born so that people can get to know the physical facilities of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) through a virtual environment. Universidad Tecnológica Israel (UISRAEL), does not have a digital space where its different areas can be appreciated by means of a 3D virtual tour. In this sense, this work presents the development of a 3D model, offering the user a digital interaction of the physical space from his home on his computer. The main benefit is that the user can get to know the facilities in an almost real way, generating a sense of orientation. This work has given way to a future virtual community at UISRAEL, making it possible to diversify and face the new challenges that virtualization brings with it. It will not only be a new means of information and communication, but also a space for interaction, entertainment and learning. All this leaves the basis for an application that in the future could develop more functionalities and be used in other research projects.",

With this work we sought to talk about influencer marketing, but through the user's perspective and in a sector of which there is not enough information, such as the eSports market. The objective of the research is to express, through semi-structured interviews, the perception of the viewers of the League of Legends community about influencer marketing used by eSports streamers on Twitch. Additionally, the specific objectives were to expose the community's opinion about the brands involved in eSports, to identify the users' reasons for following a streamer, and to identify the streamer's influence on the purchase decision of the members of the community. It was concluded that among the main reasons for watching streams are entertainment, identification with the streamer and learning about the game. It was also discovered that although brands have great value in themselves, influencers' recommendations enhance this value thanks to their high level of expertise, authority and trust.",

The starting question that originated this article is: is Portugal receptive to the use of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence in retail? In other words, what is the opinion of the Portuguese and residents in Portugal, as consumers, regarding the use of automation by retail companies? Based on the analysis of the answers to an online questionnaire (which obtained 132 answers), we will present our conclusions regarding this matter. The goal is to understand if Portuguese people / residents in Portugal are willing and interested in going to supermarkets like Amazon Go or Continente Labs (or Pingo Doce & GO NOVA). In addition, it is intended to understand the reasons that lead them to respond skeptically, so that, in the future, strategies may be initiated by the companies of the sector, which based on greater and better education, may clarify, and perhaps change their assumptions and convictions. The results of this study reveal that the Portuguese and residents in Portugal are not yet interested in using automated supermarkets, showing some mistrust and reticence towards this new technology, although they recognize that it can increase the speed and efficiency of the service. In fact, of the 37,1% of respondents that consider it quite attractive, about 84% believe it may have a significant impact on the reduction of time spent shopping.",

Inside this concept, this article uses the theoretical framework Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) to assess users’ interest in new technologies developed within the scope of open banking. A survey was carried out through a structured online questionnaire with 100 potential users and then the data were analyzed using the PLS-SEM approach. Results indicate that perceived usefulness is affected by optimism, discomfort, and insecurity, while perceived ease of use is affected only by innovativeness and discomfort. Considering that the cultural context of a country influences technology acceptance models, the present study aims to contribute to the literature, offering a view of the potential for Open Banking adoption among the portion of the population that will be users of this technology in a developing country.",

The combination of these approaches provides a better understanding of the scenario alternatives available to decision makers. This is, recognizing the context of the focal question with creative scenario plots that show the interaction between its key drivers. Therefore, the hybrid model, should be useful to unify the strategic point of view by recognizing the most plausible scenario, while reducing the uncertainty due to ambiguous value judgments by Key Decision Makers (KDMs).The work presented in this article aims to develop hybrid model by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to engage a new non-linear form of systems thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental case that develops a case for rethinking the ideas of a research system for a local organization.The article ends with a reflection on outcomes and suggests ways for future research.",

    "abstract": "Android is the most widespread operating systems for mobile devices. The Android permission system controls what apps are permitted to access device data and resources. To get access, apps must request permissions. Our proposal aims to obtain a user-friendly metric for device owners that provides them with guidance on the privacy risk they take when they install an app on their device. The metric is based on permissions. As a relevant novelty compared to previous proposals, we propose to use permission groups as one of its parameters. Permission groups express concepts that are more accessible to users than individual permissions. Moreover, what users really grant are groups. We thus introduce the criterion of usability.",

    "abstract": "Optimization techniques have increasingly been applied in industrial environments over the past years. Even so, requirements and restrictions of real world problems, like technical standards and including physical impossibilities, are not so easy to include. Often, these constraints are hard coded in the computer program and the user cannot update them without the help of a programmer. In most cases, they are used as must regions in the search space. However, in real world problems the restrictions usually are not so strict. Expert systems have a knowledge base that resides outside of the computer program and relies on a set of rules that can be easily updated by the user. Fuzzy logic can make flexible the restrictions provided by specialists’ knowledge about the problem. This paper aims to propose a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to better handle the constraints in real life engineering and business optimization problems. The proposed system was tested for optimizing an engineering problem comparing two known swarm algorithms, PSO and wFSS. The latter one is multimodal and suggest multiple feasible solutions, which is even better for supporting decisions. The results of the study show that the proposed method can achieve good and feasible solutions on the given problems and, consequently, increase competitiveness.",

However, in order to decrease the cost associated to develop and test the IoT system it can be previously simulated. In this regard, designing IoT simulation environments has been tackled focusing on low level aspects such as networks, motes and so on more than focusing on the high level concepts related to IoT environments. Model-driven development aims to develop the software systems from domain models which capture at high level the domain concepts and relationships, generating from them the software artefacts by using code-generators. In this paper, a model-driven development approach is applied to define, generate code and deploy IoT systems simulations. The IoT simulation environment generated from each model includes the sensors, actuators, fog nodes, cloud nodes and analytical characteristics. Additionally, a case study, focused on an Industrial IoT environment is presented to show the simulation expressiveness.",

Spectral data from samples of tomatoes without pesticides and samples impregnated with chlorantraniliprole and flonicamid pesticide, were acquired by both the low cost and Pika L cameras. The Regions of Interest (ROIs) were determined and the averaged spectral value of these ROIs were calculated as the representative spectrum of each of them. Finally, the following classification models were performed with 720 ROIs: support vector classifier (SVC), K nearest neighbor, decision trees and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Furthermore, feature selection was carried out to select the main variables or wavelength bands. According to the values obtained for accuracy, recall, f1-score and precision, the best model for chlorantraniliprole detection was the MLP (accuracy=0.9). The preliminary results confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging to detect pesticide residues on tomatoes.",

    "abstract": "The identification of anomalies (such as bone fractures or tendonitis in muscles and soft tissues) through image processing and analysis techniques in Computed Tomography (CT) images is today of great importance to assist doctors and health professionals in making accurate diagnoses. The extraction of relevant information from the CT image is characterized by the calculation of gray level input image attributes. Statistical moments (SM) are calculated using the gray level distribution of an image and are therefore generally calculated from that image's histogram. These characteristics provide a statistical description of the relationship between different gray levels in the CT image. Haralick proposed a methodology for describing textures based on second order statistics, where characteristics are derived from co-occurrence matrices, which are constructed by counting different combinations of gray levels in an image according to certain directions. In this work, it is intended to automatically identify and extract regions in CT images based on textures as an aid for a quick and accurate diagnosis. CT images are first pre-processed for noise reduction and image enhancement, followed by the application of Haralick textures to segment and detect zones of interest. Classifiers trained on the Haralick invariant features showed good accuracy and performance. Despite the presence of low contrast and noise in some images, the proposed algorithms present promising results in the segmentation and automatic identification of regions of tomographic images, being an important contribution to support health professionals in the characterization of anomalies and their extension. Good results are expected for the next step of this work in the detection and segmentation of anomalies in CT images.",

Such an evaluation was conducted by matching the concepts of different feedback mechanisms and evaluation criteria involving feedback. The evaluation results indicate that all the evaluated SGs present at least the \"immediate feedback on my actions\" mechanism in their dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of the number of stakeholders, information systems used, and port operations evoke new challenges to port security when it comes to the total knowledge and control of the overall operations of transport and parking of containerized freight, namely hazmat ones.The rising interest and the port authorities' awareness of the relevance of security concerns involved in this complex ecosystem has led to the search for new technological solutions that allow, in an integrated manner, the smart and automatic control of operations of transport and hazardous freight parking in all the areas of its jurisdiction, without third-party dependencies.Despite its importance and criticality, port authorities tend to have limited real-time knowledge of the location of hazmat containers, whether moving within the port (entering and leaving), or in its parking, having a direct impact on the port security.This article presents a Digital Twin platform for 3D and real-time georeferenced visualization of container parks and the location of hazardous containerized freight. This tool combines different modules that further allow to visualize information associated to a container, its movement, as well as its surrounding area, including a realistic and dynamic 3D representation of what is the area encircling the port.",

This paper presents an irrigation system set on an IoT platform, it is possible to act in real time accordingly to the atmospheric/weather conditions. So, through parameterized and automated systems, it is possible to stop the irrigation plan of a garden, green space, or agricultural land. Later, using sensors, the system may or may not be activated in case the levels of soil moisture and luminosity do not respond to the parameterized needs. It is an efficient and sustainable solution that is available for all agriculture irrigation systems. To test the solution, unit tests were made, and a group of tests with all sensors connected was also done. This system implements an alternative method for the data flow and its monitoring, including that the system is aware of the user. The proposed system proved to be efficient and fulfilled the requirements.",

Lung cancer is the most common malignant disease worldwide. Late diagnosis, with the disease at an advanced stage, decreases the patient's life expectancy. The present work deals with the use of spatial analysis tools to present the spatialization of the incidence of lung cancer, in the microregions assisted by the Hospital do Câncer de Muriaé (HCM), and to map the different staging groups. Therefore, the medical records of patients treated at the HCM, from 2019 to 2020, with a clinical diagnosis of lung cancer, were analyzed. For this, the ETL process (Extract, Transform and Load) presented itself as an important tool in loading the data to the database, and in the step to identify the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on neighborhood information, city and state, contained in the database. Through georeferencing and analysis tools and spatial mapping, it was possible to generate thematic maps showing different relationships between geographic and epidemiological factors of the disease, being an important instrument to support prevention and epidemiological control actions.",

Nevertheless, FPGAs can be vulnerable to security threats such as reverse engineering, cloning, and overbuilding attacks. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been introduced as leading, robust, low-cost solutions against different hardware security threats. PUFs are hardware security primitives which operate as a one-way function that produces a unique output from the same input and the same PUF circuit implemented on different boards. As a result, PUFs output can be used as a “digital fingerprint” to identify electronic devices/systems uniquely, and it can be used in different security scenarios. This study presents the optimization of one of the most PUF types implemented in hardware security applications, called ring oscillator PUF or ROPUF. The presented ring oscillator PUF shows outstanding performance in terms of uniqueness and bit-aliasing with less hardware compared to the related work.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is a software tool that allows information present in databases to be converted into intelligent decisions based on data and not on experience or feelings. This work presents a review of the algorithms used in the classification of student performance present in the database of the national technical university, specifically in the software engineering career. Information classification analysis using ma- chine learning algorithm has become a modern and powerful instrument, which could help academic institutions improve retention and performance rate of courses by students and with this obtain a more general view of student performance before starting the course based on information from other courses and general student variables in order to reduce the risk of failure. The main objective of this work is to describe the variables used by the National Technical University and the application of different automated learning algorithms in order to obtain the metrics that allow demonstrating the best algorithm among those studied. Finally, the article concludes with a classification algorithm that provides an accuracy of around 80% to 82% that can be replicated in other university institutions.",

In recent years, there has been a great need to connect new IoT devices to precision agriculture. Known as connected objects, it has been gaining more and more strength. As well as the adoption of IoT for agriculture, homes, smart cities, logistics, healthcare, manufacturing and others. There are also numerous concerns regarding the communication of these devices. With the ability to collect data, IoT technology becomes a valuable resource and care must be taken in the search for effective communication mechanisms. In this sense, this work aims to present an analysis between the MQTT-SN and LWM2M communication protocols, comparing their performance in the transmission of messages. The model was developed with the help of the Node-RED tool, which consists of flow-based programming in the evaluation and performance implemented at runtime. At the end of the simulations, it was possible to evaluate that the MQTTSN protocol presented better results in the tests performed.",

    "abstract": "Este artigo tem como objetivo analisar a fadiga como fator humano contribuinte para acidentes aeronáuticos no âmbito do Controle de Tráfego Aéreo da Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB). Para que esse estudo fosse possível, recorreu-se a metodologia por meio de uma pesquisa exploratória, de natureza aplicada, com abordagem qualitativa, utilizando como técnica de coleta de dados as seguintes fontes: análise documental do Comando da Aeronáutica, legislações nacionais e internacionais, entrevista semiestruturada com especialistas da área e a observação do pesquisador. Como resultados encontrados foi possível identificar a fadiga como principal fator de risco humano dos controladores de tráfego aéreo. Por esta razão, aplicou-se a FTA (Árvore de Análise de Falhas) como ferramenta de identificação de riscos na execução do processo. A ferramenta mostrou que embora 66,39% dos acidentes são decorrentes de fatores de risco operacional, relacionados aos pilotos que, por vezes, possuem pouca experiência e, ainda, as falhas relacionadas ao processo decisório, que corrobora com 32,95% dos acidentes relacionados aos fatores de risco humano. Além disso, propõe-se a implementação do software FAST (Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool) adaptado, a fim de mensurar o desempenho operacional do Controlador de Tráfego Aéreo por meio do monitoramento do sono, visando evitar o estado de fadiga. Por fim, sugere-se a utilização de Indicadores de Desempenho da Fadiga de modo a fornecer um mecanismo para melhoria contínua da segurança operacional, visando prevenir a ocorrência de acidentes avaliados na FTA.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the planet faces a scenario in which the overexploitation of finite resources has seriously compromised their availability for the development of activities subject to their use in the long term. According to the perspective of several authors, through the circular economy it will be possible to preserve the value of materials and products for as long as possible, avoiding sending as much waste as possible back to nature and getting it to be reintegrated. to the production system for reuse [11]. The objective of this research was to analyze the activities related to the circular economy in Latin America, through the use of panel data econometric techniques. The results showed that the best model that fits is the one with fixed effects and that the main problems that affect the environment have to do with the growing demand for natural resources and with the planet's capacity to assimilate the waste it generates. Therefore, it is essential to forge productive cooperative relationships and transformative alliances within the region and encourage governments to play a fundamental role as sources of financing for new initiatives in infrastructure, education and R&D, which are important to promote the transition towards the circular economy and link it with the development of Industry 4.0 technologies.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a strong tendency for the development of new Internet applications, many of which based on the overlay networks paradigm and oriented towards the goal of content sharing. However, as a consequence of this effective growth of overlay networks, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) infrastructures are overloaded with many Peer-to-Peer (P2P) related traffic, inducing more difficulties in the perspective of several ISP management and traffic engineering tasks. This work promotes the development of an overlay network based system allowing generic content sharing functionalities among the users, but with the ability to be controlled by the ISP. In the proposed system, the ISP is able to take advantage of specific P2P traffic control mechanisms, with the devised overlay architecture also supporting collaborative mechanisms with the ISP. Within this purpose, two basic contents transfer modes are supported by the system (client-server or P2P based ones). The devised overlay system also integrates two distinct application level routing strategies and several Traffic Engineering mechanisms that can be activated by the ISP. In particular, it is possible for the ISP to protect specific links and routers of the infrastructure from the overlay generated traffic. In a distinct perspective, it is also possible to prioritise specific links or routers of the network in order to be traversed by larger volumes of the overlay traffic. Such decisions can be permanently assumed, or activated by the ISP only during specific time periods. Additionally, the overall amount of P2P related traffic circulating in the overlay network can be also easily controlled by the ISP. A real prototype of the proposed collaborative system was implemented and tested in the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE).",

    "abstract": "The objective of the research carried out is to determine the behavior of the university students of the city of Sucre in the face of the intention to undertake within a businessincubator, for this purpose it has been worked under the modelof the Theory of Planned Behavior of Ajzen, which has allowedto determine which are the main factors that influence the timeof undertaking within a business incubator, analyzing the four constructs of the model such as: entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial intention. Using the PLS-SEM program, the following results were obtained; the intention to start a businessthrough an incubator is 76%; the subjective norms explain the entrepreneurial attitude in 66% and the perceived behavior control in 62%, with a correlation from acceptable to optimal, however, the entrepreneurial attitude towards entrepreneurial intention presents one of the lowest ratios of 0.26. Based on the results obtained in the IPMA matrix, it is suggested to considerthat the environment is very important for students with regardto entrepreneurship, so they could use the services of a businessincubator, this implies the importance of restructuring the attitude entrepreneurial, since it was validated that it is a construct that is not directly related to the entrepreneurialintention. The findings reached contribute to the knowledge about entrepreneurship and serve as support to establish policies and action strategies aimed at the execution of a business incubator within the University.",

This article presents an innovative proposal for a prototype of an advanced traffic routing system, based on SDN technology. This prototype offers several mechanisms to deal with traffic routing, including the calculation of shortest paths and immediate injection of routes, the ability of immediate convergence after link failures, protection of ISP infrastructure links or routers, reaction to different load levels on the network, the ability to forward individual traffic flows by specific routes and the multiplexing of the topology by different virtual networks. Thus, the developed prototype presents a traffic routing solution that adapts and responds effectively to current and emerging challenges posed by a vast field of applications inherent to actual information systems and technologies.",

Firstly, data were extracted from official sources of public entities in the city of Recife about dengue cases in the year 2020. After this extraction, Python commands were applied to understand how the dengue outbreak in Recife happened in that specific year. It was possible to conclude that dengue is not one of the reasons for death and doesn´t cause hospitalization for patients. It was also possible to draw heat maps showing the neighborhoods that had the biggest outbreaks in 2020 (highlighting the Ibura and Cohab neighborhoods). In the second stage of this work, Machine Learning (using Linear Regression) was applied to analyze the time series of dengue in Recife between the years 2013 to 2020: a history was projected over these 7 years and a decreasing trend line of outbreaks was verified. dengue fever in Recife for the next few years.",

The high costs of this equipment mean that hospitals in developing countries have a limited supply of such equipment. Therefore, this paper presents the redesign, simulation, fabrication, and evaluation of a CPAP device that was developed in Europe but has now been replicated in Latin America. It starts with the analysis of the device’s original design and through exploratory techniques and computer simulation the materials, parts, and assembly are determined. Functional tests validate that a prototype similar to the original was obtained that will provide noninvasive positive air pressure that keeps patients' airways open.",

The general research questions addressed the objective of the study: What are the conceptual and methodological changes evidenced in the students with respect to STEM work after completing the workshop as seen from the teachers' perspective? And What attitudes do teachers observe in students after the development of the CISOGRA workshop and the approach to teacher practice? The research technique was a semi-structured interview using a script that includes a series of questions that have been used in a flexible way. A content analysis was carried out, using a system of categories constructed in a deductive and inductive way. In relation to the results of the variables of the coded documents, we found that the frequencies and their respective % correspond to a total of 184 catalogued segments, being the category of \"Valuation of the project as a didactic proposal\" the one that marks a predominance with 78 segments, followed by the category of \"Impact of the project towards the attitude of science and mathematics\" with 56 coded fragments. In this way and as the teachers interviewed commented, this does not remain only in robotics classes, but the children take it to the classroom, their daily life, being able to internalize working with other people because they know the importance of teamwork and the multiple solutions to a problem.",

Therefore, this document describes the procedure for shaping the tip of a hypodermic tube. This includes the design, manufacture, and adaptation of this essential internal element of a UCL VENTURA CPAP ventilator. SolidWorks software is used for the design, while ANSYS software is used for the simulation. An analysis of the machine's infrastructure is performed to determine that there is no overstress and unexpected failures are generated. Likewise, an impact analysis is performed in a specific contact region, between the tip and the tube, to determine its deformation. Finally, the machine is built and laboratory tests are performed. The results show 1.31 mm (average value) of deformation of the hypodermic tube, which adapts to the developed simulations, corroborating the correct operation of the mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a quantitative analysis method is proposed to calculate the risks from cyber-attacks focused on the domain of data security in the financial sector. Cybersecurity risks have increased in organizations due to the process of digital transformation they are going through, reflecting in a notorious way in the financial sector, where a considerable percentage of the attacks carried out on the various industries are concentrated. In this sense, risk assessment becomes a critical point for their proper management and, in particular, for organizations to have a risk analysis method that allows them to make cost-effective decisions. The proposed method integrates a layered architecture, a list of attacks to be prioritized, and a loss taxonomy to streamline risk analysis over the data security domain including: encryption, masking, deletion, and resiliency. The layered architecture considers: presentation layer, business logic layer, and data management layer. The method was validated and tested by 6 financial companies in Lima, Peru. The preliminary results identified the applicability of the proposed method collected through surveys of experts from the 6 entities surveyed, obtaining 85.7% who consider that the proposed three-layer architecture contains the assets considered critical.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a data security model of a big data analytical environment in the financial sector. Big Data can be seen as a trend in the advancement of technology that has opened the door to a new approach to understanding and decision making that is used to describe the vast amount of data (structured, unstructured and semi-structured) that is too time consuming and costly to load a relational database for analysis. The increase in cybercriminal attacks on an organization’s assets results in organizations beginning to invest in and care more about their cybersecurity points and controls. The management of business-critical data is an important point for which robust cybersecurity controls should be considered. The proposed model is applied in a datalake and allows the identification of security gaps on an analytical repository, a cybersecurity risk analysis, design of security components and an assessment of inherent risks on high criticality data in a repository of a regulated financial institution. The proposal was validated in financial entities in Lima, Peru. Proofs of concept of the model were carried out to measure the level of maturity focused on: leadership and commitment, risk management, protection control, event detection and risk management. Preliminary results allowed placing the entities in level 3 of the model, knowing their greatest weaknesses, strengths and how these can affect the fulfillment of business objectives.",

Thus, advertisements on digital platforms during the COVID-19 crisis came to modify their essence and structure, telling stories that involved the subject more and making him the protagonist of the message. Some authors have catalogued this restructuring of the advertising discourse during the crisis as Advertcrisis: a creative line that uses the crisis itself to elaborate messages that promote products and services. There are several categories that have used this formula -such as the banking category-, which used the crisis as a creative line to develop its discourse. For this reason, many messages focused on highlighting concepts such as union, progress or improvement. The objective of this study was to analyze, through in-depth interviews, the perception of men and women about the digital messages that some brands of the banking category developed during the first months of the pandemic. It has been observed how the participants of this research have had a negative perception of these many of the virtual strategies, since these have only been limited to emit empty emotional messages, unrelated to the real problems they were going through.",

The intention to continue using this type of learning will be determined by perceived social ability, willingness to learn and perceived usefulness. The online survey was adopted in the research with the Google forms tool, for which a structured questionnaire was designed. and it was applied to 260 registered and active students in the subject of Information and Communication Technologies of the USFX Business Administration Career. The data processing with multiple regression was specified, and the analysis was carried out with the model of structural equations (PLS-SEM) that allowed the verification of the proposed hypotheses. The results showed that the students under study agree to continue using online learning as they agree that it will be useful in their current and future learning process, improving their social interaction skills with their teachers and peers in turn. Continuing with the use of virtual education empowers them to achieve greater productivity and achieve their academic goals without restriction of time and space and helped by the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the regular quality of Internet access and the use of cell phones by some students for online education limit the reception and use of virtual training.",

The present paper shows the development of a low-cost DT used for monitoring the state of the process and the product development using augmented reality (AR) and free software for its configuration and programming. The design was tested in the MPS 500 classification station, which is a modular production station that has industrial sensors and actuators and was controlled with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) board responsible for sending data to the Firebase cloud to further show the DT in real-time in a mobile phone. Results show that with the help of the DT and AR, it is possible to automate industrial processes and monitor them from different places, collecting and analyzing data to achieve the implementation of solutions based on the data generated by the DT, enabling a greater level of digitalization and information to increase the efficiency and reliability of the processes.",

For this, population vaccination data against Covid-19 and data on severe cases were arranged in time series for correlation study. The results show that the adherence in residents to the vaccination against Covid-19 can directly reflect a reduction of serious cases, even in front of challenges such as the relaxation of restrictive measures, the pandemic politicization, the high contagion of the variants, and the spread of misinformation about vaccines. The research also demonstrates that establishing a technological policy to combat pandemics may make a difference by generating consistent and reliable data for science in the race for answers, bringing speed and organization in the population immunization.",

    "abstract": "There are scenarios where it can be useful or necessary to directly transform and instrument compiled code, rather than resorting to source code changes with subsequent compilation. These transformations can be motivated by several reasons, such as: immediate repair of problems encountered in production, neutralization of potentially malicious code, performance improvements, instrumentation for profiling and inspection purposes, fault injection, or unavailability of source code. While tools are available for conducting this kind of transformations for many different software ecosystems and languages, there is a limited set of options for doing so for WebAssembly applications. In this paper, we present a novel tool and language, the WasmManipulator/WmrLang, for manipulating WebAssembly code, which allows you to perform code transformations, using an aspect-oriented approach for specifying code locations, and code insertion, replacement, or deletion to be executed at those locations. In addition, because WebAssembly routines can be heavily interdependent on the JavaScript code that uses them, the tool has certain features that allow you to take advantage of and exploit this dependency. This includes defining additional types in WASM code, and interpreting/executing expressions at runtime.",

However, when administrative staff schedule an exam, at the Cova da Beira University Hospital Center, in the Department of Children's and Women's Health, Gynecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics, not always information flows to medical staff in an efficient mode. Radiology Information System (RIS), systems that support this information flows, some-times are unavailable or too expensive. As a first approach, research at the public contracts database portal was conducted, but few references were found, and none referred to the use of open-source technologies. To fill up this gap, a systematic review from a technical perspective has been con-ducted, based on the PRISMA guidelines, under the topics associated with \"RIS\", \"DICOM\", \"HL7\", \"OPEN SOURCE\" and \"RADIOLOGY\", in the databases PubMed Central, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital. After applying several exclusion criteria, fourteen articles were included for careful con-sideration. These studies address some consistent positive evidence on the efficacy of using open-source technologies associated with DICOM and HL7 protocols to support a RIS implementation.",

Traditional botnet detection methods, usually signature-based, are unable to detect unknown botnets. The behavior-based analysis is promising for detecting current botnet trends, which are constantly evolving. This article proposes an exploration analysis of botnet detection mechanisms based on the network flow behavior. The main technique used to detect botnets was recently developed and is called Energy-based Flow Classifier (EFC). This technique uses inverse statistics to detect anomalies. Two heterogeneous datasets, CTU-13 and ISOT HTTP were used to evaluate the efficiency of the generated model and the results were compared with several traditional classifiers, of one and two classes. The results obtained show that EFC obtained more stable results, regardless of the domain, unlike the other tested algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Recently we have seen an increase in the frequency of radon concentration measurement campaigns, largely driven by directives adopted at a European level, and by increased public awareness of the problem. Many of the conducted assessments are simple concentration averages over a time range, where passive sensors are mostly used. Other assessments use portable devices that measure radon in a continuous mode, which can later be downloaded for analysis. However, other types of systems emerged, which continuously measure indoor radon concentrations, and using wireless communications make these data available in real time. This is the case of the RnMonitor platform, designed for online indoor radon monitoring in public buildings in northern Portugal using IoT devices with LoRa communication. The project provides a time series database to collect raw data and a multidimensional data warehouse to store a large amount of these data in the long term, and to make possible the use of OLAP analytical query tools to explore the data in a multidimensional way. Thus, this article describes the development and implementation of a Data Analytical Processing Module of the RnMonitor platform. This module is composed by an ETL process, a multidimensional database and an OLAP server.",

    "abstract": "To transform an organization, it isn’t possible to ignore the people aspect and the significant impact of talent development in any transformation process. While in larger organizations, there is often access to more resources that ultimately could bring the needed competencies to successfully run such a complex program, in small or medium enterprises, the resources are more limited and the access to talent more difficult, forcing a potential more aggressive strategy in developing the digital skills needed to enable their transformation. This work aims to review some of the literature and better comprehend the role of learning analytics as a practice that could potentially be used to enhance the learning process within Small and Medium Enterprises and support the improvement of digital literacy within these companies.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of functional capacity in old age is associated with a more active and dignified life. Maintaining this capacity is not a trivial task; several diseases can make it difficult to practice regular physical exercises or make it unfeasible, such as knee osteoarthritis. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a treatment for muscle rehabilitation positioned as an alternative. However, it is still unclear which electrostimulation configurations can produce the most effective treatment. The literature indicates that the difference in treatment depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the patients. In this scenario, a decision support system is designed to assist physiotherapists in data analyses to create a personalized treatment. The proposed treatment relies on a wearable system with an NMES actuator and biofeedback sensors. Thus, it is expected to adapt the NMES in real-time based on unique patient characteristics, such as muscle fatigue. In addition, the system architecture is designed for the treatment session to be carried out at the patient’s home, reducing costs and providing more comfort.",

    "abstract": "Automation plays a key role during software testing activities since it reduces the cost and the risk of human error during execution. Random testing is one aspect of automation, which consists in performing a series of random events in a given application by setting only input parameters and execution modes. One of the most used tools for random testing in Android applications is the Monkey provided by Google. This tool executes random tests from input parameters that represent the domain of interactions allowed by the Android operating system. However, its configuration depends on the tester’s experience and a few tools exist supporting the Monkey’s usage. In this sense, we present the X-Monkey library that makes running the Monkey easier on all application’s screens and may support the configuration of Monkey’s parameters according to the UI elements present on the screens. Two experiments were conducted with Android applications to assess this library. The results indicated that the X-Monkey did not increase the number of crashes found, but it helped to identify which screens have crashes. Furthermore, the results also show that it is possible to achieve higher code coverage using the X-Monkey library.",

Such vehicles share a large amount of information using different technologies. To make data available closer to vehicles and thus streamline communication, edge services are becoming a support for intelligent transport systems. However, this service has limited computational resources. Thus, optimizing the use of these resources is a challenge. In this way, this work propose a metaheuristic mechanism based on the whale optimization algorithm to perform the decision-making process for resource allocation in an edge computing environment, named MARTIAL. Results show that our approach performed better when compared to other traditional algorithms.

Graphical contents are usually more effective than just the written text in web readability because people hardly have time to sit down and read anything lengthy anymore. However, irrelevant or bad-quality graphical content on the web contributes to poor readability, distracting the reader from the focus of the reading. The main aim of this research is to make images on the Web more readable to people. For this, we will analyze the factors that affect the readability of graphical contents on the web, propose a new measure to automatically calculate the relevance of the graphical contents, and finally design the guidelines to improve the readability of graphical contents on the web. User studies will be performed and the findings will be used to devise guidelines that web designers can use to improve the readability of their web pages.",

Universities adapt their management processes, not only in education, but also in applying new communication channels in the provision of services to students, who seek to streamline the relationship with their institution, optimizing resources and response times. It is the responsibility of the directors of HEIs, through their strategies, to move towards a digital culture in which the entire educational community can interact, leaving aside traditional structures applied in management towards students and the general public. The digital transformation in educational organizations is possible and necessary to begin as soon as possible and it will be viable if the teams that have to implement it know in detail the vision and strategy of the university, they know clearly where they want to go and what they want attain [1]. The main objective of this research is to determine the process of digital transformation in which the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL) is working, the changes obtained as a result of the adaptation of new attention and communication channels in the provision of academic-administrative services, mainly towards his students. The processed data correspond to the collection of information on the use of communication channels used by UTPL students and how the issue of the COVID 19 pandemic influenced the repowering of these relationship media, ratifying the student as the center of its operation.",

    "abstract": "In operations in an interagency environment with the participation of the civil and military institutions, there is a need for centralized coordination and, above all, for the sharing of information between the entities involved in order to achieve the common objective of the operation. The lack of standardization, the lack of a business model that allows the exchange of content and the high cost involved are barriers that hamper interoperability between agencies that participate in interagency operations. This work intends to tackle the aforementioned obstacles by proposing a business model, based on an architecture composed of an API Gateway and a monetization module, with the main objective of providing the necessary interoperability for the monetized sharing of information between the entities involved in interagency operations with the participation of the civil and military institutions. It is also intended to enable data sharing to be carried out transparently to those involved and to be a tool to encourage integration, attacking the obstacle of high cost, with the implementation of monetization whenever information sharing occurs. To achieve the objectives, the proposed model will have as a central element of its architecture a Gateway that will orchestrate the implemented APIs and, among others, the Contractual Control, Billing and Financial Control and Integration modules. To validate the proposed model, a prototype was implemented and tests were carried out to exchange information between organizations.",

When considering that Brazil has more than 210 million people, it is noted that the SUS, with a annual budget (2022) of US$ 31B is the largest public and free health system in the world. To manage all care provided by SUS in health centers and posts, hospitals, laboratories, and blood centers, including; and the Health Surveillance, Epidemiological Surveillance, Environmental Surveillance services, in addition to foundations and academic and scientific research institutes, the Ministry of Health (MS) makes use of more than 300 technological platforms. However, despite the existence of all these systems, there is still no characterization of this platforms from the perspective of computational architecture of Health Information Systems (HIS). Thus, this article presents the main aspects of the SIS and the computational characteristics of the ICT systems which support the management of Primary Health Care in the SUS.",

This paper investigates the added value of combining traditional rating factors with driving behaviour data obtained using telematics to improve automobile insurance risk management. Two classification techniques are used for investigating the claim frequency: (i) a classical Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson distribution for the expected number of claims, and (ii) a Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) GLM machine-learning technique. The empirical results suggest that the vehicle distance driven influences the probability of having a road accident and, thus, the cost of auto insurance coverage. This means that the use of telemetric data has the potential to improve risk management in insurance, facilitate price discrimination and reduce unintended cross-subsidies between policyholders.",

Therefore, this research seeks to analyze the relationship between human capital measured by the number of researchers dedicated to academic research and development as a dependent variable, public spending on education and R&D spending as explanatory variables for 8 South American countries. Through a random effects panel model, the existence of a statistically significant and positive relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable is shown, using logarithms for the difference of units between the variables. As a policy recommendation, we highlight the importance of public spending on education and R&D to increase human capital, in this case the number of researchers per country.",

In this work, with the objective ofevaluating the performance of tree-based survival analysis models for this purpose, PD was examined from different methodological approaches, more particularly, exploring different machine learning algorithms for this type of approach. A credit card refinancing dataset was used, and results from twotree-based survival analysis tools, Survival Tree and Random Survival Forest, were compared against the usual algorithm based on Cox Proportional Hazards Regression and classification models. The results show that Survival Analysis techniques with tree-based models are good alternatives to traditional survival analysis methods used for PD modeling.",

However, pedagogical strategies are required to implement technologies and achieve meaningful learning. Serious games arise as a proposal that seeks the development of learning through the development of activities of the game adjusting to the main way in which it is learned: through what is said and done. In this context, the objective of the research is to establish the use of serious games aimed at reinforcing literacy skills that strengthen the learning of second-year students of EGB. The focus of the research is qualitative with a descriptive scope, in which interviews were conducted with the actors of the educational process. The results show that children fail to develop their literacy skills, due to scarce didactic resources, ignorance of methodologies, lack of practice exercises and poor integration of innovative strategies that stimulate collaborative learning in the learning environment. The development of a strategy based on serious games, from mobile applications for the strengthening of literacy skills, with positive reinforcement and constant feedback, will allow students to maintain interest and develop these skills that are indispensable to continue in the educational process.",

The main objective of the study was to analyze the image that tourists create, through social networks, of the Douro as a tourist destination. Thus, two methodologies were applied - qualitative and quantitative. In a first approach, a qualitative analysis was made to social networks related to the Alto Douro Wine Region and, in a second phase, a questionnaire was applied to tourists who visited this region. The results showed that the image of the region under study is formed by three main dimensions: the Douro River, the Vineyards, and Porto wine. This information allows the main players operating in this region to promote the region, considering the experiences created and lived in these three dimensions.",

For gesture detection, a dataset is obtained using capture sensors such as Leap Motion and Myo armband. The training process is managed by stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In this context, in the classification stage, we determine the machine learning algorithms studies through mathematical model investigations. These algorithms allow to determine the real-time processing of hand gesture types and transfer them to a KUKA youBot for control. An application programming interface with ROS (Robot Operating System) is used for the communication process between the sensors and the robot. Finally, a hand gesture control environment is created after obtaining the training data set for the control of the KUKA youBot to test the remote operation with machine learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "When talking about Cybersecurity, particularly in security incident response plan and processes it is very common and relevant to talk about the ability to detect malicious or suspicious activities and behavior as soon as possible, in other words, in this domain, in Cybersecurity everyone wants to reduce the Mean time to detect (MTTD) or Mean time to respond (MTTR) a potential security incident. The use of Cyber Threat Intelligence - CTI indicators can contribute to the reduction of the mean time to detect threats and consequently directly influence the time to response, however there are different types of Cyber Threat Intelligence that serve different purposes. The objective of the study is the development of a reference architecture to support and process data from the most diverse type of data sources in terms of Cyber Threat Intelligence, for example using the combination data from Open Source Intelligence - OSINT sources and honeypots, taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of each of these types of data sources to correlate them with each other in order to increase the trust and reliability of the relevant indicators that can be used by security analysts in incident response processes. This paper presents the proposed work for a PhD thesis in Web Science and Technology, scheduled for completion in July 2023. This doctoral thesis falls within the area of Computer Engineering, with applicability in the domain of Cybersecurity and consequently in the subdomain of Threat Intelligence. The research project is in the state-of-the-art study phase. It is expected that the participation in this Doctoral Symposium will provide potential comments that can enhance the growth and complement the ongoing research work.",

Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of systems which are available to the public to help in this communication. In this paper we present a component to translate from Portuguese Natural Language to Portuguese Sign Language, using Machine Learning approach, which is a sub-component of a bigger system designed to allow communication between deaf and non-deaf via smartphones. Our approach uses a Neural Machine Translation system to provide translations between Portuguese Natural and Portuguese Sign Language Glosses to be used to animate a 3D avatar. Early testing of different machine learning architectures showed promising results of BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) evaluation on translations. The component uses a supervised learning model and results have shown that, under normal operating conditions an accuracy in the detection to translate from Portuguese-to-Portuguese sign language glosses, achieving above 80% on testing data using BLEU performance scores.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the location of existing national ports, the maritime transport sector and ports have great potential for the Portuguese economy. Despite this, several constraints are faced in the management of maritime traffic and navigation safety at the entrance to the port mouths. Although there are several applications to support navigation, there are few services that provide permanently updated information on the quotas of the funds. This lack of information is especially relevant as it can limit accessibility to port infrastructures. In this context, this article aims to present the process of design and development of a navigation support solution, which integrates real-time information on estimated bathymetry in harbor mouths. In this way, a type 1 research methodology was adopted, starting with the framing of the fundamental theoretical concepts for the investigation. Then, the conceptualization and design of the high-fidelity prototype was carried out and the respective evaluation with users of the target audience, which contributed to the implementation of the final solution. Finally, this investigation resulted in the development of the NAVSAFETY solution, which is believed to be very useful for users of the identified profiles, as it presents information on the state of the sea and weather, specific information, such as the bathymetric estimate, and provides information of scientific interest, such as the evolution of depth values at the port mouths.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that originates when melanocytes (the cells that give skin its tan or brown color) begin to grow out of control. Cells from almost any part of the body can develop into cancer and can then spread to other areas of the body. Currently there is no tool to assist the medical professional in the rapid diagnosis of melanoma. In this work, we propose a methodology that provides support to the dermatologist in the diagnosis of melanoma. This methodology is composed of 4 modules: Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Classification. Image preprocessing consists of hair removal. Segmentation consists of isolating the object of interest (the lesion). The extracted features for classification are: asymmetry, border, color and dermoscopic structures. Finally, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classification method is used to classify benign and malignant moles. The final results of the methodology show 91.67% accuracy, 92.50% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Since the results look promising, this technique could be the basis for more sophisticated tools useful to clinicians in the diagnosis of melanoma.",

Therefore, to prevent the continuous spread of these diseases, it is a need to accurately identify the degree of processing of different types of food. There are already several systems that provide rules to classify the level of processing. such as NOVA, but their limitations usually require that nutrition experts follow already established criteria to manually carry out the classification. In this work, we propose a methodology based on unsupervised learning to create food clusters that correspond to their level of processing. In this regard, we apply unsupervised machine learning algorithms to generate food clusters based on their nutritional properties. Training data were retrieved from the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). The application of the proposed methodology allowed the differentiation of foods according to their level of processing with an acceptable level of performance. In the end, the proposed methodology is applied to another dataset containing nutrition information from a very large list of real recipes in order to estimate the rate of ultraprocessed recipes.",

The implementation and use of learning management systems (LMS) in organizations have grown exponentially in recent years and have strongly impacted education, especially in higher education. The present systematic review aims to identify studies and research topics that are being addressed to improve the learning process in the e-Learning context in higher education institutions and map the studies on the implementation and use of LMS. The review process examined 30 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria on the topic over the past five years, adopting Kitchenham's systematic review design methodology. The results showed that technology alone would not be enough for e-Learning to become a dominant teaching standard. The digital literacy of the stakeholders is crucial in this process.",

However, if these images present poor quality such as noise, low contrast or poor details, they may not be useful for diagnosis, especially in automated image analysis systems. In this paper, a scheme for noise reduction and contrast enhancement of fundus images is presented. This approach is based on mathematical morphology operations and consists of two steps. In the first step, the Open-Close Close-Open (OCCO) morphological filter is used to smooth the image. In the second step, a contrast enhancement algorithm based on the top-hat transform is used. The proposed approach obtains better results in terms of noise reduction and contrast enhancement compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

For this purpose, data from the National Multipurpose Household Survey developed by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) in 2019 was used. The econometric strategy consisted of a logistic regression model. The results allow us to conclude that age, education levels, having adequate infrastructure and certain pro-environmental attitudes influence the probability of managing electrical and electronic waste generated by households. Our findings are a tool for the proposal of environmental policies that are based on strengthening education, so that households understand the methods of recovery and correct disposal of electronic waste. Regarding infrastructure, local governments should have specialized deposits that receive this type of waste and then channel it to certified companies.",

We used OvA method to transform our multi-labels problem into binary classification problem(s) and classify online news articles using different supervised machine learning algorithms.We use the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to measure performances of selected models. Most of the themes being recognized correctly with more than 80% of micro-average AUC. Overall, the Random Forest algorithm showed the best performance with 90% of micro-average AUC.Using the collection of data through various Senegalese online news portals, a tool to automatically categorize news published articles can be developed with our final prediction model and to guide future research in this area.",

In recent years, this has motivated the advancement of edge computing or fog computing, which provides analysis and processing capabilities closer to where the data is generated. Due to the large amount of information that will be exposed in Edge Computing, the need arises to study security in depth in the scenarios proposed by these new paradigms; For this reason, the present work shows the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in which, of the 50 studies analyzed, 24 security problems were identified, which are identified as attacks that mostly affect the user. IoT and are also the most frequent in Edge Computing, some of these are: DoS and DDoS attack, man-in-the-middle attack, phishing attack, replay attacks, collusion attack, physical manipulation attack, fake node injection and device cloning; In the same way, it was determined what: knowledge of the location, geographical distribution, decentralized architecture, mobility support, scalability and reduced energy consumption, are characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of security attacks.",

    "abstract": "The transformations that the Graduate Unit of the Faculty of Economic and Business Sciences of the University of San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca is assuming, among which the application of an e-learning system for the development of its graduate programs stands out. In this perspective, evaluating their quality constitutes a fundamental task, so the objective of this research was to establish the perception of satisfaction of the graduate users and the determinants of the success of the system and learning of the Graduate Facultative Unit. To achieve this objective, an investigation was carried out whose approach is of a quantitative type, using the method of the structural equation model with partial least squares (PLS SEM) and the application of the SMART PLS 3 software. An online questionnaire was applied to a sample, with a mean effect size for 8 predictors of 100 Bolivian students from the diploma, master's and doctorate programs in the area of business economics. The results obtained determine that the quality of the collaboration positively influences the use of the e-learning system of the Postgraduate Unit. On the other hand, the quality of the service and the interaction of the students with others determine the level of user satisfaction and this influences the level of use of e-learning, which determines the individual impacts of the users of the learning programs respective training. Therefore, the quality of the collaboration, the quality of the service and the interaction perceived by the students will be the success variables that will contribute to directly increase the use and the satisfaction perceived by the user and, therefore, the individual impact.",

    "abstract": "The proposed system is an innovative solution that allows the implementation of shooting techniques training spaces using virtual reality and artificial vision concepts. The scenarios are emulated using development software called Unity. Silhouettes are virtualized images of typical targets useful to improve familiarity with the environment, precision and dexterity required by a shooter. The evaluation and qualification of the accuracy of the shot has as its main element a camera similar to a webcam, and under a total darkness environment, it is capable of evaluating with high precision the place of the silhouette where the infrared laser beam hit. The laser is adapted to a firearm through mechanical and electronic components. The image is processed using color recognition, edge detection, center of mass, and point detection; information that allows discriminating the contour of the laser and its center, to then assign a numerical value to the shot made. This ability to evaluate homographic images is another important contribution of this research. The results obtained in this investigation, after having made more than 10,000 shots, show the validity and significant contribution of the proposed system. The metrics presented are the product of actual shooting training exercises with people with little experience in the field.",

Very large classes or even a distance between the student and the teacher are the reasons that make a difficult solution for the teacher. In this context, a tool that helps the teacher's perception of these problems is extremely important. The objective of this work is to propose a system that helps in the perception of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of students in relation to classes. At the same time, it's proposed a tool that obtains better results compared to others already created with similar purposes, especially the VITA tool, developed for analyzing feelings using an affective lexicon dictionary. Entitled VITA 2.0, the tool presented in this work applies sentiment analysis in opinions written by the student regarding the class.

This activity has, however, under-gone changes about the size of herds, as well as production methods. Currently, there is a massive implementation of technology at the service of agriculture, allowing the automatic acquisition of in-formation and the consequent processing of it, enabling faster and more assertive decision making. These developments are also a reality increasingly present in livestock where the technology al-ready developed allows not only help in management, but also to know the health status of animals. The Animark LESS system is characterized by a low-cost solution that allows monitoring the presence of animals in the herd, with good contributions to animal welfare. The proposed system was tested in a goat farm.",

The development of this project was based on the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology, user stories were built as a requirements specification procedure. The interview technique (semi-structured) was used to collect the system requirements and was applied to the administrator of the Sarumaky association. According to the functionalities, the roles of administrator, cashier and customer were defined. The coding process was mostly oriented to the PHP programming language, the Laravel framework was used in its version 8 in complement with the Tailwind CSS and Livewire tools. To manage the code, the Visual Studio Code text editor was used and the MySQL database, the Apache Web server and the language interpreters were considered. The developed system, with scalable tools and architectures, is based on invoicing through banking entities and specialized delivery companies in the country, allowing the administration an alternative for the dissemination and commercialization of artisanal products, in addition to favoring the taking of decisions based on up-to-date and timely information.

    "abstract": "Traffic Classification methods aim for the automation of processes of analysis and categorization of traffic flowing through a network according to its intrinsic nature and characteristics. In its first iterations, traffic classification took advantage of aspects such as port numbers and payload analysis for categorization, however, due to the fast-growing and changing nature of the Internet, such methods became ineffective. Thus, the necessity for newer and more effective forms of traffic classification persists. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have proven to be an effective tool for analyzing and categorizing traffic within the context of modern networks, however, a number of issues can still emerge when evaluating the effectiveness of such methods in a real-world context. Issues such as overall classification throughput of ML algorithms, classification accuracy and precision, the integrity and/or representativeness of the datasets used in the training phase are important aspects of accessing the effectiveness of ML as a traffic classification method. The present paper analyses and compares a comprehensive set of studies and surveys covering the subject of ML as a tool for traffic classification. Our approach compares the data characteristics used for evaluating the effectiveness of ML algorithms, namely traffic classification in the context of a live network, and discusses issues concerning the creation and usage of datasets to train the ML algorithms so that their future application in real-time traffic can be similar to the results obtained during offline testing.",

Collection management consists of the development of activities and strategies to achieve the collection of debts. A collection management, to be effective, must take into account contact, communication, the business environment, mainly with ICT. In order to offer a tool that allows maintaining the sustainability of the Bambito Irrigation Association, in this project a Web Information System was developed to streamline the collection process of said association. The system provides timely information for both the client and the administrative staff, by establishing communication channels between the parties to obtain periodic updates on the progress of the clients' water consumption data, for a sustained change in behavior, helping to combat keeping data up-to-date and being able to make better decisions. The proposed application is based on the approach of new technologies, which allows agile development.",

According to the validations carried out in the exploratory and confirmatory phases, the agreeableness/cordiality factor showed low levels of reliability and a lack of adequacy of its items with its factor, for which the decision was made to remove this latent variable from the structural model. The study was carried out with 112 people dedicated to the visual arts among students and professionals in Arequipa - Peru. The study was carried out in two phases, in the first one the reliability tests and factorial analysis of the instrument were carried out (exploratory phase), using the IBM-SPSS software. In the second phase, the confirmatory analysis was carried out, using the PLS-SEM methodology for this purpose, which is a multivariate method called, Modeling of Structural Equations with Partial Least Squares. The study would reveal that four of the five personality factors (except agreeableness/cordiality), would influence the latent variable creative thinking more than the idea of their reputation on social media in the artist’s part of this research.",

    "abstract": "The introduction and widespread adoption of cloud computing has opened the door to the possibility of designing and building large scale systems with tremendous raw computing capabilities for dealing with an ever-increasing volume of data. However, the infrastructure required to support these systems became too complex for manual efforts, so practices such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Development and Operations (DevOps) methodologies with programmatic orchestration and provisioning of cloud infrastructures became increasingly common. This led to the creation of the OASIS Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard, which has seen extensive research by academia but infrequent adoption by the industry, as, despite simplifying partly the management of infrastructures, lacks the capacity of encapsulating the desired behaviour of the system and its business-level end-goals. The system only changes its configuration through manual intervention, which is a major source of error, or through pre-defined policies that instruct actions when a specific trigger occurs. Int2IT is presented here as a proof-of-concept solution to this specific problem, as an \"intent-based\" infrastructure management platform that incorporates autonomic computing concepts in order to manage cloud deployments autonomously, using a TOSCA-based cloud application description. The proposed solution will be able to capture the user’s \"intents\", which describe the system’s end-goals, and translate them into a TOSCA-based cloud application. As a result, it can then be deployed to the cloud and autonomously managed, by utilizing a Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge (MAPE-K) autonomic deployment life-cycle capable of adapting to the outside environment, ensuring that the end-goals are met to the greatest extent possible.",

Considering its importance, in the present study we analyze this problem from a theoretical and empirical perspective. We reviewed related research and conducted a survey to gain insights into mobile app users' perception of information security. The theoretical analysis shows a poor knowledge of users about the security of the information they share and a growing concern about the misuse that can be given to it. The empirical results revealed high levels of insecurity in users about the use that mobile applications can give to their information, at a general level as well as intergenerationally. It is the younger population generations, although in low percentages, that tend to trust and allow mobile applications greater access to their information with respect to adult populations.",

The possible advantage of this technique is the success in pattern recognition through the wave-forms properties of Fourier analysis and due the power of synthesis that the Fourier Transform has. The FNO was very efficient to solve parametric partial differential equations like Navier-Stokes Equation. ResNet20 took 21 minutes and 51 seconds for training, while the FNO took 4:11:14 hours to complete a hundred of epochs. The convolution occurs in a competitive way in the FNO, being perfectly possible to be used in the image recognition processes, with accuracy, recall, precision and F-Score slightly better than ResNet20 and quite similar to other neural networks available in the literature. However, based on time consuming, the FNO is not indicated to image classification. It should be used for other purpose like solving partial derivative equations.",

People with poor diets are more prone to chronic diseases and, in the long term, this can lead to dead. This study proposes a model for the recommendation of nutritional plans using the decision tree technique considering the patient data, in complement with the BMI (Body Mass Index) and BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) to evaluate and recommend the best nutritional plan for the patient. The algorithm used in the model was trained with a dataset of meal plan data assigned by specialists which were obtained from the Peruvian food composition table, and the data from the diets that were assigned and collected from the nutrition area of the Hospital Marino Molina Sccipa in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results of the experiment with the proposed algorithm show an accuracy of 78.95% allowing to provide accurate recommendations from a considerable amount of historical data. In a matter of seconds, these results were obtained using Scikit learn library. Finally, the accuracy of the algorithm has been proven, generating the necessary knowledge so that it can be used to create appropriate nutritional plans for patients and to improve the process of creating plans for the nutritionist.",

When developing .Net Core Web APIs however that support is strangely absent. By using a desktop-oriented library and a set of BLE devices an API was developed to assess real time access to them and provide proof of concept that data gathering is possible. The processed data is then provided to other apps using the restful API methods, developed under the .Net Core framework. Said data can then be used to supply dashboards, data analysis tools, or other fitness and wellness related applications. The API developed ultimately provided proof that it was possible to communicate with Bluetooth devices using asynchronous communication in a web application while repurposing a desktop application-oriented library. Further developments can increase the number of compatible sensors of the developed API for it to be able to use a broader number of devices, support more profiles and services and thus increasing its initial range.",

The main objective was to investigate whether the Nintendo® Wii has characteristics that allow promoting and improving the inclusion and quality of life of the elderly. In methodological terms, an exploratory study was chosen, because the confinement constraints associated with the pandemic did not allow the participation of a larger group, in which the participant observation method was applied. Data collection was carried out at the Activities Center of a municipality in the district of Castelo Branco, with the participation of three users. After the activities carried out, it appears that video games contribute to the inclusion and quality of life of the elderly, due to the fact that a collaborative environment is felt among the participants, the relaxed and mutual environment and the smiles and laughter that were heard. The fact that they mastered a technological resource was also emphasized because it gave them a feeling of inclusion in a technological world to which, in most cases, they feel on the sidelines. In short, the use of the Nintendo® Wii made it possible to verify that it can promote and contribute to a healthier and more inclusive life for the elderly.",

Although large data centers adopt high-performance equipment, including networking equipment, end-users often use low-cost equipment. In this context, this paper evaluates the performance of routers at the edge network on the end-user side to investigate low-cost alternatives. This study shows that the OpenWrt Linux distribution, installed on a Raspberry Pi 4, presented an average RX value equal to 964 Mbps, while the Cisco 1905 presented an average RX value equal to 963 Mbps; already for the TX, the average values were 947 Mbps and 963 Mbps for the Raspberry Pi 4 and Cisco 1905 respectively. We conclude, therefore, that the performance results obtained are similar and that it is possible to guarantee performance and availability with financially viable equipment.",

For this purpose, a probabilistic logistic model with a polytomous dependent variable is estimated, where the explanatory variable is constructed according to the complexity and diversity of tasks performed in an occupation as defined by ISCO-08. The results found allow confirming the research hypothesis: ICT skills increase the probability of Ecuadorian workers to be in occupations with a high level of competencies. In addition, there are significant differences between groups (ethnicity and gender) based on ICT skills in the level of competencies performed by workers.

However, none of them implements a secure and traceable log of changes that can bring accountability to the management of such infrastructures. On the other hand, recent research and development in blockchain technologies has allowed for the creation of Distributed Ledgers that can provide secure, immutable and traceable ledgers. These technologies have the potential to solve the problem by dynamically registering the changes the infrastructure management tools apply to IT infrastructures. For that purpose, a Proof-of-Concept tool was developed that incorporates a Permissioned Distributed Ledger, based on Hyperledger Fabric, as a middle layer to infrastructure management tools such as Ansible and Terraform, to prove the suitability of these technologies to provide a secure and immutable resource inventory and log of changes that enables for traceability and accountability of all modifications to the IT infrastructure, while also providing user identity management and control.",

One of the main changes is the written agreements with all suppliers, which share personal data.More than 95% of the business world are Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and SMEs represent 99,9% of business in Portugal. However, SMEs have scarce resources, thus making it challenging for these organizations to comply with GDPR and, in particular, to solve the written agreements.The authors have worked with SMEs to comply with RGPD and have developed a methodology to fulfill the supplier's agreements.We will show the results obtained and discuss the main challenges SMEs face in such a large regulatory.",

In particular, in 2001 a new approach called agile appeared, which led to a radical change in the way of developing software, evolving and gaining wide acceptance to this day. There are different methodologies, standards and frameworks that allow the management of software development projects. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the world's leading association of companies and institutions related to project management. In 2017, it forms an alliance with the Agile Alliance to develop the Agile Practice Guide. The main objective of the study is to exhibit the AgilePM-S Methodology as a proposal capable of integrating a process model added to an agile approach based on Scrum and the common practices defined in the Agile Practical Guide for the agile management of academic software projects. that leads them to success. Highlighting the importance of achieving knowledge, skills, and competencies in project management for educational programs related to software engineering. As an added value, a line of investigation of studies is opened that integrates the application of international standards in academic training as a learning strategy for the achievement of quality education.",

Today's society is increasingly mediated by technology, which poses more demanding challenges to the elderly population that has low digital literacy. This is an age group that suffers from some inequalities, and access to digital technologies is still a reality that does not apply to the generality of this group. This article aims to analyze some concepts and relate them, aiming to understand the accessibility of the SNS 24 application to the target audience of the elderly, based on the analysis of data collected from a small sample of citizens aged 65 and over, through interviews carried out. to 5 elderly people, this being an exploratory study, which had the pandemic confinement as constraints. In this way, it was possible to verify that the SNS 24 application can be extremely important for the daily life of the elderly, allowing greater autonomy and empowerment, through the approximation to health services. However, for this application to be inclusive and suitable for all age groups, it is necessary to carry out some reformulations, taking into account the needs that were raised with this study, namely with regard to the registration and size of the letters/fonts of the application.",

During the course, students learn that the process of engineering investigation requires conducting experiments to validate theories or hypotheses about what makes the system work. Each experimental run is a test. It is through active experimentation, the controlled intervention of a process that modifies the inputs and characteristics of the process, that it is possible to learn the effect of a set of different factors on a response variable. Based on experimental data collected to model thermal comfort in hospital waiting rooms, this paper aims to contribute to the knowledge of this phenomenon through the selection of the most appropriate statistical techniques to analyze the data.

    "abstract": "The covid-19 pandemic triggered the widespread use of digital technologies in practically all countries not only because of the need for organizations, companies and institutions to continue to produce, but also as a way for individuals - beings of a social nature - to communicate and interact with each other during this whole troubled period. Higher education institutions were also no exception and were forced to implement online teaching across the country so that students would not be left without access to knowledge and, consequently, regress in learning. The University Tunas that constitute themselves as musical groups and are normally assigned to these institutions (of higher education) are also an example of organizations or associations that have had to adapt to new contingencies through the latest digital technologies. This study focuses precisely on this issue of the use of digital technologies by University Tunas. However, the specific case study is the \"RaussTuna - Tuna Mista de Bragança (TMB)\" of the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (Portugal). In general, we intend to understand how this group of young people use digital technologies within the scope of their activity as an associative group: What are the digital technologies adopted by the University Tunas? What restrictions do members of a Tuna have in the use of digital technologies? What suggestions can be implemented to improve the digital quality of Tuna's activities? The results point to the use of a wide range of digital technologies for different purposes, especially office tools, electronic presentation software, audio, video, management of conferences or events and social networks. Members assume that they have a set of restrictions regarding the use of technologies and because of this they need training in the area to improve their skills. Finally, Tuna members present a set of improvements both at the software and at the hardware level that eventually can be implemented to increase digital quality.",

The results show that there are no records of Media Literacy programs and that the population studied has had to be incorporated into the Information Society according to their needs. The processes of media literacy should be underpinned by the Internet and generated by the State and ONGs, to be used as instruments of inclusion in the possibility of improving the quality of life of older adults.

    "abstract": "Knowledge sharing is one of the most relevant stages of knowledge management and is a process in which people exchange tacit and explicit knowledge, which can lead to the creation of new knowledge and competitive advantages. A community of practice is a group that evolves or is created around a common interest in a specific area to disseminate knowledge related to that area. This study aims to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess knowledge sharing in communities of practice. An online questionnaire was developed and applied between December 2020 and February 2021. This was disseminated in a community of practice on bioproducts (199 members) on Facebook and reshared on the social networks of the Faculty of Biotechnology – Universidade Católica Portuguesa as a stakeholder in this field. Questions were included for sociodemographic characterization, as well as assessing attitudes, intentions and knowledge sharing in relation to community of practice. For these, a 5-point Likert scale was used (1- strongly disagree; 5 - strongly agree). Internal consistency and construct validity were analyzed. Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.954) showed good internal consistency. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a good fit of the model (KMO = 0.707). The scree plot analysis reveals a one-factor solution, with the extracted factor explaining 52.9% of the total variance. This study demonstrates and certifies the capabilities of this questionnaire for the assessment of knowledge sharing in communities of practice.",

At the same time, it follows the risk-based resource allocation framework. A single indicator named HA (Human Allocation Factor). It is a universal indicator and can be used by the entire academic community or by professionals in decision-making processes for the allocation of people in any process. The study suggests it is possible to optimize the risk of attendance rates, legal and labor turnover, using a simple numerical indicator (HA). HA is an optimization measure, if the original value is used. In this case, it must be at least equal to or greater than 0.5. The output of the actual process was 0.41. The reverse of this measure, that is, 0.59 represents the measure of risk in current processes. It needs to be below 0.5. This means that the current process was at high risk and with low optimization. The first process that needed to be optimized was the Patrimony team. Then, the processes involving the Residual and Skilled Labor Service. The managers validated these results and acted in the processes indicated by the HA measure, being successful with that.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) and those protocol CoAP and MQTT has security issues that have entirely changed the security strategy should be utilized and behaved for devices restriction. Several challenges have been observed in multiple domains of security, but Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) have actually dangerous in IoT that have RT. Thus, the IoT paradigm and those protocols CoAP and MQTT have been investigated to seek whether network services could be efficiently delivered for resources usage, managed, and disseminated to the devices. Internet of Things is justifiably joined with the best practices augmentation to make this task enriched. However, factors behaviors related to traditional networks have not been effectively mitigated until now. In this paper, we present and deep, qualitative, and comprehensive systematic mapping to find the answers to the following research questions, such as, (i) What is the state-of-the-art in IoT security, (ii) How to solve the restriction devices challenges via infrastructure involvement, (iii) What type of technical/protocol/ paradigm needs to be studied, and (iv) Security profile should be taken care of, (v) As the proposals are being evaluated: A. If in simulated/virtualized/emulated environment or; B. On real devices, in which case which devices. After doing a comparative study with other papers dictate that our work presents a timely contribution in terms of novel knowledge toward an understanding of formulating IoT security challenges under the IoT restriction devices take care.",

The investigation was carried out in a state of social isolation due to the presence of Covid-19. The sample for the study consisted of 108 students from the 3rd to the 5th year of studies at the secondary education level of a public educational institution in the Arequipa region in Peru. The methodology that was used had two well-defined phases, firstly, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was carried out, this analysis had the objective of condensing the information in original variables to smaller series, secondly, an Analysis Confirmatory Factorial (AFC), through the modelling of structural equations based on variances, called PLS-SEM. It is concluded that the proposed structural model, which uses school achievement as a mediation variable, is explained from its variance in 81.6%, and the factorial load it exerts on the dependent variable such as school satisfaction is significant and decisive.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a model of security capabilities to prevent personal health data leakage in Big Data environments. There are new threats and risks in every organization in the health sector, among which the leakage of personal data stands out as the amount of digital information about a patient or employee circulates in networks, equipment, and systems. The proposed model allows the healthcare entity to measure the level of maturity of its organization by identifying how robust it is to prevent data leakage scenarios, as well as to identify existing gaps and shortcomings. This proposal allows healthcare organizations to establish remediation measures in those domains with a deficient level, acting preventively before the risk event materializes. The model incorporates 10 domains with the best practices of NIST, which have allowed an analysis to be carried out to obtain a greater scope of all the necessary edges to have an adequate level of prevention in the organization. The structure of the model is made up of three phases: 1. Diagnosis of the organization by using the proposed model through a questionnaire; 2. Collection and processing of the results divided into 3 sub-phases: 2.1 Review and measurement of the results of the answers, 2.2 Analysis based on criteria from 1 to 5, and 2.3 Level of maturity obtained; 3. The proposal was validated in private health organizations in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results show a trend of security deficiencies in the same domains for the companies evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Currently, energy consumption is one of the most important research areas in the world. The growing need to increase energy efficiency and improve the use of energy sources brings the need for better energy management and forecasting models. Therefore, forecasting energy consumption has become crucial for estimating energy consumption, as it provides both environmental and especially economic benefits. Forecasting is an integral part of business decision-making processes. The growing needs for greater energy efficiency and better use of energy sources bring out the need for better energy management and forecasting models. This article seeks to find the most suitable energy consumption prediction model through a review of studies that have developed data-based building energy consumption prediction models, with a particular focus on the machine learning algorithms used for prediction and some performance measures used for evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The number of online reviews increase considerably on platforms and have a significant impact on purchase decisions. These reviews can represent both an opportunity and a threat for a company. It is therefore essential to detect among the huge quantity of reviews, those which are unreliable. A question then arises: how to detect deceptive reviews? In this paper, we were interested in the concept of review trustworthiness. To detect the reliability of reviews, we give our definition of the reliability and propose a machine learning approach based on different classifiers. We consider that the information related to the comment itself (sentiments, linguistic elements etc.), and that relating to the user (activity, experience, sociability etc.) play a role on reliability of the review. We propose to include in our method these two classes of information. We did a series of experiments on the Yelp open dataset. Furthermore, in these experiments we have compared the performances of our trust model with a second model based only on the review’s content (using TF-IDF vectorisation method). Our results show on the one hand that the information we used (comments+users) play a role in determining the reliability of the review, and on the other hand that we achieve better performances with our features (i.e. without using TF-IDF method).",

The health ecosystem includes several interested and interconnected parties with different needs, entailing a high degree of information exchange between the actors involved. However, this information is highly fragmented and distributed, making continuous access difficult. Health care requires a permanent flow of such information, where health systems interoperate to have a global view of the historical data of a patient. However, there are several problems that prevent this objective to be met, this work is focused on identifying such problems. In this sense, Blockchain technology has a great opportunity to support the health sector, since it has multiple qualities that make it ideal for supporting the interoperability of health management systems. This document shows some of the most critical and challenging issues facing the interoperability of health systems, such as: health standards and smart contracts. Challenges for the interoperability of healthcare systems using blockchain technology are also identified and a solution from a software engineering perspective is shown. By doing this, our research extends and complements existing blockchain research in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic changed how people live their lives. This change, in turn, heavily affected companies in the sense that they had to adapt to the new reality in many different ways. A process that had to suffer major changes was the recruitment one since a lot of the traditional ways to recruit employees were not suitable in this new reality, which led to the massification of e-recruiting. In this article, we investigate the ways that companies operating in Portugal adapted in order to compete in this new e-recruiting paradigm. To this end, we sent a survey to multiple companies, directed towards their recruiters and human resources managers, to collect data and feedback relating to this adaptation. We obtained 38 answers, from which we were able to find that it is very common for companies to offer the option of remote work, either full or partial, to their employees, even as the pandemic loses strength. Furthermore, we also found out that while the use of social media, like LinkedIn, for the task of e-recruiting is also becoming a lot more common, there are still reservations about some other e-recruitment processes related to Artificial Intelligence and serious games.",

Smaller organizations, and especially those in developing countries, are facing bigger challenges in this process due to limited resources and lack of digital skills. One of the keys of this transformation is the digitalization of information, where optical character recognition (OCR) plays an essential role. This research analyzes current OCR tools and systems for document digitalization in low-resources organizations and presents a semi-automatic document processing and text-recognition solution that addresses their needs. The study then presents an experimental design to assess the efficiency of the tool. The results support the adequacy of using these tools, compared to current manual digitalization processes.",

The serious game prototype, through the use of games and gamification concepts, will positively influence the learning process, which we believe will facilitate the teaching of audiovisual production in a practical way. It begins with a mapping of the main theories of Virtual Reality and gamified scenarios; the essential objective is the use of games in education. The student selects an avatar that introduces him/her to the virtual world of a television set, where he/she selects the work to be done, the game allows him/her to choose and advance through levels until achieving an audiovisual product with the correct elements and quality corresponding to a documentary or report as selected. Advancing through all the levels will give you badges. It is scalable because it allows projecting new levels of practice that the student will be able to experience. It is also capable of applying the technique to new learning topics in any area of knowledge, allowing the student to create a practical world of his profession. The application of the methodology has also allowed us to identify the skills and competencies that students have developed in the XXI century and that tools and methodologies such as those applied allow us to strengthen.",

Universities make efforts and implement tutoring and support programs to retain students, however, they do not achieve the expected results. This phenomenon is conditioned by a set of factors that must be known to be taken into account. This article presents the results of a bibliometric analysis using the SCOPUS database to determine aspects that influence student dropout in careers related to information and communications technologies (ICT). The results show that the factors that stand out in the studies are: age, gender, sense of belonging, academic performance, performance in previous studies, motivational, organizational factors, among others. Knowing these factors will allow us to determine their influence on student dropout.",

Many works use the Fog computing paradigm to address this problem, as it brings the cloud next to the vehicular nodes, but without considering its mobility.

To reverse the gender bias, teams must have gender diversity, and algorithms cannot be considered biased. To this research paper, we run a systematic literature review of articles, reports and websites, to understand the associated concepts of gender inequality, and how society is fighting gender inequality. An initial selection of keywords was made to be the core of this article. Subsequently, the selection of information sources that contained information within the scope of these concepts was carried out. Research shows that progress has been made in giving men and women equal opportunities in IT roles. Although data points to a very low percentage of women in digital when compared to men there are commitments made and incentives for it to \"be for women\" as well as for men in the future.",

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been employed to secure cloud and container environments. However, the inherent characteristics of these environments have presented new challenges to ensuring an adequate level of security. In this paper, a framework is proposed for implementing a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) by analyzing system calls with machine learning on a Kubernetes container orchestration cluster. The presented framework prevents the overhead of the cluster nodes from processing focused on intrusion detection through a distributed and scalable architecture. Alerts generated in the occurrence of detected anomalies can be used as a complementary source of information for decision making and action by the Security Operations Center (SOC) team to deal with an eventual security incident. The proposed architecture was implemented in the GNS3 software, emulating a corporate network environment to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the framework in a real environment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how talent is attracted to companies and organizations is relevant. Additionally, it is critical to understand what keeps talent in organizations, something that Human Resource Management professionals have regularly debated over the past two decades. People, especially the younger and better prepared, change jobs today in a much more dynamic way than in the past, forcing organizations to face global competition, through strategies to maintain the high satisfaction of their teams and anticipate the intention talent output. The technology sector is one of the most targeted: the turnover of people is higher than in most sectors. This article seeks to understand how data analysis can help Human Resources Managers to perform their work better, either by knowing their teams or using people analytics to predict the change in their teams. It is hoped that this work will be a contribution to HRM and technology professionals, two areas in which it is essential that they dialogue in order to promote a better and more effective functioning of teams, whatever the sector is.",

However, in Human Resources, even though Human Resource Management Systems (HRIS) is already rooted, the development of data analysis is slow to appear. This is due to the scepticism existing in the area's professionals regarding People Analytics and the ethical issue of reducing people to data. This work discusses what People Analytics is, what topics can be developed, how HRIS can be transformed and what the future this area will have within companies. This work intends to contribute in this topic discussion, since it is relevant on Human Resources Management jobs, but also on the technological functions, mainly on information systems implementation to data collection, and in data analytics, both to promote data-driven approaches and decisions.",

It is necessary to transform them into knowledge, using applications and techniques to gather, analyze and store them efficiently. It is then observed the importance of data quality, which is directly associated with the improvement of the people working in the process, so that the users' objective is the same as expected for strategic decisions. The objective of this literature review is to demonstrate that the training of those who have direct contact with the data, initially, is an indispensable factor for them to understand and exercise the role of mediators in the way data is collected, processed and destined. This is because this initial reception of data directly impacts the performance of business planning and shows the maturity level of this planning in a context of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics.",

With the fasten progress of digitalization and with data use and storage, companies can take major decisive steps to achieve market share through the advantages of information technology. Based on the literature review, as well as on the investigation of studies carried out empirically, it was possible to identify the advantages and barriers to digitization in supply chain management. The use of Business Intelligence systems in that process demonstrates positive and encouraging results within an area of growing interest. In a study conclusion, we obtained confirmation of a remarkable competitive advantage in companies that use BI integration and supply chain management, however, there is still a long way to go in systems updating and people involved in the processes rooted in the companies. The development process proved to be advantageous, as long as there is effective participation and motivation of the involved managers.",

In a slow and tedious \"fight\" for more than 30 years, the digital race, may represent a long journey in the eyes of its users. Before such mentality, the concern and exponential government interest in the last 10 years of demystifying this thought. Thus, there have been many implementations of innovative projects to improve services in the service of its users (TA data dictionary; BIORC Budget Business Intelligence (Directorate General for Budget), SIGNAL project, the Municipal Transparency Portal (DGAL) and of the Ministry of Health’s)). However, faced with a massification, redundancy, data processing, and a constant turnover in the heads and directors of the AP, can we really affirm a possible change in the \"old-fashioned\" technological paradigm? Can the \"established\" social mentality of the technological stagnation disappear? We experience that the AP has a more troubled and mountainous path compared to the common company. Its structure, the difficult change of mentalities, whether in the leadership or socially, makes the governmental objective difficult on a larger scale. It will be necessary to root out that the comparison is unequal. We must threat the same what is the same and different what is different.",

Taking advantage of the non-formal nature of social networks, an acculturation intervention was implemented, aiming to fade this distance, and promoting the interaction and collaboration of those involved in the process. Based on an initial interview with two Northeastern Brazilians who had recently arrived in Portugal, a set of didactic resources was created that constituted a quick guide divided into 3 modules: \"Vocabules and idioms\", \"Cost of life\" and \"Climate\". This guide was made available by phases over 6 days, through a Facebook group. The intervention also had a synchronous activity with the participation of 6 out of around 20 active participants, through a quiz created on Kahoo!. The analysis of the results makes it possible to state that the intervention achieved satisfactory results for most participants. It is also possible to conclude that the availability of resources aimed at a specific target audience promoted the motivation of the participants and their continuous interaction.",

The procedure is validated through metrics and qualitative and quantitative analysis with evaluation indicators on the appropriation or strengthening of emotional skills in children with ASD and the definition of the characteristics of the software developed with co-design techniques that involve the children themselves. The tools considered are non-invasive instruments to collect information, film activities and analyze emotions through the recognition of their facial expressions. Of the main advances achieved, the results of the systematic review of the literature and a case study are presented, where the identification of the most relevant functional and non-functional characteristics of the software applied in the treatment of ASD is obtained, as well as the proposal framework for the design of accessible computer applications focused on users with this cognitive disability.",

    "abstract": "Control systems are a set of elements focused on regulating the behavior of the systems from an analysis treatment. There are different approaches to systems control. A lot of these focus on the use of intelligent control systems, unfortunately, need large training sets and guarantee slow response times. An alternative is to use the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm, due to considerably fast response times, in most cases, without considering disturbances. There are studies focused on angular position control systems on a rocker arm driven by propellers that, although they work in a plane, provide characteristics corresponding to PVTOL (Planar Vertical TakeOff and Landing) and their derivatives. Some studies apply to test systems, where the propeller is rigid with the arm rotating with the rocker arm. Motivated by the aforementioned fault-tolerant control of a propeller-driven parallelogram pendulum is proposed that varies the previous concept, maintaining the force of the propellers vertically, using a Luenberger state estimator, and applying an approximate model. of Lyapunov, as well as the pole assignment technique.",

The methodology followed is oriented to the development of virtual worlds, where the most important aspects to be taken into account to carry out experimental practices in simulated environments between teachers and students are highlighted. It is concluded that the prototype allows in an interactive and dynamic way to execute hearing simulation practices considering the different roles of an oral litigation case. Also, the methodology can be applied in any simulated environment in different areas that require synchronous interaction with role assignment through multi-user environments.",

    "abstract": "Teaching in the 21st century requires the ability to know and use technological resources that allow the development of virtual learning environments that facilitate the incorporation of educational content and that the student has access to it through educational platforms, while generating environments and situations of learning that allow the development of socio-emotional skills. Socio-emotional skills are the source of differentiation of human talent within the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by continuous technological, scientific and social advancement. Within the use and management of technological tools in the context of education, whether formal or non-formal, the relevance of the use and application offered by these resources to develop the capacities, attitudes and Social and Emotional Skills that any citizen of the world needs XXI century. It is in this context that this article supports the effects of virtual learning environments (PLE) in the development of Social and Emotional Skills in university students. A correlational analysis is made between the use of LMS Platforms (Learning Management System) and the development of Socioemotional Skills of undergraduate students. The research is developed in the population of the Faculty of Accounting and Administration (FCA); attached to the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC), Mexico. A quantitative, descriptive and correlational research is designed. The degree of association between the independent variables socio-emotional skills in three constructs is evaluated: intrapersonal, interpersonal and cognitive, with the dependent variable, virtual learning environments, by means of a structural equation model. For the statistical analysis, the AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) software is used, which allows the construction and validation of a structural model that identifies, specifies, estimates evaluation parameters of adjustment specification of the investigative modeling, as well as its results, integrates the multivariate techniques of Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Models (SEM). A recursive model is obtained, which shows a positive correlation direction between the exogenous variable (LMS) and the endogenous variables (Intrapersonal, Interpersonal and Cognitive). The results reflect a greater correlation in the effects of the use of virtual learning environments (PLE) in the development of interpersonal and cognitive Social and Emotional Skills.",

    "abstract": "A patient’s ability to recall and retrieve health information contributes to a better health management. HealthTalks was developed to address these issues by recording a summary of a medical appointment, uttered by the physician, and transcribing it. For each appointment, the user can also take free-text notes. Nowadays, search engines have become a ubiquitous part of everyone’s life and are expected on most applications. Here, we describe the development of a search engine for HealthTalks. The app’s characteristics demand a lightweight and offline engine, which requires a specific solution rather than an existing library or service. Our approach combines SQLite’s Full-Text Search 4 module, which includes n-gram indexing, with traditional information retrieval techniques to rank the documents. We created a test collection with summaries of clinical appointments (our documents), information needs, search queries, and relevance assessments for an initial search engine evaluation. Using this test collection, we assessed performance using NDCG@10, the first rank position of a totally relevant result, and query latency. Results are promising, with an average NDCG of 0.97. The median rank position of the first relevant result varies between 1.9 and 1.95, depending on the use of 4-gram character tokenization, an aspect that did not significantly affect the results. We expect this work to be useful for future developments of full-text search engines in mobile environments.",

To fight this growing problem, more and more companies in the fashion industry are required to show proof of sustainability which can be a very difficult task as this industry needs global supply chains for their activities, and these are very fragmented and have serious transparency and traceability issues. Thus, there is very poor data quality control, disruptions are hard to communicate and searching for data is very difficult as it often gets lost. A potential solution to these issues is the application of an emerging technology known as Blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed shared ledger technology where all data can be stored in the same network in a secure and immutable way and be accessed by every stakeholder in the supply chain. This article seeks to explore how Blockchain technology can be implemented to improve the sustainability of the production processes of the fashion industry’s supply chain.",

There are techniques and procedures that aim to increase the security of computer systems, such as network protection services, firewalls. They are intended to filter packets that enter and leave a network. Its settings depend on security policies, which consist of documents that describe what is allowed to travel on the network and what is prohibited. The transcription of security policies into rules, written in native firewall language, that represent them, is the main source of errors in firewall configurations. In this work, concepts related to security between networks and firewalls are presented. Related works on security policies and their translations into firewall rules are also referenced. Furthermore, the developed tool, named Fireasy, is presented, which allows the modeling of security policies through graphic elements, and the maintenance of rules written in native firewall language, also representing them in graphic elements. Finally, a controlled experiment was conducted to validate the approach, which indicated, in addition to the correct functioning of the tool, an improvement in the translation of security policies into firewall rules using the tool. In the task of understanding firewall rules, there was a homogenization of the participants' performance when they used the tool.",

A Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image (Panchromatic - PAN and multispectral - MULTI) of a northwestern sector of Peru -where sugar cane crops are evident- is used to generate two fused images, namely: MULTIHPF and MULTITWA. The fused images were evaluated both in spatial and spectral quality through four indices, specifically: correlation index, ERGAS, RASE and Q index, in order to determine the efficiency of the proposed methods. Best results of the spectral evaluation were obtained with the MULTITWA image, achieving correlations higher than 0.95, a Q index of 0.96 and a RASE value of 9.2%, while spatially higher values than 0.96. Regarding spatial richness, the best results were obtained with MULTIHPF with an ERGAS of 14.6, a RASE of 29.3% and a Q of 0.7.",

Amid a propitious global context of increasing of attacks, involving the theft and sabotage on nuclear materials, the swift evolution and diversity of cyber-attacks in different sectors of society and the growing variety and complexity of that types of attacks, it is very difficult to assess the security of critical infrastructures. Considering confidentiality about the design of real facilities and their systems, a nuclear facility and its physical and cyber security systems were modeled in this work. This model is based on international trainings held by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover, the cyber-attack scenario was modeled over one of the critical digital assets of the physical protection system as part of a physical attack. The impacts on the probabilistic performance parameters of the physical protection system, particularly the probability of effectiveness (PE), were evaluated using tools traditionally used in physical systems assessment, such as the EASI (Estimate of Adversary Sequence Interruption), Adversary Sequence Diagrams (ASD) and Multipath Analysis. The results of the study show a significant decrease in the physical protection system effectiveness resulting from a blended cyber-physical attack, enabling not only improvements of nuclear security controls, but also the applicability to other types of critical infrastructure that could not be foreseen by simple regulatory compliance verifications.",

However, there is still some resistance to the use of OERs in doctoral programs and higher education in general. The research question that guides this investigation is which characteristics should an OER developed for doctoral education training have in order to make its use more engaging? Under the methodological approach of Educational Design Research, this investigation will consist of three phases: context analysis, development and formative evaluation, and semi-summative evaluation. In the first phase, a systematic literature review will be conducted to analyze the use of OERs in doctoral education training, and a survey will be carried out among PhD candidates, researchers and practitioners to identify which characteristics can contribute to make OERs an engaging solution to doctoral education training. In the second phase, the OER prototype will be conceptualized, designed and developed. This prototype will go through cycles of formative evaluation, and as feedback is being received, adjustments and improvements will be carried out. In the third and and last phase, a semi-summative evaluation will be performed to make the last adjustments to the OER and finally disseminate the results in doctoral programs in TEL.",

    "abstract": "Data leakage by employees is a matter of concern for companies and organizations today. Previous studies have shown that existing Data Leakage Protection (DLP) systems on the market, the more secure they are, the more intrusive and tedious they are to work with. This paper proposes and assesses the implementation of four technologies that enable the development of secure file systems for insider threat-focused, low-intrusive and user-transparent DLP tools. Two of these technologies are configurable features of the Windows operating system (Minifilters and Server Message Block), the other two are virtual file systems (VFS) Dokan and WinFsp, which mirror the real file system (RFS) allowing it to incorporate security techniques. In the assessment of the technologies, it was found that the implementation of VFS was very efficient and simple. WinFsp and Dokan presented a performance of 51% and 20% respectively, with respect to the performance of the operations in the RFS. This result may seem relatively low, but it should be taken into account that the calculation includes read and write encryption and decryption operations as appropriate for each prototype. Server Message Block (SMB) presented a low performance (3%) so it is not considered viable for a solution like this, while Minifilters present the best performance but require high programming knowledge for its evolution. The prototype presented in this paper and its strategy provides an acceptable level of comfort for the user, and a high level of security.",

    "abstract": "Integrating data in data lakes is essential so we can perform more complex analyses. However, data lakes are mainly composed of raw data, from structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured data. It turns out that traditional data integration algorithms usually expect to receive structured data as input, so those different types of data jeopardize big data integration. This paper presents a systematic literature review that generates a broad landscape about data integration in data lakes. We searched for papers in eight well-known search engines, following a structured process. From the 298 papers we retrieved, we selected 22 papers that answer our research questions. We identify examples of data lake integration models, how they calculate the similarity among the datasets, how the models are evaluated, the most common type of data they integrate, and the challenges inherent to the area, which points to future research directions in data integration in data lakes.",

Among the messages disseminated are those of an emotional, reflective, optimistic and even entertaining nature. This behavior has been analyzed by some authors, calling this adaptation of brand discourse to the reality of an existing crisis as Advertcrisis. The objective of this study is to analyze how KFC, Cinemark and Samsung adapted their communication on Facebook during the COVID-19 crisis. It should be noted that these brands market internationally; however, the study of their communication was based on the social networks they manage in Peru. Therefore, the study is subject to a national market. To do so, a comparative review of the messages before and during the crisis was carried out through a qualitative research based on the case study. The results were contrasted with theoretical reflections, obtaining as a result that the three brands were immersed in the scenario described by the Advertcrisis theory.",

In the area of the industry, has a higher influence and it is encompassed in the term Industry 4.0. This revolution, generate a new era, in which virtual manufacturing and productive systems work together with the physical ones [1]. This will require the evolution of the production plants to develop to the \"Smart Factory\" [3], where it is necessary connect all systems or machines, to enable the interaction between machine and human, as well as machine-to-machine, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). To achieve this level of connectivity is necessary to implement sensors in all systems or machines of which data acquisition is required. Focusing in the logistic of a plant, the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology is one of the most used, but this this technology has some constraints that must be addressed, as the limitations of the power supply from the RFID \"tags\". In this article, it will deepen in how to improve the autonomy of the power supply of the \"tags\", with two proposals to optimize the use of the sensor, taking in account the type of logistic management implemented.",

To achieve the objectives, a descriptive and exploratory study was developed and an online questionnaire was used for data collection. Specifically in this article, we analyze the results related to the first section of the questionnaire and related to student’s media consumption and practices. The results obtained allow us to conclude that students essentially use social media and television to keep themselves informed about what happens in the country and in the world, with the printed newspaper being the least used medium. In terms of the use of devices and technologies, most students consider that the main functions of the internet are to inform and entertain, they mostly use the smartphone to establish and maintain contacts, and the main function of social networks is entertainment. The relevance and main contribution of this study is, among others, to allow the characterization of habits and practices of media consumption, as well as to enable the identification of specific strategies for a generation that clearly has different habits of information consumption.",

For an enterprise architecture to play a central role in organizations, it must focus on processes, people, activities, workflows, relevant information, and must facilitate the translation of corporate strategy into daily operations. This is the only way to achieve EA objectives, which include improving efficiency, timeliness and reliability of business information. EA models support these goals by creating more transparency, measurability, and consistency [2]. For EA to do its job and add value to the organization, all information, data, processes, architectures and technologies need to be in sync with the business, which means they need to be constantly updated, which requires constant maintenance of the enterprise architecture. Thus, the solution proposed at the end of this document consists of a proposal for a constant maintenance of the EA that will contribute to the quality of the EA and, consequently, to the success of the organization.",

Different studies have been made on the frequency of occurrence of letters in several languages, but as we know there are not thorough studies on the occurrence of letters according to the readability of a text. The main objective of the present work is to study the frequency of occurrence of letters in a text according to its legibility. This occurrence will be approached from two points of view. First, through the so-called power indices of game theory. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a game is associated with a text and the influence or power of each letter will be analysed by means of the so-called power indices of the game theory. Thus, we present a new application of game theory. Second, by means of basic statistics to study relative frequency of letters in a text.",

One of the reasons identified for this migratory flow is the academic training of these individuals, who seek to train in higher quality educational institutions. In this context, this work aims to analyze how the scientific exodus occurs in Brazil, in which individuals from different parts of the country migrate in search of better academic training. Therefore, in this study, it was analyzed how the Brazilian scientific exodus occurs. For this, it was necessary to extract academic training data from the curricula of individuals registered on the Lattes Platform. Therefore, all individuals with a completed doctorate were selected, aggregating 308,317 curricula. Initially, the data was filtered, selecting the attributes relevant to the research, and finally, the data processing was carried out in order to find the geographic location of the institutions in which the individuals were trained. As initial results, it was possible to characterize the data collected on the Lattes Platform, measuring the distances covered by individuals throughout their academic training. Link networks were made demonstrating the main locations occupied by doctors during their academic training, as well as the connections between these locations. Thus, it was possible to present an unprecedented portrait of how the Brazilian scientific exodus occurs.",

    "abstract": "The experience of purchasing a good is highly influenced by various technologies that have not only impacted the shopping experience but have also significantly changed the way brands work on their digital presence. Augmented reality, a technology that delivers multisensory experiences that merge the real world with the digital, discussed in this article, is gaining presence in retail. The multidisciplinary teams of companies in this field, often through their branders and brand managers, have proposed creating and promoting distinctive technological experiences that put the user/customer at the centre. This trend has taken hold in physical retail and increasingly in online retail, which has experienced an unpredictable surge prior to the pandemic associated with COVID19. This paper aims to provide a literature review to understand better the state of the art of Augmented Reality (AR) in the retail space and its evolution in recent years and to identify the brands that have invested the most in this technology. Using SCOPUS and Web of Science as a research base, the work presented here shows that although research in this area already exists, it is perhaps still in an introductory phase in this field and is still looking for greater maturity in the use of AR in the consumer experience.",

According to the Ministry of Health data, an increase in the occupancy of Intensive Care Unit beds is observed. This high number of cases added to the capacity of few hospital beds causes the increase in patients whom medical centres in Peru cannot treat. We present MoniCovid as an application to monitor health parameters periodically and ensure the treatment and stability for patients with suspicions or mild COVID-19 symptoms and who belong to the low socioeconomic levels that represent more than half of the Peruvian population. In addition, it allows physicians to review follow-up reports for each patient and determine if they need emergency care. We use the methodology of Building Progressive Web Apps book to incorporate native functionality into the web application. In this way, MoniCovid becomes a multiplatform capable application that allows it to be acquired by many patients. A case study in Lima showed that MoniCovid application is functional and allows reducing the time of patient monitoring and medical diagnosis by 70.89% and 56.56% respectively. In addition, a user acceptance of 4.74 in usability and 4.71 in user experience.",

A survey was applied to contain 13 objective questions to collect information related to human fatigue that impacts operational performance through the perception of operators who work in operational bodies. As a result, obtained through the 108 responses, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied, which revealed that, according to the perception of the interviewees, the model explains the operational performance in 34.7 %, alertness by 29.9%, and reaction time by 31.2%. Thus, it is expected that from this research, the proposed suggestions related to the variables will be implemented to preserve the professional's health and operational safety.",

Based on the LOCUS project, this article intends, through the vision of the residents, to understand their preferences and what they value most in Second Life. The focus is on the space and the places they most like and what they value; on communication, that is, how are the communicational interactions between residents and preferences; and, on playability (if there is playability and if there is interest in this topic). In this way, the respondents' answers will be a trigger to build the interaction and playability of the village of Amiais in Second Life.

This exploratory study details a study performed at a Portuguese university to assess the role of social networks in the students’ academic performance. We used an online questionnaire to collect. From the variety of network centrality measures considered, findings suggest that students with high centrality positions within the friendship network tend to present lower academic performance, except for eigenvector centrality (i.e., being connected to students who are themselves well connected). On advice and working group networks, there was minimal evidence of the relation between key positions and grades. Although there was not an overall homophily towards grades – neither through selection nor influence mechanisms – students with lower academic achievement tended to stablish friendship ties between themselves.",

    "abstract": "Defining rules for finding all the uncountable patterns of events of interest, in complex and critical applications, is infeasible, if not impossible. Anomaly Detection (AD) methods are techniques well-suited for tackling this category of problem, namely, finding previously unknown deviant data due to their ability for identifying behavior that significantly went astray from an expected pattern. Isolation Forest (IF) is a state-of-the-art technique in the unsupervised Anomaly Detection area, mainly because of efficacy and low computational cost. However, unsupervised Anomaly Detection many times suffers from high false-positive rate and high false-negative rate. Semi-supervised techniques, e.g. Hybrid Isolation Forest (HIF)l can significantly improve the unsupervised algorithms with low human effort, and can also aggregate semantic knowledge into the models. HIF, however, can only aggregate known anomalies in a single class. This paper proposes a Hybrid Isolation Forest-based model capable of aggregating known anomalies in many classes, without loss of performance. Our proposed multiple anomaly classes semi-supervised model showed better performance in some known datasets, as well as showed the ability to significantly improve the underlying unsupervised algorithm.",

The architecture analysis and detailed design are part of the key efforts for the correct development and continuity of the solution. The teaching of software engineering still has many challenges to solve. One of these challenges is the teaching of software design, since the efforts made during the course often end up in a dead document when moving on to the construction phase. This problem also occurs in the industry. The reviewed works show different approaches to solve this problem. The objective of this work is to propose a tool based on the model-driven approach to create class diagrams and transform them into the source code. Also, you can make changes to the diagram during construction stages and stay in sync with the code. The results show an encouraging experience with the use of the tool by students of the software design course during an academic semester.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of ICT in teaching and educational processes has become an irreversible fact. The degree of use of computers, Internet and software depends on many macro- and micro-social factors. Among the key factors related to the effective use of ICT in schools, the attitude to new media among educators, parents, students and management should be singled out. A group that requires special consideration is also the new teaching staff - students of teacher education courses. This is the future generation of teachers, the vast majority of whom grew up in the phase of intensive development of the information society. This text is an attempt to answer what attitudes to the use of ICT in education do the students of pedagogy have? Based on the analysis of qualitative data (students' statements) conducted in Poland in January 2022, it was noted that: 1) The use of ICTs at the current stage of development of the information society is a natural necessity; 2) The use of ICTs is something obvious for pupils and students also in the area of learning; 3) Teachers should use ICTs due to the increase of motivation and involvement; 4) ICTs have become a complement to analogue teaching means; 5) New media bring new opportunities in teaching and educational activities; 6) Teachers who use ICT regularly and effectively are considered more modern than those who use only analogue means of teaching; 7) ICT (e-learning) has become a necessity in modern schools, which was especially noticed during the COVID pandemic.",

These actions must promote the management of the various interest groups, as well as the establishment of an identity based on sustainability. For this, companies need to have guides and principles that allow them to mark a course of action, one of these guides is given by the Ethos indicators, through which companies can self-detect and undertake improvement strategies. Among several aspects that Ethos analyzes, there is the indicator of values, transparency, and corporate governance as the initial axis of CSR. This document analyzes the performance of Ecuadorian companies in terms of compliance with the indicator of values, transparency, and corporate governance. The investigation included a total of 326 companies, both micro, small, medium and large throughout the country. The questionnaire was applied to the managers or representatives of the organizations object of this study.",

The 43 districts of Lima, the capital city of Peru, were used as a case study. Primary data about the presence and audience of these local governments on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube was collected to support the analyses. Main conclusions are that socioeconomic dynamism and previous experience in implementing e-government are relevant determinants of both adoption and audience; and that population size is a relevant determinant of audience but not a relevant determinant of adoption. These results contribute to the theory by further validating and complementing results that were previously obtained in other Latin-American countries and in other regions in the world.",

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the influence of cooperation in the development of innovation in tourism companies. To achieve this objective, a quantitative approach was chosen through surveys and the hypotheses were verified through the Chi square statistical test. The results obtained showed that the relationship between innovation and cooperation, measured by the variables \"internal and external sources of information, type of cooperative organizations and type of valuable partners\", is not very significant. It is concluded that it is necessary to work on overcoming the weaknesses identified, since this will allow obtaining the benefits that companies that make decisions together have, face the current context and achieve objectives that would be impossible to do in isolation, giving way to the co-creation of innovative services.",

The mixed approach is used that allows analyzing the informative notes through the \"Web Scraping\" compilation process, in addition, semi-structured, intentional interviews were carried out with an academic expert in economics, an advisor in the field of cryptocurrencies, an academic of communication and an editor journalist expert in business. It is established that the newspapers El Comercio and El Universo have an abundant number of articles per year, and these have been developing according to their temporality and problems, it can be indicated that the private sector has a greater interest in terms of the income of cryptocurrencies; the newspaper El Telégrafo, on the other hand, does not have a high coverage of the subject, which indicates its low interest. It is concluded that blockchain technology and the use of bitcoin develops a new trend that affects cultural, political, journalistic aspects, mainly economics, its use will allow transforming processes to a digital age without control of national states.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in Ecuador. The results based on public information of 28 operations between the period 2012 to 2020 showed growth with a total investment of US$2.4 million. The Fast-moving consumer goods industry accounted for 50% of the deals with an investment of US$919 million. Regarding the level of integration, 88% corresponded to acquisitions of companies mainly in the food, oil, and mining sectors. Consolidation of holding companies is the principal economic motivation for mergers and acquisitions. Finally, the study for the Ecuadorian context proposes evidence that describes the evolution of the sector and guides decision-making for investors in the market.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing (EC) is a recent computing paradigm in the IoT domain for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user instead of moving all data to the cloud. In this way, EC practitioners aim to replicate the benefits of cloud computing but closer to the source of the data, reducing the latency imposed by the distance between the cloud and the end devices, the network overhead, and the security and privacy risk that this offloading entails. But not only that. EC practitioners also aim to replicate best practices used on cloud-native development and operation. In this regard, GitOps is one of the main trends in the DevOps ecosystem for Continuous Deployment (CD) that promotes infrastructure automation in highly distributed applications, accelerating value delivery while avoiding error-prone manual processes. Till now, GitOps has been mainly related to Kubernetes—a widely used container orchestration platform to run distributed applications resiliently. In this regard, more and more IoT EC solutions are implementing container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes, thus, it is worthwhile identifying the benefits that GitOps adoption could leverage at the Edge and how possible challenges and drawbacks could be addressed. This paper presents a proof of concept based on tools included in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape to check the feasibility of applying GtiOps in IoT EC solutions. Several drawbacks were detected mainly due to the used tooling, such as lack of automatic provisioning of physical infrastructure, tight coupled to Kubernetes descriptors for declaring workloads, and limitations on the edge devices that can be supported.",

The results based on the experiments showed that the banks are grouped into 4 clusters, where the weights of the IC variable and its components were lower than the weights of the ROA and ROE variables as measures of financial performance.",

Being a COVID-19 pandemic year, the sector's performance has not been as expected. It has been studied which variables are influential in the EVA. The results determined that earnings before interest and taxes (BAIT) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) had a positive impact on EVA, while weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and return on invested capital (ROIC) were not significant for EVA performance. Company management should design actions that contribute to wealth generation taking into account the level of post-pandemic risk.",

Portugal was used as a case study: the Facebook pages of 84 Portuguese municipalities were analyzed during November 2021, making a total of 6,897 posts that generated 25,761 comments and 432,031 likes. Facebook posts were classified according to a set 18 content types. Most published content types and the content types that generate more interactions were analyzed, among other factors. Main conclusions are that the population explains 54% of the number of page likes; that the number of page likes explains 49% of the number of posts likes; that the number of page likes explains 44% of the number of posts comments; that most published topics relate to culture (31%) and health (11%); that there is no correlation between the most published topics and the ones that get the most likes and comments; and that more political topics stand out in the number of likes and, specially, the number of comments obtained. These conclusions contribute to both confirm and extend the extant knowledge on the subject, namely by showing that political topics generate more interactions than other content types.",

The method used to better understand the evolution and impact of blockchain technology was a bibliometric analysis. A search was conducted at digital Elsevier’s database with a single keyword blockchain, and 23383 articles were collected. The study uses cluster analysis method, allowing to construct and visualize bibliometric networks and to build co-occurrences networks. The results indicate that there are positive correlations between countries, that China and the United States are part of the most influential cluster.

To do this, companies were classified as zombies if they had three years of negative equity. In addition, it was analyzed whether the zombie company was related to the capital structure. This was determined through three ratios: debt-equity (DT), short-term debt-assets (DCP) and long-term debt-assets (DLP). Through a logit regression, it was determined that an increase in these variables is associated with a greater probability of being a zombie, so the managers of these companies must maintain reasonable ratios so that the companies have a correct financial situation.",

Bibliometricians apply mathematical and statistical methods to quantify scholarly communications. Using the Bibliometrix program, a database compiled from SCOPUS and Web of science was studied to study the different scientific and literary behaviours of rural tourism development, tourism sustainability, and outdoor activities. In the main database steps, 161 articles were analysed, of which 61 were SCOPUS articles, and 100 were Web of Science articles. As per this database, the relationship between rural tourism with sustainable tourism and outdoor activities, through a bibliometric analysis, looks to study the annual scientific production, the research impact, the authors, and articles most relevant to the themes of research trends over the years. Several interesting and important conclusions were obtained from these results for developing the themes. The results of this study indicate that sustainable tourism and rural tourism have extreme relevance to the studies carried out. Hence, rural tourism and outdoor activities are increasingly sustaining a relationship of partnership, much due to the influences of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Tourism is facing serious difficulties worldwide due to the global pandemic COVID-19, translating considerably into an industry effort to compete in the marketplace. In effect, sustainable tourism is considered to have a symbiotic relationship with competitiveness that will allow organisations to make a difference. This means that the sustainability factors are positively related to the competitiveness indicators. In this context, as the oliviculture sector faces challenges in a changing market in terms of ecological, demographic, and consumption practices changes, it is considered that sustainable tourism will enable the sector to make a difference. For, the environmental and social changes of the stakeholders enhance the promotion of sustainability to meet their needs, which in turn increases the sector's competitive advantage. In this respect, the present study was based on a literature review consolidated in a bibliometric analysis to analyse sustainable tourism as a driver of competitiveness in the oliviculture industry. For this purpose, the Scopus database was used, in which 157 full articles published until September 2021 were obtained. Based on the results, using the Bibliometrix R, it was found that research in this field has emerged in the last 20 years and focuses particularly on the terms \"competitiveness\", \"ecotourism\" and \"tourism development\". In addition, the countries with the highest scientific production and citations, the main sources of publication in this field of research, the documents with the most citations as well as the co-citations between authors were analysed. Through bibliometric analysis, it is possible to provide researchers, policy-makers and managers with a current view of the undoubted role that sustainable tourism plays in the competitiveness of the olive sector. Considering the trends, it is therefore expected to contribute bases for future strategies aimed at overcoming obstacles, overcoming challenges, and seizing opportunities for a more competitive sector.",

Thus, the case study of the city of Loja is taken, analyzing the cadastral base of the same for the estimation of direct economic losses due to damage to vulnerable buildings in the city. The results show that the parish with the greatest probable impact on buildings is Punzara. The use of the information has made it possible to disaggregate some recommendations such as updating and improving the variables described in the city's urban cadastre.",

    "abstract": "Traceability in manufacturing, for any type of industry, enables the tracking of products' components throughout the manufacturing chain, from raw materials to the final product, passing through each intermediate component and process stage, on every industrial player in the chain. The information generated through the manufacturing process, including certificates and inspection results, is registered and thus trackable. In the shipbuilding industry, the process of building a ship is complex, has several stages, and it is important to guarantee high-quality levels during the manufacturing process. For this, the methods and technologies adopted for process traceability must be selected, having in mind the specific requirements and constraints of the shipbuilding industry in the most efficient way. In addition, process traceability may add value to the ship, as all the traceable information may be easily transferred to the end customer. This way, the customer can have the information of any material, component, part, and block of the ship easily and reliably, as well as all the certificates and documents necessary for any process. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system architecture that fosters the traceability of the production processes applied to the shipbuilding industry based on the West Sea Viana Shipyards. The system will be implemented as a case study in the manufacturing process of a shipbuilding block, and therefore readily extendable to the overall ship manufacturing process. The blockchain-based system will contain or refer to all relevant documents (certificates, warranties, etc.) and other pertinent manufacturing data that can be delivered to the customer together with the ship, thus increasing trustability.",

However, the growing wave of public activities digitization worldwide has aroused the interest of environmentalists who have been concerned about \"digital pollution\" as a factor that degrades the environment. That is why this study aims to analyse the relationship between environmental variables and electronic government. The main results suggest that there is a direct relationship between the geographic concentration of CO2 emissions, as a proxy for environmental variables, and the rate of development of electronic government. The findings are heterogeneous when we carry out an analysis considering the countries according to their level of income per capita.",

This report concentrates on analysing the importance of distribution within the printed periodical publications sector and herein addresses the study of the evolution of the points of sale in Spain, drastically affected by the impacts of Digital Society. The approach focuses on a territorial perspective, with the analysis divided by autonomous regions. Points of sale data and associated trends are compared against population and area data in order to determine the evolution in terms of geographical coverage, given the particular nature of the type of product that is commercialized - to some extent it acts as a guarantor of a fundamental right, in terms of democratic quality, such as the access to information. The results, based on the available data comprising the time preceding the COVID pandemic, are not encouraging at all, reporting a marked decline in the number of points of sale across the nation and, subsequently, a drop in the number of stores per square kilometer and by population. This indicates a fall in the ease of access to these products by the general population: in some cases, these being the only ones that specific groups of society have when accessing information provided by printed publications, as well as for certain entertainment purposes, in particular in regions of the country identified with the ‘España Vaciada' (the hollowed-out Spain) slogan.",

The application of IoT to the industrial environment leads to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), in which industrial processes are managed through IoT, thus allowing industry workers to better control their facilities and processes. However, IIoT applications have very strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as short response times, that require for the deployment of their services in edge nodes, close to the facilities. In IIoT scenarios, deploying each of the services so that the QoS requirements are met is not an easy task. Moreover, the dynamicity of the environment requires for a fast, adaptive solution. In this position paper, we propose DeQALE, an approach to train a deep reinforcement learning agent to solve this problem in short cycles.",

In addition, this industry often resorts to countries with cheap labor where workers’ rights are typically not met. The solution may involve the final consumer who, while purchasing these products, supports the entire value chain. If the final consumer chooses to buy products that are more socially and environmentally sustainable, it inspires the industry to follow this trend. For this, the final consumer must know the social and environmental indicators of the entire value chain and must trust on the information received. In this paper, Design Science Research is being used to build a system architecture capable of tracing these environmental and social indicators using decentralized and distributed technologies, like blockchain and smart contracts, to build Decentralized Applications (DApp).",

However, it appears that many organizations, despite making high investments in development, even if they present a visually attractive website, face difficulties in attracting visitors. In the case of the tourism sector, in which competition takes place on a global level, it is even more pressing for technologies to reach potential stakeholders, first attracting visitors, then seducing them and converting them into customers. In this context, digital marketing techniques, and more specifically, website optimization techniques to improve their visibility by search engines (Search Engine Optimization) are the key to leveraging the potential for visits to any website. In this article, digital marketing concepts and the technological aspects that affect the indexing made by search engines will be explored. The case study presented intends to demonstrate, in a simplified way, the importance and applicability of these concepts and techniques, proposing a set of improvements that should be implemented to improve the positioning of the \"Termas de Chaves\" website in the search engine page results.",

However, in these regions, most points of tourist interest are scattered, do not have a support structure to receive visitors and, consequently, are difficult to explore for tourism in a profitable way. This article describes a platform that uses technology to expand and enhance opportunities for exploring tourist points and interest in low-density rural territories. This platform provides features for tour operators to publicize and make their points of interest available to tourists, allowing tourists to access certain points of interest automatically using IoT devices, after validation. This possibility is particularly important in low-density territories. This article describes the platform and the results of a preliminary evaluation, at the level of acceptance tests, which allowed to obtain feedback on the interest and usefulness that the application may have.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, people are increasingly adopting a healthier way of life. A healthy and balanced diet is essential for a better quality of life. A good diet helps to prevent and fight diseases. Thus, people are giving more importance to the food they consume. Consumers no longer seek foods based on their brand, but rather based on features such as nutritional value or sustainability. These features are directly related to all stages of a product’s value chain, from its creation (cultivation) until it reaches the final consumer. In order for the final consumer to have access to this information, it is necessary to create ways to ensure that this information is available and reliable, thus consolidating consumer confidence. This article focuses on traceability in Olive Oil production chain and its quality indicators as well as social and environmental sustainability indicators. It is therefore intended to create a solution by using Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts.",

    "abstract": "In recent years the Internet of Things, in addition to use cases in 'smart cities', has also increasingly been used in precision agriculture. As in the rest of the world, it has been a growing reality in Portugal. In an agricultural environment, where energy resources can be scarce and dispersed, the implementation of a LoRa network with autonomous sensor nodes must consider the limitations imposed by the energy consumed by the sensor node, when powered by a battery and a solar panel. For this, experimental tests must be carried out so that there is enough data for the implementation and optimization of the devices. This article presents a work focused on the study of the autonomy and energy efficiency of the sensor device, using algorithms capable of managing energy consumption as a function of the luminosity of the place. Preliminary results attest to the relevance of this approach, keeping the sensor node in operation without interruptions.",

The study is also intended to assess the level of knowledge about new audit trends and their respective audit potential. The results obtained demonstrate that technological evolution has, in the auditors' opinion, a positive impact on the audit, regardless of the tools used. It is also concluded that, given this evolution, tests of controls and substantive procedures must necessarily be adjusted. Considering the context of permanent change, this study also showed that auditors are aware and prepared for possible changes in their work as new technological trends require.",

To this end, semi-structured interviews were carried out with people who deal with accounting professionals, as well as focus groups, in which professors, students and recent graduates in accounting participated. The evidence allows us to conclude that the accountant of the future will have a more technological profile, with knowledge in business intelligence, big data and analytics, and data mining. The accounting profession can find in digital transformation an important opportunity to expand its functions, more related to the treatment and analysis of large amounts of data.

    "abstract": "In Portugal, since the financial crisis, the number of SME´s that have gone into insolvency is quite high and really worrying due the impacts they cause on the Portuguese economy and society. Although several insolvencies predictive models have already been developed whose predictors are, essentially, financial information, this matter is still critical today, so it is extremely important to continue to investigate and create models with greater precision than the previous ones. In this way, and as the company´s financial statements do not always show their true economic and financial reality, this study assesses the impact of the characteristics of the audit firm and audit opinion content in predicting insolvency. To this end, more advanced data analysis techniques are used, namely text mining and decision trees with the CART algorithm to analyse the audit report between the years 2016 and 2020 of a sample of 2.040 companies, 1.020 non-insolvent and 1.020 insolvent. The results obtained indicate the existence of a relationship between the audit opinion content as well as the characteristics of the audit firm and the company’s insolvencies, achieving an accuracy of 93%. Therefore, the main empirical contribution of this investigation is to bring the best knowledge about the unfeasible of companies through the external audit activity, using new techniques have never used in predictive models.",

Data governance (DG) importance emerges to support the data flow, to record and manage knowledge derived from data, as well as establishing roles, accountabilities, and strategies, which further results in better decision-making. Through the definition of strategies to manage data in a consistent manner, data governance establishes the path to an enterprise-wide standardization, providing unchallenging access, management, and analysis of data to derive useful insights. Research on data governance frameworks is limited and lacks a key perspective: how can firms ensure sustainability on their programs. Data governance programs can only be continuously valuable if supported by a holistic framework focused on sustainability. To understand this gap, five frameworks are presented, analyzed and evaluated according to an assessment matrix based on eleven critical success factors (CSF) for data governance. As a result of this study, where we offer a more comprehensive assessment tool, both researchers and practitioners can understand the maturity level of each CSF in the reviewed frameworks and identify which areas need further exploration and how to accomplish higher data governance maturity levels.",

    "abstract": "The Cyberspace has reshaped the boundaries of the dispute fields used by organizations and governments. Organizational security doctrines and strategies have been adapted to face the evergrowing complexity of cyber threats. Part of the success in surviving in that environment depends on the ability one has to understand the nature of the threats aiming the systems to be protected. In this work, we propose a framework to map high complex cyber threats to help technical and management personnel with the task of generating useful knowledge, both in corporate and government cyber security sectors.",

    "abstract": "The design and development of learning objects for higher education, currently surpassed by competences based approach, require a well known structure and pedagogical rules. Educators need both a methodology and tools to guide them through these processes, to provide valid and reliable learning objects as outcomes. With the objective of addressing these needs, this paper presents an ontology based conceptual model. It defines a Learning objects structure, restrictions and relationships among components, and pedagogical rules. Then a recommender system that guides educators in the learning objects creation process, can be developed based on this conceptual model proposed.",

    "abstract": "Managing information systems with an external provider became a common practice in the public sector mostly due to expectations of reduced costs and better capabilities in this area. ITO is not new to public management practice, in fact, these organizations are known to maintain long term relationships with multiple suppliers, even though the results and the success of ITO in this sector is harder to demonstrate. There is also, a recognition of different priorities and contextual factors that determine ITO success. There also a reduced number of european authors investigating ITO success in the public setor. We acknowledged that none are from Portugal, therefore, we propose to investigate ITO success in the portuguese public setor and evaluate the effect of partnership quality, organizational capabilities and top management support.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve carbon emissions' target imposed by the European commission, there were exceptional measures executed. The goal was to encourage the use of public transport in urban areas. It was assumed in this study that digitalization at the service of users and managers of public transport networks is a key instrument to improve their efficiency and attractiveness. Given the topicality and importance of the subject, it was pertinent to establish as the core goal of this work, not only the study of the currently used mobile applications within the urban areas of Lisbon and Porto, but also its impacts on the development of public transportation. Ultimately it was intended to identify among the users, the need for possible developments. As a methodology, an exploratory focus group was used at first. Therefore, it was possible to gain a comprehensive understanding on the users of public transports, their preferences, and which applications they most commonly use. Additionally, at the end of the focus group an inferential survey was also analyzed, amended and validated. This survey had the main objective of collecting the necessary data for analyzing the impact of an application for mobile devices, with the goal of improve the quality of public transport. After reviewing the results, it was possible to conclude that it exists a wide range of digital applications available on the market. In fact, these applications allow the mitigation of some transport problems/issues, thus improving the user experience of public means of transportation. This leads to the conclusion that it has a positive impact on the user. Finally, the need to improve current functions and even add new features was also identified.",
