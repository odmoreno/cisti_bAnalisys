    "abstract": "Considering the importance of the management of Learning Content Management System (LCMS) in pedagogical strategy of higher education modernisation, it becomes essential to develop tools, reliable and adapted to the context, to collect students' perceptions on the issue. Additionally, it is important that this information may be linked to other sources, in particular, with the reports of LCMS, in such a way as to promote a more coherent management. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the scale \"LCMS integration in teaching activities of higher education\". The methodological approach to the subject has developed along three steps: 1-Identification and development of the dimensions and writing of individual items; 2-Validation of the content of the instrument by a panel of experts and graduate students with deep experience in the use of the LCMS; 3-Administration of scale and psychometric analysis. The dimensions of the final version of the scale are related very closely with information from reports of LCMS. The objective is to analyze, crossing information from two sources, a factor which potentially increases management effectiveness. It was constituted a convenience sample of 54 students attending undergraduate and master's Universidade Católica do Porto. The results suggest that the scale has good psychometric properties.",

However, a problem arises when it comes to interacting with devices of this kind. Thus, even if most of the population is capable of working with them, there are collectives, like the elderly, that have great difficulties in this task. To reduce the digital divide existing for this society section, we propose a platform that uses Near Field Communication (NFC) and semantic technologies. Its aim is to provide different services to the user based on the reading of a combination of tags with a mobile phone, making interaction with these devices easier and more user-friendly.",

In the last two decades considerable contributions incorporating creative mechanisms in computer applications were made. Recently, the discussion is turning towards the problems that are under the process of evaluating computer created visual objects, mainly in the area related to the automating aesthetic evaluation. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of the process of evaluating visual objects (with the help of human cognitive process of evaluation) in the specific area of visual arts, within computerized systems. By means of an empirical and automated approach we surveyed human subjects for the classification of the concept of creativity. Simultaneously, 804 features were extracted from around 2600 images used in order to model the human classification through an artificial neural network. This work proposes the use of classification models to understand the human creativity perception in a set of images. This is an important aspect not only to classify a product as being novel, but also to provide information about the creativity perception.",

Furthermore, these devices are more and more important not only in business contexts, but also in particular ones. The efficiency of a user performing a task with a mobile device can drastically vary because of its context dependency. Therefore, it is vital to measure the efficiency of the user regarding the surrounding environment. The current methods tend to discard the variation of characteristics of the context where a mobile application is executed. Through this work a new context and interaction model focused on mobile applications is exposed. First, the capture method that adds the minimum deviations caused by external factors to the assessment results has been studied. Then, a system based on a library for Android devices that captures and measures the defined model and the user efficiency is shown and validated.",

In architecture, shape grammars can work with rules which will convey legal restrictions, space needs and goals that the architect needs or wants to fulfil, creating possible solutions to a project. A wide range of solutions can be tested in computational application based in shape grammars. These applications can also encourage the architect to go further in his creativity through the shape emergence where the conditions are fulfilled and presented as innovative and/or unexpected. Due to the strict rules they have to obey and to the issues they are supposed to respond and, not being a mere artistic intention but rather a response to a specific need/objective intention (space building), architectural projects show a set of common phases which might take a lot of advantages from computational applications and at the same time respond not only to the technical needs but also to the creative goals.",

Also, we have used data on concepts Database 4 curricula Database of foreign universities between are: MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (USA), University of Berkeley (U.S.), Imperial College London (UK) and University of Manchester (UK). The interest of this research is the need to adapt university studies plans in Spain to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This obliged the design and implementation of new curricula in Spanish universities. In our field of work we consider it necessary to study the content on the new curriculum in Computer called, in most cases, Degrees in Computer Science. In summary, we were interested to analyze, in these degrees in Computer Science, the subject content of databases. We focused on content that are part of the fundamentals or basic concepts that students need to know when dealing with first-time databases. The curricula were analyzed by performing a qualitative analysis software NVIVO v.8.0, resulting in 164 simple categories that form the subject content of the curriculum of subjects Database. Starting from these and grouping by topic, we have obtained 10 categories, which are referred to by a single name simple the categories that have some relationship between them.",

Persuasion is one of them and it is predominantly based in first order logic. However, this type of dialogue is not an adequate approach for solving complex problems - those that can't be solved in polynomial time. This paper presents a persuasion model for MAS which consider the fitness function of a genetic algorithm (GA) for reaching agreements in problem solving. The resulting persuasion model provides each member of MAS with a fitness function capable of guiding agents in the reach of agreements. The evaluation we did enabled us to state that the model could have a positive impact for solving complex problems with MAS. In contrast with previous studies, our results highlight the importance of using a GA persuasion model for solving complex problems and we depict the implications of our findings in its design considerations.",

With the evolution of systems based on distributed processing, using the Internet and cloud computing systems can develop much more effective and efficient, particularly in the health field. The proposed system involves the creation of databases, distributed or not, with integration of Web services that may give access to clinical data in patients by using of a health card, accessible through electronic reader devices (micro-chips) or by scanning, namely through a mobile device. The project will consider the legal and ethical aspects underlying medical activities, so that only authorized personnel have access to this information. Although there are integrated systems for registration of clinical data in Health Centers and Hospitals, this information is not available to be accessed remotely via a Smartphone or Tablet / PC. The system presented here, will allow access and registration of clinical data remotely, either by medical assistance teams, or by medical teams that serve patients in the usual places. To this end we propose the creation of an electronic health card that will be the primary means of transaction data.",

Finally, a catalog of techniques and strategies is generated in order to tackle each module, clearing up that all the layers can be customized according to the particular needs of the company which wants to use this method. This work offers: baseline architecture; definition of stages, activities as well as transition artifacts which are generated throughout the innovation/co-creation process; ubiquitous environment characterization; set of ways to ease the interaction among stakeholders based on the good practices and tools offered by social networks. Partial conclusions reveal the importance of establishing mechanisms to ease the interaction between the stakeholders who participate in a co-creation process by means of the cutting edge technologies in other application fields.",

Through the environment, students can perform exercises, group activities and assessments at any time, anywhere and still receive a return automatically. The developed system receives as input the source SQL written by the student and evaluates the structure according to the groups of problems: syntax, number of columns, number of rows, content attributes, Order By, number of tables and concept. The \"tip\" is a recommendation tailored to each group specific problem, which will help the student in questions or errors. There is a great student interactivity with the environment, because it can refer n-fold program code to be evaluated, without overwhelming the teacher's work. The experiments performed during this project indicate significant results.",

The research method was the literature of the concepts, along with analysis of relevant articles and events on the use of technology without moral responsibility, opposed to morality. The qualitative analysis pointed facts about the user as to the morality, ethics and safety in the use of available technologies, it was found that the lack of moral and ethical concepts is still a barrier to the user, for the organization and the e-society, with each one the arduous task of separating the morale of the immoral.",

The time spent to correct an assessment is high and the teacher cannot maintain the same level of stiffness in corrections during all his work. This article presents a new approach for automatic corrections of discursive questions proposing use of a virtual learning environment, named in this study as “LabSQL”. The approach is based on the use of n-grams and functions in PHP (soundex, similar_text and srt_compare) to measure the similarity between texts, with a system accuracy of 92.15%, compared to the result of a manual work. This result is higher than similar studies that reached up 82.10% of accuracy.",

The goal is to provide energy consumers with an application that displays the energy consumption/production profiles, sets up consuming ceilings, defines automatic alerts and alarms, compares anonymously consumers with identical energy usage profiles by region and predicts, in the case of non-residential installations, the expected consumption/production values. The resulting distributed system is organized in two main blocks: front-end and back-end. The front-end includes user interface applications for Android mobile devices and Web browsers. The back-end provides data storage and processing functionalities and is installed in a cloud computing platform - the Google App Engine - which provides a standard Web service interface. This option ensures interoperability, scalability and robustness to the system.",

Do these work modes can be considered collaborative work? This paper describes the results of an investigation that aimed to identify academic and research productivity of teachers, researchers and correlation with participation in various research groups, which have the characteristics of a collaborative working group. The study was conducted with a mixed research methodology, of a correlational, descriptive, transactional. The population considered was the official national register of researchers of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), attached to educational institutions and research institutes in the state of Baja California. We designed a stratified probability in which were defined in three main investigators, one for each of the cities (Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada).",

    "abstract": "Knowing energy consumption habits can contribute to efficient decision making in household environments. This work presents a decision support system, based on intelligent energy storage, which is able to manage both the electric power and the smart home devices of a house in order to optimize the local energy consumption. The architecture of this system mainly consists of two units. Firstly, the Local Energy Management Units (LEMU), which are located inside the houses and are able to maintain the electric power consumption under a threshold value and to switch on/off the devices by using the X10 protocol. Secondly, the Central Energy Management and Intelligent System (CEMIS), that receives operation data from each LEMU, analyses them using behavioral algorithms and decides the best way in which each one has to operate, smoothing the load profile and optimizing the use of the resources.",

The research aims to explore the area of safety practices associated with the use of home banking by end users, and to know the perception of the users to the security risk. Against this background and demographic variables using: (a) gender, (b) age, (c) literacy seeks to characterize the behavior of the user. Tends to be noted that the use of home banking is important for financial institutions, in that it sets up operations with reduced costs compared to traditional management of physical banks, but also has advantages from the point of view of the user, reducing the time waiting for the service and also to allow a service that is intended to be fast and efficient, anytime and anywhere.",

Understanding these motivations allows firms to set processes to explore them, in order to establish and develop a decision support social network, supported by social network sites. Participating in social networks draws upon the interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. On one hand, intrinsic factors refer to motivation embedded in the action itself (comes within the individual), rather than from external rewards such as money or recognition. On the other hand, extrinsic factors refer to the motivation coming outside the individual. Considering that solutions to problems are expected within a decision support social network, some potential problems are identified and addressed.",

    "abstract": "Assets are interrelated in risk analysis methodologies for information systems promoted by international standards. This means that an attack on one asset can be propagated through the network and threaten an organization's most valuable assets. It is necessary to valuate all assets, the direct and indirect asset dependencies, as well as the probability of threats and the resulting asset degradation. However, the experts in charge to assign such values often provide only vague and uncertain information. Fuzzy logic can be very helpful in such situation, but it is not free of some difficulties, such as the need of a proper arithmetic to the model under consideration or the establishment of appropriate similarity measures. Throughout this paper we propose a fuzzy treatment for risk analysis models promoted by international methodologies through the establishment of such elements.",

Depending on the user's task, the data retrieved may be too large to fit in the local memory. Even if it fits, the time taken to retrieve the data may compromise user interaction. This work proposes a method, TravelLight, which improves interactive traveling across very large temporal datasets by exploring the temporal consistency of data items. The proposed method consists of two algorithms: the data retrieval and the memory management algorithm, both contributing to improve memory usage and, most important, to reduce the turnaround time. Results are reported concerning experiments with a temporally linear navigation across two datasets of one million items, which differ in the average time span of items. With the obtained results it is possible to conclude that the proposed method reduces turnaround time thus enhancing the response of interactive tasks over very large temporal datasets.",

Although PACS integration with web-based technologies offer significant advantages to healthcare institutions, it is crucial that information technology based issues do not impose constraints in the medical practice workflow. Therefore, distributed PACS have to deal with performance issues in both storing and retrieving of large amounts of data across distinct systems, possibly hosted on different locations. This paper proposes an approach to reduce data transference footprint in a distributed PACS environment with DICOM-Ready applications. The proposed method provides a high level control of transference parameters, such as, number of connections, number of fragments and size of each fragment. The result was a highly tunable data stream that can be used in any distributed PACS environment.",

    "abstract": "Euclidean distance and cosine similarity are frequently used measures to implement the k-means clustering algorithm. The cosine similarity is widely used because of it's independence from document length, allowing the identification of patterns, more specifically, two documents can be seen as identical if they share the same words but have different frequencies. However, during each clustering iteration new centroids are still computed following Euclidean distance. Based on a consideration of these two measures we propose the k-Communities clustering algorithm (k-C) which changes the computing of new centroids when using cosine similarity. It begins by selecting the seeds considering a network of tags where a community detection algorithm has been implemented. Each seed is the document which has the greater degree inside its community. The experimental results found through implementing external evaluation measures show that the k-C algorithm is more effective than both the k-means and k-means++. Besides, we implemented all the external evaluation measures, using both a manual and an automatic “Ground Truth”, and the results show a great correlation which is a strong indicator that it is possible to perform tests with this kind of measures even if the dataset structure is unknown.",

    "abstract": "Many tasks dealing with temporal data, such as interactive browse through temporal datasets, require intensive retrieval from the database. Depending on the user's task, the data retrieved may be too large to fit in the local memory. Even if it fits, the time taken to retrieve the data may compromise user interaction. This work proposes a method, TravelLight, which improves interactive traveling across very large temporal datasets by exploring the temporal consistency of data items. The proposed method consists of two algorithms: the data retrieval and the memory management algorithm, both contributing to improve memory usage and, most important, to reduce the turnaround time. Results are reported concerning experiments with a temporally linear navigation across two datasets of one million items, which differ in the average time span of items. With the obtained results it is possible to conclude that the proposed method reduces turnaround time thus enhancing the response of interactive tasks over very large temporal datasets.",

Social networks web 2.0 arise as an attractive alternative to provide simple and powerful mechanisms in which users, customers, providers and other stakeholders can communicate their ideas in a natural way. In this paper an analysis is presented about the technological tools offered by social networks web 2.0 as enabler of interactions in open innovation processes. The survey begins with the detection of collaborative features of social networks. Afterwards, it follows with a list of the most representative social networks according to popularity and academic approaches. A later filter is performed to select the those to study deeply by means of a checklist. The next step eases a results analysis whose goal is to assess the interaction level allowed by each social network. Finally, a set of proposals are generated in order to support open innovation using web 2.0 approaches, among them, a new social network structure which integrates the best interaction practices identified.",

This research explores a method that allows an agent to gather information about sequences of states that lead to a goal, detect classes of common sequences and introduce the states at the end of these sequences as subgoals. We use the taxiproblem (a standard in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning literature) and conclude that, even though this problem's scale is relatively small, in most of the cases subgoals do improve the learning speed, achieving relatively good results faster than standard Q-Learning. We propose a specific iteration interval as the most appropriate to insert subgoals in the learning process. We also found that early adoption of subgoals may lead to suboptimal learning. The extension to more challenging problems is an interesting subject for future work.",

    "abstract": "In the last years, the demand for video content on the Internet had a significant growth. This growth has emerged combined with an increasing diversity of equipments capable of receiving video content and an increase in the demand for high definition content, placing new challenges of heterogeneity and scalability to the networks that should support the distribution of such contents. Traditionally the scalability problem has been solved by IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) networks using IP Multicast, supported by networks and equipments administered by private operators, with mechanisms capable of reducing the risks associated with flows that do not respond to congestion. However, on the Internet, such risks have resulted in the lack of implementation of IP Multicast, which in turn affects large-scale distributions of video. This has caused content providers to use so-called Application layer or overlay solutions. In this context, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solutions are currently extensively used for file exchange, making them a natural solution to the point to multipoint distribution of video. Regarding the problem of terminal heterogeneity, the introduction of standards for scalable video compression, allows the distribution of several qualities, targeting a range of equipment terminals with different resolutions and processing capabilities. In this field, this paper evaluates the effect of several P2P parameters associated with the BitTorrent P2P file-sharing protocol for the distribution of H.264 scalable video creating a point-multipoint real-time distribution system capable of delivering the same content to a high number of heterogeneous terminals.",

We find substantial inter-reviewer agreement, partly explainable through persuasive convergence and anchoring effects. Final article acceptance through juried selection is strongly correlated with the average grade in open review, while the number of article reviews is less consequential for selection. The communication design of AltCHI open review balances several conflicting participation incentives, in order to support juried selection for atypical and potentially controversial papers.",

This is why institutions globally have shown a strong interest in the development of models for operational risk management. However, these have come with some limitations, due to the fact that the variables that comprise this type of risk are highly discrete and qualitative with respect to the frequency and severity that characterize a risk event. Thus, in this article a risk measurement model that is based on Fuzzy Petri Nets will be developed and analyzed, which models each of the seven risk events according to the definitions of the Basel II framework. This way each risk event is modeled through a combination of frequency and severity distributions, and finally the capital at risk (CaR) can be estimated. The results that were obtained by applying the Petri nets model showed a good performance with respect to its capability of integrating the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of operational risk, where the knowledge for obtaining the CaR is given by inference rules that can be generated by an experto.",

    "abstract": "The increased access of information enables a greater awareness of people with environmental and social problems, which leads to perform daily activities with less effort that requires a greater demand on the condition of the pedestrian locomotion. Planning, engineering, operation, maintenance and development of the public places are critical elements in the improvement of the people locomotion. Therefore, the detailed study of the pedestrian flow is required. The cognitive multi-agent simulation with the cellular automata is an excellent technique in the analysis of flow and the pedestrian behaviors. Thus, it is possible to model and understand the processes related to the social interactions. For example, coordination, cooperation, formation by collisions and groups, evolution of conventions, intentionality, free will, among others.",

Data privacy is thus the main focus of this paper, with particular emphasis on contexts of interoperability between systems. The goal is to provide an approach to the study of this issue by selecting the interoperability model that best suits this approach and use it to identify and study the main factors that affect data privacy.

In today's organizations, Data Warehousing (DW) have offered support to business management and become part of natural and logical evolution for any decision support systems. In this scenario, DW solutions deployments have failed due to poor data quality implementations. Although some research has been devoted to investigating these problems, none has performed complete and thoroughly focused on examining quality issues manifests in its core component, i.e., the DW repository. This article presents a taxonomy for data quality issues, in the context of multidimensional data models, characteristic of DW. Finally, this work demonstrates that the proposed Taxonomy provides a more appropriate coverage to the problems of data quality and proposes its use in future works for quality measurements.",

This study sought to correlate these standards to evaluate the maturity of processes and controls of information access control in an organization. A survey applied to organization analysts was added to this methodology and showed a low degree of maturity of these controls and mapped the need to develop basic standards as an Information Security Policy and operational standards, as a way to reduce the uncontrolled and inappropriate use of IT resources of the organization.

    "abstract": "In p2p marketplaces, users often have to decide if someone is trustworthy or not. Sometimes, this decision is based purely on faith, which is something not everyone is willing to do. For this reason, trust has been identified as one of the key factors for the success of the sharing economy. Over the years trust mechanisms have been developed on a per site basis (i.e. feedback, voting or reputation systems) and users have been slowly building trust in these sites and leaving a reputation trail as they move from site to site. This process should be more efficient and users must be able to use the hard earned reputation to show they are trustworthy. To this end, we present a trust model for improving trust between users, normally in the context of p2p transactions, based on online credibility sources and social network quality metrics. In this paper we formally define a multi-dimensional trust model adapted to p2p marketplaces, introduce WhyTrusted.com prototype as a proof-of-concept that is able to capture, process, and translate data into relevant dimensions of the trust model to measure a person's perceived trustworthiness with a portable, cross-platform trust score, and use an empirical analysis to confirm that the WhyTrusted trust score and source ratings improve a user's propensity to trust.",

To evaluate the power of ultrasounds to help in the lesions diagnosis, first some phantoms were developed trying mimicking the human skin tissue. Thus, several gelatin-based phantoms have been constructed with scattering agents as flour, starch and glass microspheres. Then, A-Scan lines were extracted using the pulse echo approach, followed by the ultrasound velocity. The obtained results for the considered acoustical parameter present good concordance with the ones found in literature. Methodologies were developed to analyze the using phantoms and human images with and without lesions. Two approaches were considered: (1) the identification of the superficial skin boundary working as a skin lesion discriminator, (2) and binary classification, characterizing the presence/absence of lesions, using several regions of interest by the Support Vector Machine and the Naive Bayes classifiers.",

The automatic creation of timetables for Education is one of the most studied problems by the scientific community.

The CBR agent approach that combines agent autonomy with the problem solving model of CBR has been adequate for the development of complex systems. This paper proposes the architecture of a RBC agent whose main differential is the use of ontologies for representing the base case along with all the mechanisms that make up a CBR system. The proposed architecture besides promoting the reuse of the case ontology, unifies the software agent approach with CBR, a typical paradigm of human reasoning. All the CBR mechanisms are present in the proposed architecture: case representation, similarity analysis for cases retrieval, adaptation and cases learning, where the last two mechanisms are still being specified.",

    "abstract": "Elders lose independence and wellbeing, accompanied by decreased functions in terms of hearing, vision, strength and coordination abilities. These factors contribute to balance difficulties that eventually lead to falls. The injuries due to falls, at this age, are risky, since most of the times may cause a significant - and permanent - decrease of quality of life or, in extreme cases, death. In this context, a fall detection system can bring an added value to assist elderly people. This paper describes a system consisting of a wearable sensor unit, a smartphone and a website. When the sensor detects a fall it sends an alert using the smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0, to notify the family members or stakeholders. The sensor device includes an inertial unit, a barometer, and a temperature and humidity sensor. The website displays the log of previous falls and enables the configuration of emergency contact numbers. The proposed fall detection system is one of multiple components within a larger project under development that offers a holistic perspective on falls; the complete wearable solution will also feature, among others, physical protection (minimizing the impact of falls that occur).",

Such model has been implemented and evaluated, being composed of two representations and facilities specially oriented to two important actors in LMS development. These actors are the author and the developer, where a concept map is offered to the first one in order to help authors to select services that will compose the intended LMS. The flexible reference architecture is dedicated to the software developers in order to help them to implement the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based recommender system to automatically approximate these two representations through rules that map the needs of the author in design decisions to developers. Hence, the system may recommend a new architecture for customized LMS or even an existing LMS to the author. The proposed system has been evaluated in the task of constructing a specific LMS thus showing positive results.",

Based on the Technology-Organizational-Environment (TOE) framework, the present study develops a research model to measure and examine determinants of ERP Use in regards to the impact on Iberian Manufacturing Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Hypotheses are postulated based on five determinants (Training, Compatibility, Firm size, Best-practices and Competitive pressure). Testing was conducted through structural equation modeling, utilizing data from 158 web-surveyed firms in Portugal and Spain of the Manufacturing sector. Results showed that all determinants contribute to explain “ERP Use” except Training. The paper provides insight on which determinants contribute for ERP use in Manufacturing Iberian SMEs, offering managerial and academic implications.",

There are few reviews in the literature about the post-adoption phase and even fewer at SME level. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge there is none with focus in ERP value stage. This review will fill this gap. It provides an updated bibliography of ERP publications published in the IS journal and conferences during the period of 2000 and 2012. A total of 33 articles from 21 journals and 12 conferences are reviewed. The main focus of this paper is to shed the light on the areas that lack sufficient research within the ERP in SME domain, in particular in ERP business value stage, suggest future research avenues, as well as, present the current research findings that could support researchers and practitioners when embarking on ERP projects.",

Despite its enormous importance in the implementation and success of a data warehouse, there is still no convincing approach to ETL modeling, able to support the various stages of its development and subsequent implementation. That is, an approach that allows their characterization to a more abstract level and later provides its direct mapping in execution primitives. In this paper we propose an approach for modeling and implementing ETL processes based on meta-models (patterns), which represents standard tasks typically used in most real-world ETL systems. For that, we intend to use a series of new BPMN (Business Process Model Notation) constructs, which enables the modeling and validation of such processes, before conducting to its final implementation.",

This massive appearance of mobile devices creates significant opportunities to leverage these mobile devices to establish novel types of services. However there are also significant concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive data exchanged and stored on these devices. Since these devices are usually embodied with numerous characteristics like camera devices, 3G and NFC connection that can be used to create new alternative authentication schemes in order to guarantee users identity.

The need to combine the availability of the information with portability has been fostering the evolution of technological devices, while producing some paradigm shifts. Mobile computing, in particular, is an area increasingly put to use and recognized as necessary in terms of adding value to an information society, namely through smartphones. At the same time, Augmented Reality (AR) - or the act of superimposing virtual elements to the image captured in real time - has been taking advantage of the rapid evolution in terms of the smartphones' processing capabilities. The ISEGI-NOVA AR Project, presented in this work, consists in developing and deploying an Augmented Reality system to assure a multitude of services, directed to the smartphone medium. These services, making use of existing AR third party technologies, allow users to interact with multimedia layers (images, sounds, video, web content, animations) superimposed to the image captured by the smartphone camera. Besides the ability to provide Augmented Reality contents, the ISEGI-NOVA AR Project's scope includes the development of a web-based platform that allows dynamic Augmented Reality experiences creation, through graphical user interfaces.",

This paper presents a method for directing the efforts of software process improvement in SMEs. To achieve this, we have adapted the main activities of Goal Question Metric (GQM). Besides, it presents the experience of applying the proposed method to lead the effort to implement improvements in an SME.",

By using the NING platform, we built an online social network that was streamlined for eight months with 45 participants. We achieved many of our original goals while using design-based research and various techniques of collecting and analysing data. The results show that the creation of an informal learning context, which allowed for sharing experiences and building knowledge, was rated very positively by participants. It involved a plural reality with different participation levels: the more active members adopted more \"critical\" and \"creative\" positions while the more passive ones took on the position of \"collector\", \"spectator\" and of someone who was more \"inactive\". We conclude that the potential of Social Software is enabled by the use it is given by the participants and that it is an effective means of overcoming the isolation felt by parents and teachers of children and young people with multiple disabilities.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, due to the emergence of social networks, the interaction between customers and companies has experienced major changes. This change, like others, has advantages but also disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages which arose from this modification is the fact that, currently, organizations have lost control over what customers say about them, since they can easily publish their negative opinions and spread them rapidly. However, some organizations have quickly realized this situation could promote important competitive advantages, through the analysis of what customers say about them in different communication channels. Besides that, the increasing use of internet allowed that a lot of information is available online and an example of it is that, nowadays, the majority of newspapers make their publications daily available, on their websites, on the internet. Therefore, the data volume daily available on the internet grows exponentially and all of the information produced through this data might be important, if treated and used correctly. That is how the challenge of creating knowledge through this information in an automated way, emerges. Thus, the goal of this project is to build a model able to evaluate the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) of economic news headlines, available on RSS Feeds addresses. In order to do that, software SAS was used and, consequently its methodology, whose detailed description is also a goal. In this way, section I introduces the subject for a better contextualization. Section II presents the goals for the project which originated this paper, followed by the state of art in the section III. The section IV portrays the methodology to Knowledge Discovery in Text as well as the methodology used in the creation of Sentiment Analysis model. The section V refers the results achieved with the implementation of this project and, for last, the conclusions are presented in the section VI.",

The needs of such organizations worldwide are particular and are far from the needs of large organizations. Large organizations are capable of supporting and implementing large and complex structures of international standards and models for software process improvement. The provision of facilities to small and medium sized organizations to implement best practices in software development based on the recommendations of the international standards and models is: a) a need for these organizations, b) a duty of both industry and academia. Therefore, it is necessary to make a diagnosis to identify the needs of these organizations in the area of best practices in software development. The goal of this paper is to analyze the current state of the implementation of best practices in software development in small and medium organizations. To achieve this goal, a survey was designed. Then it was applied to a representative region of Colombia (Medellín). In this paper we present the analysis of the collected statistical results, allowing a pilot study given the target population (Latin America).",

The fires that devastate every year several areas in Portugal, as well as in Europe and all over the world require new skills in order to operate on the ground, but the acquisition of skills necessary to perform their functions, requires multiple skills. However the training required to carry out their missions, rarely is compatible with the time management and the professional activities of each fireman, because most of them are volunteer. The article proposes a better knowledge about their training needs, how they would like to organize their activities and updating of knowledge, given the disparities between geographical and reconciling their professions and fire service in volunteers. However, the heterogeneity in this occupational group in terms of age, level of education, digital literacy, raises questions about the use of digital learning resources, as well as perceptions have on distance learning.

For that we propose a local energy broker, responsible to handle local energy flow and to exchange energy with ‘big’ market players, and based on a collaborative approach, to promote user's participation to increase systems knowledge.

Within this scope, an empirical study based on quiz enquiry has been made to 184 companies in Aveiro's district. The focus centered on the following key questions: (1) level of use of the online communication tools, (2) type of management of the social networks' websites, and (3) perception of the contributions given to the relationship with customers. Results show that companies are aware of this new reality of social networks as a way of spreading and communicating, but, on the other hand, they do not see it as a tool to manage and boost client's relationship.",

The demand for Graphical user interface (GUI) testing has very much increased in the last years. An important progress in this field has been achieved, from GUI manual testing to complete automate GUI testing. In this paper, optimization theory and evolutionary algorithms (EA) concepts were applied for GUI testing. In our approach, the GUI is completely separated from the code itself. The aim of the proposed methodology is to find the test case sequence(s) which produce(s) the maximum amount of changes inside the GUI while preserving all other constraints. The method starts by randomly generating the initial set of test cases, which is then improved through measuring and evaluating specific fitness functions. By using optimization theory, very good results were obtained for accelerating the automatic test of large interfaces.",

This information can also be very useful for professionals, researchers and students in this field. But the usual word-based search does not allow full exploration of the information, pointing to the need for more semantic approaches. Aiming to contribute to providing a semantic search for information on Health, available using written Portuguese, the article presents enhanced search platform architecture based on the enterprise search platform (FAST), providing a processing pipeline capable of exploring annotation of entities and relations defined in a domain. A modular architecture was defined in which an ontology-based knowledge base has an essential role. As it is essential to make the user task as simple as possible, the platform also includes ontology navigation in the classes and relations of the entity to guide queries; use of the most frequent domain classes in the documents relating to a search to provide additional ways of navigation; and inclusion in the score of the ontology-guided annotations. As a first proof of concept, the architecture was instantiated in a specific domain, neurological diseases, for which an ontology was created.",

The new method of analysis proposed is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques (using Bipolar Laddering - BLA) to assess the use of augmented reality systems applied to university teaching. The novel combination of methods and usability studies is meant to focus on the opinion and perception of the student. With this evaluation, the teacher can modify and improve the methods of deploying technology in the university framework in order to achieve a collaborative environment of success instead of the more traditional lecture environment. The positive results from a first teaching experience where the proposed method has been used, which we present in the current paper, confirm the utility of the method and encourage further replications for standardization.",

Although there are several applications for operationalizing the resolution of contradictions, it appears that there is a lack of current methodologies that address how to manage the contradictions and how they can assist the transformation of organization. In this context, this proposal appears based on an analytical model for analysis of the contradictions in the implementation of an organization. The model provides the basis for the resolution of the contradictions in the ontological model. As a means of validating the proposal, its application was carried out in a case study of an organization that specializes in information security.",

Having reliable and valid instruments to measure variables is an essential condition for the credibility of a research. Thus, we developed a study to determine the psychometric characteristics of this questionnaire applied to a sample of Portuguese teachers. Based on this study, other professionals may apply this instrument safely. It should be noted that the validation of a measure instrument for the social sciences is an ongoing process. In other words, validation is always needed when applying the instruments on new samples.

Documentation is a major step towards heritage preservation, whether threatened by man-made or natural factors but no architectural database or measurement records exist due to the absence of specialists and experts. Thus, there is an immediate need for training new technicians and architects who could ensure documentation and conservation of remaining heritage. Thus, we propose a combination of new technologies, flexible, high interconnectivity, and high usability data formats to capture, model, and simulate these elements of heritage interest. For this purpose, an academic experiment involving architecture students from Jeddah was designed. The experiment required students to engage with a new integration of ICT-Hybrid technologies that incorporate dynamic and fast processes for 3D documentation and modeling. In this paper, we evaluate the usability of the proposed methodology as well as investigate ideas that may bring us closer to the goal of effective heritage documentation.",

These IT systems are normally able to handle huge amounts of digital data and to extract relevant fingerprints useful to improve the quality of clinical practice. However, they provide multiple and heterogeneous databases and informational environments, namely regarding to the information stored in Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). The heterogeneous of environments make the access to the information a challenge to extract relevant data. This paper presents the deployment and validation process of the Dicoogle system in two health care facilities. This system represents a new approach able to collect and index information from distinct PACS archives, developed on top of Dicoogle, which allow the construction of multiple views over data repositories according to the standard Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM), in a flexible and fast way. The developed methodology can contribute to improve the use of DICOM metadata, stored over disperse PACS of radiology departments, which otherwise not be used in productivity, efficiency and quality initiatives at radiology departments.",

The contour lines are generalized using a tension parameter locally adapted to a selection set of line characteristics. The proposed methodology determines the tension to be applied to the curve in function of the contour line characteristics (fractal dimension, the length and others). A test is performed over a 1:25k scale map.

It has an enormous potential and capability to improve business processes and technological innovations for companies. This paper seeks to investigate the factors that affect the adoption of ISO by comparing the effect across two business areas: human resources and finance. Based on the combination of a technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, we develop a conceptual model to study the determinants of ISO by both business areas. Data collected from 261 firms were used to test the proposed model. The study found top management support, perceived benefits, complexity, and competitive pressure to be determinants of ISO adoption in both business areas. Relative advantage was also found influential for finance. Furthermore, attitude toward change was found to have negative effects for both business areas.",

A total of 245 drugs and their absorption experimentally determined values were arranged into various data sets to perform training and validation of the different implemented neural networks. Logarithms of the maximum steady-state flux (log J) values were correlated with four input variables; i) Count fo H-Acceptor Sites (CHA), ii) H-Donors Charged Surface Area (HDCA), iii) Gravitational index (Gb) and iv) Weighted Positive Charged Partial Surface Area (WPSA-2). Besides these, other neural networks were implemented with an extra input variable, which measuring the similarity of the different drugs (Distance). All developed neural networks present a high squared correlation coefficient with a low root-mean-square error, and they improve the MLR prediction model in 24%.",

It is a building component exposed to degradation agents such as the use of housing, requiring a regular evaluation of its conservation status. The implemented model supports periodic inspections to the local and monitoring the maintenance of interior walls using Virtual Reality (VR) technology. On an inspection visit, the application allows to query a database formed by anomalies, usually associated with the coat of paint, the most probable causes and recommended repair methodologies. Additionally, the VR application accepts the assignment to each coating element monitored, a chromatic scale related to the degree of degradation, set according to the period of time between the dates of painting and repainting. The use of VR technology allows engineers to carry out inspections and evaluate the degree of wear of materials in a direct and very intuitive. The VR application constitutes a positive contribution in the field of construction, towards the use of it as an innovative technology with viewing and interaction capacities.",

This laboratory has been proven with several groups of students during the last three years. This experience showed the need of a tool designed to let students agree among them. It was a demand from practices where the work implied big teams, and making decisions without seeing each other was a rising problem. Therefore a novel tool has been developed. This tool works like a forum, with the ability of voting. Thus, students can insert proposals and vote them while making decisions in a simple way. In addition, the proposals can be organized in an intuitive structure, without the intervention of moderators. This paper describes this new utility, the fields where it is used and some empiric results from the experience.",

OpenGnSys operations, performed in an easy and intuitive way from a graphical console with remote functions, are managed by a high availability cluster. Its implementation provides a dual backup function of both hardware infrastructure and classroom operating services. In addition to lab management, we propose a quality control procedure by site acceptance tests. These tests stand for a standard methodology for determining the compliance degree according to classroom operation and specifications. As a result, this methodology has reduced the effort in classroom administration and operation.",

This work is part of the project Manual Digital II (MD II). The project is financed by Quadro de Referência Estratégico Nacional (QREN), with contract number 2010/013 657, developed under Sistema de Incentivos à Investigação e Desenvolvimento Tecnológico (SI&DT). It develops in the context of a joint venture between the company Lusoinfo Multimédia and Instituto de Educação da Universidade do Minho. Its main recipients are educators and teachers of primary schools, children and parents. The project aims to produce digital educational contents, based on innovative processes of designing, production and application. In this article, we had the objective to contribute to the knowledge of the reality of the use of MDII in the formal context of a classroom, to recognize teaching strategies adopted by a teacher and to identify major barriers to the effective use of these contents. The present study, in the form of a case study, took place during the months of April, May and June 2012 about a fourth grade class of an elementary school. Results show that the educational games in the classroom can be, in fact, features drivers of new strategies for teaching and learning. However, their use alone does not determine a most successful learning process, so it is important to understand the limitations on the effective use of these digital means. We identified one of these limitations: teacher training in the area of Information Technology and Communication (ICT) for development of digital skills, methodological and educative. We understand that this is a crucial factor that can make a difference later to a more effective use of these new educational resources.",

Has increasingly been focusing on the training of competent readers and implementation of new ways of reading. At the same time, has been witnessing to a major expansion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in schools Portuguese, given the importance they have for life in society. In this sense, this research aims to understand to what extent the performance of reading tasks, using books in electronic form, contribute to increased student motivation for reading. To support the research used a qualitative methodology (research-action), based on the implementation of learning tasks. As main sources of data collection for this research was chosen questionnaire survey, by observation/assessment of reading and the notes field. This research was developed under the stage of Practice Supervised performed in a school of the 1st cycle of basic education in the municipality of Castelo Branco with a group of twenty-five students attending the second grade in school year 2011/2012. Data analysis showed that students possess skills in the use of the computer and use it often alone activities in addition to their learning and play activities. The comparison between the initial reading and evaluation that was carried out after the implementation of the tasks with the use of digital resources (digital books using electronic presentation software) showed that there was a significant evolution of the performance of students in the reading in particular, some students whose reading assessment was initially negative.",

In this work, we present a framework to semi-automatically generate user stories to measure UX. Our character-centric approach consists of multiple agents that pursue goals and are able to express emotions. Additionally, we introduce a supportive agent that is in charge of generating a strong story line. The framework allows for further extension with avatars that give form to the character agents, and also story generation output in the form of video or comics that complement the current text generation.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to a wide variety of threats and node replication attack is of the most critical concern. In node replication attack, an adversary creates many replicas after compromising and obtaining all the secret credentials of the captured node. These replicas are deployed by an adversary at strategic positions of the network in order to launch many insidious attacks within the sensor network. Node replication attack becomes more sophisticated and harmful when it appears in the form of masked replication attack. In masked replication attack all the neighbors of a clone node are compromised so that an adversary is able to shelter its clone node from being detected by the detection process. To counter node replication attack many witness based techniques have been proposed but almost of them are unable to detect masked replication attack. Some of the existing witness based techniques proposed for the node replication attack have promising results for countering node replication attack but not a single one of them have provided a solution for masked replication attack which is a specialized type of node replication attack.",

Despite the improvement on safety measures, many occupants and employers in this type of buildings still lack adequate knowledge and training on how to behave in such hazardous situations. EVA is presented as a possible solution, which is based on the concept of Serious Games that can be used as a training tool by safety professionals.

However, the production of contents for such games, namely game scenarios with virtual worlds composed by cities and related elements (streets, buildings, furniture and so on) may require a laborious effort by multidisciplinary teams which lead to an expensive and time consuming solution. In order to avoid the development burden, procedural modeling techniques have been created and applied to generate virtual models of buildings and cities expeditiously with high degree of detail and realism. Nevertheless, most of the existing techniques use complex sets of rules to produce models without being aware of the architectonic structures and its relationships. Thereby, in order to simplify the generation process and rule dealing we propose, in this paper, an ontology-based procedural modeling methodology which integrates an ontological structure, describing city elements and the relationships between each other, and a combined set of procedural techniques to generate roman houses. The preliminary results point to a method capable of producing roman houses expeditiously, including the interiors and the exteriors.",

There is a lot of applications, particularly in the context of serious games and in particular those dealing with education, that internally represents information or concepts in a graph-like structure and that could benefit from the appealing look of augmented reality. The herein described library greatly simplifies the development of these applications by encapsulating operations management of the graph and taking care of the main challenges from the aspect of augmented reality.

The developed application provides two modules of augmented reality, one based on GPS coordinates provided by the current smartphones, the other in the extraction of additional information of treasure. This extraction uses two-dimensional quick response codes (QR Code), to serve two purposes; provide additional information to the treasure hunt be used as a augmented reality marker.

This methodological change was made defeating, in many cases, resistance to change made by both teachers and students. New problems have also appeared from the constant regulatory changes. In this paper we address the three main issues that, in our view, affect the teaching of mathematics in the various Spanish engineering schools. The proposed solution passes through a targeted increase in teaching cooperation and design of new mechanisms for evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Argumentation and trust models have been increasingly used in multi-agent systems research, with applications in several domains such as e-commerce. Negotiation is a form of interaction in which argumentation and trust can play a relevant role. Argumentation in a negotiation context has been defined as a way of interaction between trading parties that enables them to exchange information in order to explain their current position with the intention of increasing the chance of success. We propose an argumentation model based on past contractual data aiming at enriching electronic contracting processes. The idea behind this argumentation model is to prevent failures in future agreements. For that, an important step is to define a reasoning model that allows trading parties to point out some past contractual failures or explain such past failures. The purpose of this paper is then to investigate on how argumentation-based negotiation using historical contractual data may affect the outcome of a contracting process, taken as a comprehensive activity ranging from negotiation, monitoring and enactment assessment. This may be achieved through a careful selection of the partner with whom a contract is to be established, complemented with an argumentation-based negotiation of contract terms.",

This paper presents a high-level overview of an architecture applicable for small-scale vehicles in autonomous driving competitions. A special emphasis is given on the sensory and navigation sub-systems since they are the most prominent intelligent decision layers. The former is almost entirely based on computer vision, processing the raw image content from two ordinary and inexpensive “web-cams”, conveying further relevant information to the later, on a real-time basis. The proposed architecture was implemented with minimal interventions to an Ackermann-like vehicle which was originally designed for recreational purposes, serving as a “proof of concept” of the developed system. Results show that a low-cost, scalable and modular system can be easily integrated on regular small-scale vehicles obtaining exciting results at a minimal cost.",

Thus we have constituted an image database that simulates the CNDP and then apply the model. We used a total of 500 pictures and 10 hours of video.

    "abstract": "Serious Games are increasingly used as a tool for various applications contrary to the traditional entertainment purpose. Many game engines are available, and Unity3D is another example that presents some features such as rapid prototyping and an easy learning curve. The 3D space where action takes place is sometimes hard to map into a logical memory structure providing flexible access to that information. The problem of tracking players' path as well as their decisions in 3D environments arises when there is no previous knowledge of the scenario representation and the creation of a memory data structure poses an extra effort for the modeller. The proposed solution in this paper, albeit simple, is a straightforward way to track the location of the video game character and map it when he/she passes certain limits. This mechanism proved to represent a key step forward, addressing the important issue of tracking the decision-making process of players for future analysis and behaviour elicitation.",

A way of addressing this issue is to model opponents' behavior in order to estimate their game plan and make decisions based on such estimations. In this paper, several hand evaluation and classification techniques are compared and conclusions on their respective applicability and scope are drawn. Also, we suggest improvements on current techniques through Monte Carlo sampling. The current methods to deal with risk management were found to be pertinent concerning the agent's decision-making process; nevertheless future integration of these methods with opponent modeling techniques can greatly improve overall Poker agents' performance.",
