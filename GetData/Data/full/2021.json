    "abstract": "Undoubtedly, the online market has grown exponentially over the last decade, allowing several activities that were carried out in person to be carried out virtually. Has technology reached the point of perfection, when it comes to replicating face-to-face activities? This article focuses on the analysis of factors that may influence the experience of playing in physical casinos vs. betting on online casinos. The goal is to understand the extent to which technology was able to reproduce this activity and concerning which points does it fail. We also assess which of the two activities players feel most comfortable with, where they spend more money, where they feel like betting more often, among others. To this end, we performed an analysis of articles, a survey (with 100 responses), and seven interviews with regular casino gamblers, which allowed conclusions to be drawn on the theme. Chi-square tests were performed on the survey data, but no statistically significant associations were found. The results of our survey show a slight increase in the need to gamble due to the pandemic, which is in line with previous research. Despite the accessibility of online games, there are factors that lag behind, such as the fact that people have more fun in physical casinos. However, online casinos make people bet more money because they are not so aware of the money they are spending and because they are in the comfort of their home, away from negative looks.",

    "abstract": "Lightweight virtualization, and specifically containers, has become widespread in the information technology industry to provide an efficient operational environment for the execution of scalable services on the Internet. Containers rely on a set of technologies different from the features that enable hardware virtualization (i.e., hypervisor-based virtual machines). However, both types of virtualized environments are employed to host applications that will be accessible anytime, anywhere. Thus, they are prone to software aging, which usually affects systems that run for long time intervals. Researchers have identified software aging effects in distinct types of cloud computing environments and hypervisors over recent years. However, a few works have dealt with this phenomenon in container-based platforms. This paper presents an experimental analysis of the software aging effects observed on Docker platforms while also evaluating a time- series model's fitness to predict resource consumption's progress caused by software aging. We employ a stress test workload tailored for the scenario of containers arranged in a cluster managed by Docker Swarm. The obtained results indicate an increasing usage of resident memory, virtual memory, and CPU usage, as the system undergoes subsequent scale-up and scale-down operations. The quadratic trend model was the best fitting approach for predicting resident and virtual memory usage, with less than 5% of prediction error. The experimental approach presented here may help systems administrators detect evidence of software aging in container- based environments, allowing them to choose a proper method and time for deploying rejuvenation actions to mitigate the dependability issues raised in similar scenarios described here.",

It is used in organizations, public and private, to compile and process data, as well as perform extraction, cleaning, optimization and unification of various sources and loads of data in a Data Warehouse. BI makes it possible to achieve more accurate results, using a multidimensional database, oriented by subject, non-volatile, historical, decision-making and variable in relation to time. The ETL process proved to be an effective tool in the management of retired employees of a Federal Educational Institution, since it enabled the development of a base of indicators, through the BI, quantitative, qualitative and geographic tools of these employees. With the unification of the various databases, it was possible to identify the spatial location of the servers, allowing faster contact, their concentration by age group, the level and intensity of the links between the parties, as well as the evolution of health-related issues, evolution of retirement, mainly in legal matters. Thus, this article describes the ETL process designed to extract information about retired employees from different data sources and the creation of a Data Warehouse capable of providing individual and group information about these retired employees.",

In part, this happens because the self-taught or enthusiastic musician usually focuses only on the practical part of the music, wishing to be able to play a particular song only by memorizing the chords and notes necessary for that specific situation, without worrying about the theoretical part behind the music. In addition, some methods adopted in schools and even music colleges are out of date, being far from the student's expectations. This work aims to use technology to assist the study of music theory with the creation of an interactive and didactic system, consisting of a musical computational artifact named GuitarEasy, in which students of all levels will be able to visualize the theoretical aspects easily.",

In the light of literature, one of the tools with the greatest promotion potential is digital marketing, since it allows reaching new and larger target audiences more efficiently and effectively. Realizing the lack of a conceptual and functional vision capable of guiding the planning and execution of digital marketing initiatives in the context of rural tourism, this article proposes a conceptual model focused on characterizing the potential impact that digital marketing initiatives can generate, namely in terms of the development of a positive image of the rural tourism destination and of the influence on the tourists' decision to visit.",

Here, we aimed to analyze how the brief presentation (34 ms) of emojis congruent with the emotional content of sentences designed to represent the five basic emotions, and neutral situations, relative to their verbal equivalents or the absence of any stimulus as control, affects the processing of the emotional content of these sentences using an affective appraisal task combined with the masked priming paradigm. Results showed that, although the use of emojis did not appear to affect the level of arousal elicited by the sentences, they did impact the speed with which these responses were made, though only in sentences associated with the emotions of sadness and disgust. Specifically, in these sentences, the prior presentation of the emoji produced longer responses when compared to the control stimulus. These results suggest that the use of emojis does not seem to offer advantages in the emotional processing of written messages, at least at early stages of processing.",

In this way the results suggest that sales growth can be understood as a variable that interests a greater number of company stakeholders, both internal and external. When using ROA as a dependent variable, the results suggest that as this is a management variable, the manager tends to be concerned with maintaining adequate levels of economic profitability ensuring sustainability and future solvency.",

Hence, this work introduces an information system that allows maintaining the data of patients and their entire treatment, from therapies adopted to patient's evolution. The system was evaluated in the development environment to show its feasibility in a few scenarios. The next step is to apply appropriate data analysis techniques to support a more personalized treatment.",

The aim of this paper is to examine the view of tourism supply agents (TSA) on the development of an information system for accessible tourism. To achieve this aim, a questionnaire to a sample of Portuguese TSA was administered to identify the type of data that these users are interested in introducing in the system and the information that they desire to obtain from it. Results show that TSA considered the creation of an accessible tourism information system important and also showed interested in being part of it. Regarding the information to insert and retrieve from the tourism information system, TSA showed interest in aspects related to the accessibility of tourism offers, as well as information related to the characteristics of the accessible tourism market.",

    "abstract": "Emotions play an essential role in human behavior. It can be expressed in body language, facial expression, hand gesture, text, and many other ways. While recognizing emotions in human-human interaction is important, some individuals lack this ability. This is the case for individuals who have specific disabilities, for example, people diagnosed with autism, who may suffer from the inability to recognize emotions on faces, text, and figures. Some studies concentrate on developing approaches to assist individuals with this disability. In this regard, one can mention the studies dedicated to creating emotional agents to help in the recognition of emotions. However, there is a gap in studies that focus on the Portuguese language. This article presents an approach to bridge this gap by creating an emotional agent capable of processing voice and text in Portuguese. According to the sentiment present in words, the agent exhibits the emotions Joy, Sadness, and Neutral in a light-emitting diode matrix. Initial experiments indicate that it is possible to display these emotions based on the words' sentiments.",

Objectively measuring applications is an important concern from the perspective of improving the engineering approach to software development. This goal is related to improving estimates of the effort required to develop an application, but also to measure existing products. Currently, there are already several variations of software measurement metrics. Despite this, they cannot be classified as better or worse, since they have different purposes and respond according to what is intended to be measured. This article aims to propose a metric to measure the functional size of Web Applications (Web Points). For this purpose, a study was made in the literature on Software Engineering and existing metrics. The metric was then proposed and applied to Web applications developed in academic environment.",

These devices have the potential to be applied in several fields of study. In this paper, we investigate the application of a low-cost electroencephalography device in the context of the treatment of aphasia, a neurological condition that compromises the ability to communicate. Specifically, we aim to aid rehabilitation programs, allowing continual and online monitoring of the working memory capacity of aphasic patients. Evidence suggests that the main cause of difficulties in communication within aphasia lie in the deterioration of the ability to store and process data in the short term. We propose an analysis technique based on Event-Related Potentials and inferential statistics to provide a general score of working memory capacity. Preliminary results indicate that a low-cost, portable and wireless electroencephalography device is able to properly capture brain signals, which are then made available to a station that is responsible for analyzing and displaying the processed information to the rehabilitation professional.",

Information from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru was used to expose this relationship. For the first model, the results showed that both the expressions of TICs and Foreign Direct Investment in the short term have detrimental effects on CO2 emissions, however in the long term, these emissions would begin to decrease, fulfilling the inverted U of Kuznets. in the case of TICs exportations, but not for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as the coefficient was not significant. For the second Model, the use of the internet in the short term would have a negative effect on the recovery of the forest, increasing its use, but in the long term, there would be a recovery of the forest. In the same way, for the GDP per capita, in the short term, there would be a positive effect for the recovery of the forest, but in the long term, there would be a deterioration. As a recommendation, the importance of the production of high-tech products is highlighted, since they reduce pollution in the short or long term.",

To demonstrate the existing relationship, panel data from 12 Latin American countries were used, disaggregated into 3 groups of 4 countries according to their income, (According to the Atlas method of the World Bank) that is, high-income countries (Chile, Panama, Uruguay, Mexico), middle-income (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador) and low-income (Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua). The results reflected that the technology variable positively influences the HDI in low- and middle-income countries, corroborating the theory, the effect being greater in the countries of the latter group. However, high-income countries show a negative relationship between technology and the HDI. As a Policy recommendation, governments should be concerned with the Promotion of human capital and opportunities for access to technology individually, to improve the quality of life.",

The combination of these approaches helps to better understand the future alternatives available to decision-makers by combining storytelling with trend extrapolation using a proposed new hybrid process called FLighTS (Future Lighthouse Trending Scenarios). Thus, in the process of determining the most appropriate future, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to vague and ambiguous value judgments in the process of inference of decision makers.The work presented in this article aims to improve the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to facilitate further exploration of the possibilities of a new non-linear way of thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental example that develops a case for a higher education institution (HEI).The article ends with a reflection on conceptual modeling and suggests ways for use in future research.",

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which the information displayed on the electronic portals of local Portuguese deliberative bodies contributes to the exercise of democratic accountability. Using mixed methods, with the first qualitative and second quantitative phase, and with content analysis techniques this study presents an index capable of measuring the level of democratic accountability in the electronic portals of the local Portuguese deliberative bodies, reveals that although there is accountability, there is a significant absence of democratic mechanisms in the implementation of these virtual environments.",

The present work is aimed to develop a multimodal deep learning model that is able to produce a prediction map of the health of crops. The model takes multispectral images and field sensor data (humidity, temperature, soil status, etc.) as an input and creates a yield map of a crop. The utilization of multimodal data is aimed to extract hidden patterns in the status of crops and in this way obtain better results than the use of vegetation indices.",

This context gave rise to NoSQL database technologies, with MongoDB as one of its prominent representatives. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of MongoDB in its cluster architecture against the standalone mode, with massive data from the National High School Exam (Enem), in addition to performing a brief interpretation of the results from the perspective of the educational domain. The initial results of query, update, and delete operations demonstrate a set of advantages and disadvantages of the experiments' architectures. The Information Technology (IT) professional's role in defining the scope of the database project for a more bold choice of the NoSQL architecture is highlighted in a cost-benefit perspective for organizations.",

    "abstract": "Today is common the interest in monitoring the behavior of groups of different types in order to reach different objectives: improving individual and collective performance, tracing and monitoring, optimizing the performance of a task, pattern analysis, coordinated work, etc. In all these situations, we are faced with the challenge of equipping each person or entity with a device capable of collecting, storing and transmitting different parameters about their behavior for further analysis. Actually, there exist different EPTS (Electronic Performance & Tracking System), being usual applying them to study sport teams' behaviour. However, due to their elevated price and that previous infrastructure may be required, have led to the impossibility of using them, except for professional sport teams.Open-source electronic prototyping platforms' spreading, becoming cheaper sensors, and improving on wireless technologies, offer new opportunities on developing low cost EPTS. The present work focuses on the construction of a complete low-cost monitoring system, and consequently accessible for non-professional clubs or collectives, being this technology extrapolated to other non-sports fields. Compounding these systems and the application of appropriate software algorithms, will allow obtaining data related to the behavior of the individual with respect to the group, to improve his individual performance, resulting in a collective improvement in the execution of tasks.",

The achievement of that objective included the creation of key performance indicators (Key Performance Indicators, KPI) and the development of an analytical model, with a view to implementing these indicators in a dashboard, elaborated using Microsoft's Business Intelligence tool, the Power BI. As a result, the proposed solution is explored, as a management and decision support system, at the operational and strategic level, which allows CTCV decision makers to access relevant information in real time and in a dynamic and interactive way. The study also reveals the opportunity to apply the developed indicators to other organizations.",

It is believed that the recovery of the sector goes through a strong investment in technologies that allow creating and managing tourists' perception of the virtual image of tourist destinations. This article proposes a discussion about the relevance of User Generated Content (UGC) to reveal the virtual image of a tourist destination, in order to contribute to the creation of a Smart Tourism Destination (STD). The virtual image is studied from the perspective of the public transport system due to the fact that its improvement is one of the objectives of the Tourism of Portugal strategic plan for the creation of a STD in the decade 2017 - 2027. The methodology used was qualitative, through a bibliographical research, in which the key factors of this theme were addressed. After the study carried out it was concluded that the exploration of UGCs can allow managers and regulatory and tourism promoting entities to extract a lot of interesting information about how to take better advantage of the technologies adopted to create value for tourists.",

Technologies still used in those infrastructures---such as GSM-R, evolving into LTE-R are becoming more complex, yet more flexible, and evolving to \"software defined\" architectures. The technologies presented and explored in this work are expected to change the future of these types of critical systems. The main goal of this work is to study the key benefits of using the SDN model to control the next generation railways networking infrastructures. The safety, security and correctness properties of SDN controllers in high availability railway networks will be analyzed, for compliance with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)/European Train Control System (ETCS) specifications, and in the context of a real project being deployed in a Portuguese Railway by Thales Portugal. From the analysis of the project requirements and the selected network equipment, it was possible to evaluate and propose adequate methods to automatically derive network re-configuration strategies, namely in case of failure events---e.g., preventing packet loss affecting vital railway traffic signaling procedures---in order to reduce field intervention and complexity in those infrastructures.",

However, many of these processes have minor importance for the State, which promotes overload for highly specialized and expensive employees with non-important activities that could be performed automatically or redistributed to lower level professionals. The present work proposes a decision support approach for analyzing inheritance processes in a state attorney's office. The objective is to develop a system for collecting, classifying, analyzing and ranking processes using text mining and machine learning in order to automate the document analysis procedure in a semantic manner. The put forward approach offers a novel way for objectively distribute processes according to their monetary importance and the hierarchical level of the involved professionals. The approach also proposes a tunable semantic analysis, which takes into account the user experience for the automatic document ranking, which can be easily adapted for other analytical activities in attorney's offices.",

    "abstract": "Currently companies seek to constantly develop innovative solutions so that they remain competitive in the market. However, there is a lack of understanding on how to develop innovation skills, as well as the problem of not having a single interpretation of what constitutes the innovation process. Even though some studies published on this subject, few studies have investigated the sponsor's perspective on open innovation projects. In this work, a qualitative study has been carried out to investigate five sponsors and their perspectives on open innovation projects in the automotive, steel, oil, health, and energy sectors. The results of this study showed that the sponsors have an organizational perspective and a task perspective on the projects and they are not the same. The organizational perspective focuses on building relationships between the base organization (sponsoring company) and the project team (temporary organization), seeking to create an adequate solution to the problem they are seeking to solve. The second perspective, the task point of view, focuses on the partners that carry out the tasks that they think will produce innovative results. The experiences shared here can help other stakeholders to better understand the reality of open innovation projects.",

To achieve the objective, an exploratory research was carried out, with a quantitative approach via structural equations. A questionnaire was applied to 139 civil servants from 15 different public government organizations. The results identified a significant mediating effect of Corporate Risk Management in the relationship between business strategies and the performance of Brazilian public institutions, and a direct ratio of 13.3%. Therefore, institutions must dedicate themselves to corporate risk management as a factor that enhances their business strategies. Examining Risk Management, it was observed that it was explained in 32.1%, with the variables that most impact being cost leadership, followed by differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Segment Routing (SR) is an implementation of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for traffic routing. It derives from a source routing paradigm where each node, at the network's periphery, adds a list of labels to the packet's header defining explicitly the path each traffic flow should follow to its destination. Each label is a segment that identifies a topological instruction, a service, or even a processing instruction. Although SR can be very similar to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), concerning the simple routing of packets, its utilization simplifies the network management tasks. On the other hand, SR provides solutions to existing scalability problems on SDN implementations, for example, OpenFlow-based. This technology is rapidly becoming a standard and is already supported by big players such as Cisco and Huawei, performing a fundamental role in the architecture of future 5G networks. Also, due to these new technology capabilities, there is an increasing number of novel services. This growth, allied with the rise of 5G capable devices, motivated the deployment of services on crucial points of the network. Consequently, mobile operators created the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concept. However, some important questions should be considered, such as how to optimize network resources regarding service locations to reduce the congestion level on the network. The main contribution of this work consists of exploring solutions based on SR and NFV. Thus, relying on optimization techniques to pursue optimal resource allocation for traffic routing and service processing requirements.",

The approach to television promotional strategies on social networks requires adaptation according to the age, interests and needs of the target audiences. In this sense, expansive narratives have been used as a claim to offer wider viewing experiences linked to multiscreen audiovisual consumption and spreaded thought social networks used as a broadcaster. This study focuses on identifying the strategies used by Radio Televisión Española (RTVE) to cater to its diverse audience by analyzing the Instagram profile of the series “HIT” aimed at a general audience, and the series “Wake up” of RTVE's Playz platform aimed at a youth audience. To each profile is carried out an analysis of the publications identifying the type of content according to the classic or expansive promotional classification. The period of analysis runs from 24 January, with the first publication of the profile, to 23 November 2020 of “HIT”, and in the case of “Wake up” from 24 March 2018 to 11 December 2018, which corresponds to the first season in both cases. 179 publications on “HIT” profile and 153 in the case of “Wake up” has been treated as analysis corpus.",

The purpose is the capture of data in extreme climatological environments, for the precise obtaining three-dimensional Digital Surface Models of glaciers (DSM). These models will be the base for glaciology studies. The distinctiveness of this work lies in the fact that it was the first time that drones were used in the Spanish Antarctic area and the need to adapt the conventional methodology to an environment of extreme weather conditions. This methodology was applied to a real case, the Johnsons and Hurd glaciers, on Livingston Island. The results were compared with other data obtained from the same glacier by other techniques, which allowed to validate the reliability of the methodology used and will be published through Web services (WMS) in a prototype of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) of the Spanish Antarctica.",

However, with a large number of users to resort to it as their primary source of information and with an increasing number of accounts spreading newsworthy content, a characterization of the political bias associated with the social network ecosystem becomes necessary. In this work, we aim at analyzing accounts spreading or publishing content from five different classes of the political spectrum. We also look further and study accounts who spread content from both right and left sides. Conclusions show that there is a large presence of accounts which disseminate right bias content although it is the more central classes that have a higher influence on the network. In addition, users who spread content from both sides are more actively spreading right content with opposite content associated with criticism towards left political parties or promoting right political decisions.",

To show this relationship, information from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru was used. The results show that high-tech exports meet the inverted U of the environmental Kuznets curve, that is, over time with this type of export, the impact on emissions decreased, while GDP per capita has an increasing relationship) In other words, emissions continue to increase. As a recommendation, we highlight the importance of the production of high-technology products, since a productive economy tends to develop due to the effects of increasing returns that are the result of an economy of scale.",

    "abstract": "The research shows the relationship between Human Capital and Technology (using mobile phone subscriptions as a proxy variable) in Latin American growth (Gross Domestic Product at constant prices). To show this relationship, information was used from 13 Latin American countries, divided by income, in the period from 1980 to 2017. The results show a positive and significant relationship between human capital and technology for economic growth for the region and for countries high and low income. For middle-income countries, the results were not significant. Finally, it is recommended that the policies established by governments, in addition to seeking financing and investment mechanisms in Human Capital and Technology, should also guarantee the conditions so that at the internal level of each country, these investments can be used equitably.",

In this paper, we describe an architecture for a Massive Open Online Essays Evaluations (MO2E2) which allows us to concurrently monitor several graders and their performance. Furthermore, we carry out some statistical tests on their evaluations to compare them. Therefore, our model quantifies the reliability and the concordance among graders. In the obtained results we highlight the disagreement between the evaluators, specifically for Competence 1, with a low degree of correlation, and unsatisfactory performance in the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) analysis. Competencies that often denote a sharp discrepancy are a sign of the need for retraining to align the evaluators.",

A rebuilding application was developed using interfaces provided by ReconstructMe SDK and a Kinect as a depth device. An analysis tool working on the Unity engine was also implemented, operating mainly on the terminology of the Editor Scripting with its C# API feature. This tool implements the capacity of obtaining the x, y and z measurement data of volumetric extremes of the virtual objects. The virtual reconstruction of objects proposal is tested by rebuilding of some specific objects, which are the closest resource; by manually conducting the device while trying to encircle the target object under limited spacial conditions. With results, the application faces some problems with the mesh fitting of some objects, however, the mesh quality is relatively good. Based on data measured with the analysis tool, it is achieved a good level of precision on the extreme measures besides that each rebuilding procedure can be made within a relatively fast time cost, around 25 s. Yet the proposal’s viability can be considered, based on its reconstruction capacity even if it’s using a low-cost device, considering that other 3D Scanner devices are generally expensive and may impose several limitations.",

The AR is still little known and exploited in an educational context in Portugal, and for this reason a qualitative study has been chosen on: \"The Augmented Reality as the enabler of learning in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education\". The study was carried out in a group of 21 students from the second year of schooling in the methodology of Distance Learning (E@D). This study has allowed us to reflet that the integration of AR into the teaching and learning process allows pupils to increase their motivation for learning through a more motivating approach. The RA can be a learning tool, and it is a valid support for the teacher in the monopolization of pedagogical activities. The results obtained, after analyzing and processing the data, have enabled us to verify that the AR can be a enabler of learning, in that it promotes new learning contexts, more innovative and motivating for today's students. The study concluded that ICT and AR integrated into an educational environment can create a more stimulating and interactive environment by promoting richer and more meaningful learning for pupils, given their involvement in the various activities proposed to them.",

Smart devices are constantly communicating through the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, either by sending collected data and notifying the actions taken or by receiving instructions for actions to be taken. Most of this communication requires the confidentiality of data through the usage of encryption algorithms, being the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm one of the most used. However, how do the operation modes of AES algorithm perform in a resource-constraint device? This paper aims to evaluate the impact on the time to encrypt and decrypt different sized messages in IoT devices when using each one of the five AES modes of operation and the three key sizes defined. The test scenario was implemented using two programming languages, running on a Raspberry Pi device. The results achieved infers that Python was quicker and had a more homogeneous result set than JavaScript implementation in most AES operation modes. These results help to understand the trade-off between IoT devices' security needs and delays in communication caused by the selection of the AES algorithm operation mode.",

One of the phases of the genetic algorithms requires a fitness function, which will allow to select the individuals of the next generation. This aptitude function is generally implemented based on mathematical expressions or functions.However, some of the problems that can be solved with genetic algorithms present the difficulty of requiring subjective information to define the fitness function; above all, when the individual selection process requires an assessment conditioned by sensory aspects or experience. In these cases, defining the fitness function mathematically presents a lot of complexity or becomes unfeasible.The present work aims to find computer solutions to this type of problem, embedding the support vector machines in the implementation of the fitness functions of the genetic algorithms.",

Although aggression is an ancient phenomenon, this type of violence is a recent one and has aroused interest around the world thanks to its negative valence and its still comprehensive configuration. In this sense, the objective of this work is to provide a integrative literature review of empirical research related to the phenomenon of cyber violence, popularly known as cyberbullying. The aim of this study is to observe what has been produced and conceived in Brazil as such and consequently to track which are the instruments of clinical profile that evaluate this problem. In this way, 12 articles from the last 5 years (2015-2019) were found and analyzed. The results showed a certain lack with regard to the instrumentation of clinical evaluation on the theme, the importation of the paradigms that configure bullying from other countries, in addition to a wide variation in the conception of its profile, whether as a specific type of violence and which has its subtypes themselves or being a subtype of traditional bullying itself.",

However, there is a need to make this illustration through mechanisms that facilitate the retention of attention, and the enthusiasm during this learning, hence the need to have playful elements as facilitators of this process. Among the ludic activities, the digital game has been used more and more as a means for information transition, and above all to influence and change behaviors. Making young people create digital games around marine litter with emphasis on plastic pollution and developing them by visual tools, is believed to be a much more engaging mechanism that will boost knowledge and behavior change in relation to this theme. The work focuses on developing and validating a tool to support the creation of digital games to promote environmental awareness, targeting young adults in higher education in the city of Pemba, Cabo-Delgado province, northern Mozambique.",

    "abstract": "This article aimed to present the factors that most influence the successful implementation of information technology governance. An analysis of 15 years of contributions from the literature was carried out (2005-2020), and several factors were found that are directly related to this superior performance. To discover which factors had the most significant degree of influence, an exploratory research was carried out, with a quantitative approach via equations and variance in two Brazilian public banking institutions. 123 professionals evaluated the questionnaire, and the results revealed that the perception of employees is of vital importance for the success of governance in information technology, with an influence of 53.3%. It is only through this perception that the actions taken institutionally can impact IT governance's satisfactory performance. Among the factors that stood out the most is Business Policies (0.699). Business Policies are related to strategic decision-making processes and corporate policies information, directly affecting Corporate Governance and, consequently, IT Governance. Thus, for companies to improve their IT Governance, they must act to improve the process of defining and reviewing guidelines and standards geared to business policies to improve the conduct of organizational processes, strengthen the \"Business Policies\" indicator, and positively influences the performance of IT Governance. Although it has not reached the desired level of significance, it is expected to be closer to the indicators \"Competence Management\" and \"Organization and its structures\".",

Fieldwork was conducted in ten institutions in 2014, through thirty long-term semi-structured interviews. The central argument is that the creation of repositories rests on the casual and informal use of ideas, people and artefacts in concrete circumstances, which are accountable by the very actors who were involved in them. From a relational standpoint, the creation of repositories can best be understood as an everyday phenomenon that takes shape from the margins (bottom-up), without a prior normative, social and technical order.",

In the first phase, the characterization of the existing software tools in the accounting field was carried out. In the second phase the relevance of them was determined. In the third phase, the performance was evaluated to later classify them in a repository. The use of TACs in the classroom by the experimental group resulted in an improvement in their academic performance compared to the control group, strengthening their self-learning processes and facilitating the development of the cognitive functions and skills necessary in the exercise of your accounting profession. Finally, the data obtained were analyzed with parametric analysis techniques by which it was found that the difference in the quantitative results in the academic process between the experimental and the control group was statistically significant, which concluded the success of the experimental treatment.",

In Brazil, higher education institutions were ordered by the State to cease in-person classes. This work aims to evaluate the factors that contribute to the success of e-learning platforms during the pandemic, when the migration from in-person classes to online classes was compulsory. This is an exploratory research, with quantitative and qualitative approach, making use of structural equation modeling. The sample used was 115 participants who answered a validated questionnaire (α = 0.88), with questions about the e-learning system adopted by the institution. Thus, the variables that most influenced the Individual Impact and the Use of e-learning systems were User Perceived Satisfaction, which had the most impact variables on Computer Anxiety and Interaction with Others. This result indicates that the establishment of routines with interactive classes and the attention to students who may feel uncomfortable with new technologies are crucial for the success of e-learning systems.",

That way, it is necessary to search for the development of new solutions or improvements to existing ones. Edge computing is one of the solutions that have been used to improve the care of these types of devices. In this work, we proposed a mechanism that uses the whale optimization algorithm for 5G-IoT resource allocation decision in edge computing (TRIAD). The TRIAD was compared with the Greedy and Reliable techniques, available in the literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm had excellent efficiency in the service of the devices, in addition to denying fewer requests and blocking fewer devices during the search. The TRIAD, in some situations of the simulation, served approximately 265% more services, denied 56% less requests and blocked 65% less services.",

In addition, with the same model, other images were trained to predict the image of cocoa compared to other fruits similar to cocoa, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 96%. Due to the good results obtained in this work, we believe that this tool can help cocoa farmers to identify phytophthora and to obtain healthy cocoa crops.",

    "abstract": "No one argues the usefulness of the Internet of Things. Whether it is for our home comfort or for traffic control, the idea of interconnected devices is merely a consequence of the Internet's growth and holds great potential for bringing good. However, as IoT devices become more common, we pay for the services they support with our personal data and ultimately with our giving away of privacy for comfort. In order to protect citizens from abuses of data usage and regulate companies' behaviors towards private information, governments have come up with regulatory measures that aim to balance the technological growth with the evolution of our societies. The agreement whose impact worldwide was the greatest is EU's General Data Protection Regulation, enforced in 2018. Two years on, such regulations have only been able to tackle the issue of security and no relevant advancements on the privacy front seem to be under development. In this paper we present the problem the regular consumer is facing by explaining why the efforts to ensure the application of the European regulation are not fully applied. The aim is to clarify the consequences of not achieving solid solutions within the context of the Internet of Things and offer some examples of successful GDPR compliant IoT cases where development guidelines for the future can be derived from.",

    "abstract": "A key priority for organizations is to have a more adaptive IT governance model. Traditional governance, based on a directive model and designed to control risk and reduce the pace of change (such as COBIT or ISO 38500), competes with the increasing reliance on digital business. The question is what change in perspective is required to achieve a more adaptive governance model. To perform this analysis, we have turned to other disciplines, different from the world of Agile, and for this we have taken as a reference the field of organizational design and development. Based on this approach, we have seen that making a change from a directive model to an adaptive one is not simply a matter of applying a methodology, but also involves changing the way we perceive organizations: (1) changing our perspective to complexity thinking, where we conceive organizations as living systems, as complex adaptive systems; (2) the socio-technical design approach, which recommends looking at people, culture, knowledge, processes, and technology as a whole. In this paper, we collect reflections on how the IT governance model should be an enabler for the human system (socio-technical) to generate the greatest value for the organization.",

This work continues the research of the speech signal spectrum and presents a solution that merges the parameters previous presented and implements a method for detecting outliers by analyzing the dispersion of the parameters. Although the new parameter presents discrimination rates in line with the previous ones, it can be an asset in screening other pathologies associated with the voice. On the other hand, the method for detecting outliers has potential to detect false positives, an improvement in the results obtained. All the parameters presented are easy to analyze and interpret visually, hoping to enhance the analysis of spectra in non-invasive screening situations.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness in developed countries. Since this disease remains asymptomatic in the early stages, periodic screening is of utmost importance. However, the success of screening programmes depends largely on the adherence of the target population. Thus, the development of computer simulations that make it possible to understand the factors correlated with the individual decision to adhere to the screening or not, to predict low adherence rates and to define strategies that promote its increase, is very useful. The aim of the present research is to demonstrate that it is possible to simulate the behavior of adherence to screening, using a model with a high degree of abstraction and scalability. To this end, a model based on agents with fuzzy logic was developed, calibrated, and validated using real data from 271,867 calls for screening in the Northern Regional Health Administration. The results obtained are very close to the real ones, both in the training and in the test sets, which attests to the validity of the model for the study of this problem and use as a predictive tool for public health planning.",

The development of such a complex technological environment raises a two-fold concern: to promote a simpler modular customisation, and to promote the domain expert’s involvement in the process. This requires a new approach on the specification of IIoT architecture, where the conceptualisation phase is crucial. In this context, semantics might play an impacting role, accommodating the multidisciplinary knowledge of IIoT architectures in a technological artefact, at the service of both technological architects and companies’ domain experts. This paper discusses a semantic model to represent IIoT components, its conceptual relations, and technical constraints in a common view, supporting the construction of both IIoT concept and platforms within organisations.",

Postmarket surveillance studies are important to obtain information about rare adverse events (AE). Traditional methods of postmarket surveillance are dependent on spontaneous notifications and are therefore subject to underreporting. Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been used for the information extraction. We did a survey on recent papers that have used NER to supplement postmarket surveillance systems based on the information extraction of social media, with predominance of websites related to some health topics, electronic health records (EHR), official databases and reference databases. We present negative and positive endorses for each approach of the use of NER and propose a guide for the use of NER in the information extraction task to supplement traditional postmarket surveillance systems.",

Over the past two decades, interlinguistic studies have been using eye-tracking techniques to investigate language comprehension and production. Studies demonstrate the use of these techniques in populations with neurological or speech-language disorders, including aphasia. To investigate the use of eye-tracking techniques in Brazilian aphasic individuals, the authors are proposing a study to analyze sentence comprehension in the elderly with Broca’s aphasia. In this context, this article presents a literature review to define a methodology for conducting the study, and analyzes the use of eye tracking when evaluating cognitively healthy elderly by the Test for Reception of Grammar (TROG-2). The studies gathered in the literature review provided subsidies to define the screening process, select stimulus from TROG-2, and define metrics of interest using eye tracking.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of technological trends such as the Internet of Things is a challenge for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), considering their financial and technological limitations. Based on the literature review, IoT readiness in SMEs is related to two factors: availability of ICT infrastructure and organizational culture focused on adopting digital technologies. Likewise, the CIO is the person in charge of developing the digital transformation strategy and leading the IoT projects' execution. In particular, addressing the needs of Colombian SMEs, this article presents five guidelines to promote SMEs' IoT readiness, considering the Technology-Organization-Environment Model (TOE): The CIO as leader of the digital transformation process in SMEs, Training programs focused on promoting IoT skills in employees, Transition to high-speed broadband, Acquisition of low-cost IoT solutions suitable for SMEs, and Participation in digital transformation programs. Additionally, the document highlights the need for public policies focused on the massification of IoT.",

As the network supports an increasing number of hosts, it becomes relevant to understand how the network performs. This article presents an analysis on the performance of SDN simulator networks as the number of hosts scales. The Mininet simulation ran 12 topologies, each of which with an increasing number of devices, initially on the number of client hosts and then on the number of switches. The analysis metrics were collected through network parameters of the TCP and UDP protocols. The simulations revealed that balanced networks distribute more evenly packet traffic and achieve greater performance.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems collect electromagnetic radiation, emitted or reflected by the scene under observation at, typically, hundreds of contiguous and regularly spaced narrow spectral bands, from the visible to the infra-red region of the spectrum. The result is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions and a wavelength dimension, composed of hundreds of co-registered images containing information on the spectral signature of the materials present in the field of view of the sensor at the time of capture. Retrieving this information in an efficient way, requires compute systems capable of dealing with a huge amount of data and complex algorithms. The recent development of single board computers (SBC) with enough compute power to deal with HSI processing using machine learning (ML) algorithms opens new opportunities for embedded HSI systems for Earth Observation remote sensing, laboratory setups and industrial applications. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the ODROID-XU4, a heterogeneous computing device, running ML algorithms for HSI classification. The experimental results show the potential of SBC as alternative hardware platforms for applications requiring low power and low cost devices, such as onboard processing units and edge computing.",

This leads to the accumulation of technical debt. Objective: This study aims at identifying primary studies that describe how startups are applying agile development practices and how they could benefit from these practices, thereby contributing to product quality improvement and better resource allocation. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study was conducted which applied automatic searches so as to identify relevant primary studies. Results: 60 primary studies were identified that present information regarding practices, challenges, and limitations of adopting agile development practices in startups and also the benefits, tools, and ways of simplifying their adoption. Conclusions: 55 agile development practices used by startups were found, the most cited ones being associated with DevOps, Test Automation, and Scrum. The main challenges and limitations are related to the difficulty of adapting legacy systems architecture to support DevOps practices, to market volatility, to the need for quick product release, and to resources, including financial resources, being limited. Benefits related to having improved internal processes were the most cited and 128 tools were classified. Few studies have offered answers on how to simplify adopting agile development practices, although all of them led to tools for automating processes being used.",

Unfortunately, many concurrent applications, including hard real time ones, have complex interactions between tasks, which are difficult to model in order to understand or evaluate the system's behaviour by simulation. Although an accurate model for these interactions is quite desirable, most simulators do not provide this capability, representing tasks as independent black-boxes. This paper describes a graphical approach to model tasks interactions as hierarchical trees. The approach was implemented in a simulator of real-time schedulers, and the results achieved with tests over model accuracy and tool usability are presented.",

Using it farmers can generate a favorable controlled environment for the germination and growth of seedlings in the production of transplant seedlings. Temperature, humidity, luminosity, air quality and water level sensors were used, accompanied by actuators such as fans, water pump, heating and LED lighting, managed by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ board. The development of the local programming used the Python programming language on the Linux-based Raspberry Pi OS operating system, being able to store information by implementing the PostgreSQL relational database management system and transmitting data by connecting to the Internet wirelessly. At the same time, the cultivation chamber works under the supervision of a web application on the Thingsboard.io cloud computing platform for IoT projects, aimed at the remote management of the agroclimatic parameters necessary for the cultivated plant variety. This experimental research was supported by an study of the state of the art concerning the generation of controlled environments in agriculture, such as cultivation chambers and automated greenhouses, and validated through a process of observation and evaluation of the operation of the tool during the period of growth of transplant seedlings.",

Given that ageism, widely present in society, appears early and has an impact on the way children interact to the elderly and perceive their own aging process, it is important to understand the messages related to aging that are present in the media, especially in the content intended for children. To help understand the messages about old age and aging that are being transmitted to young audiences, this study analyzed the representation of elderly people in the most viewed animation films in Portugal's theatres, during the period from 2008 to 2018, using an adapted analysis grid. The results indicate that although there is a balance between positive and negative representations, the elderly characters are represented with a lack of diversity, with a minor role for the movie's plot and with a series of features commonly used throughout most animated films.",

    "abstract": "Tracing the numerous artifacts produced during a software project is challenging. It is not uncommon to overlook this aspect due to the additional workload to keep organized and effective records of what changes between iterations. In this work, we propose a lightweight approach called U-til for traceability management focusing on the impact of changes in both user stories and test cases. We have conducted a case study to assess the proposal's impact concerning the efficiency to manage the requirements traceability from the point of view of testers and requirements analysts in the context of an industry software project. We performed quantitative and qualitative analysis before and after applying our approach and observed that it helped the team to manage requirements dependencies and improved the traceability between user stories and test cases.",

New proposals for managing large volumes of data have been defined in the literature, such as the storage and analysis of data by non-relational DBMS, or NoSQL (Not-only SQL) Databases, under a Big Data scenario. Thus, Data Warehouses, which originally relied on relational databases, have been using NoSQL databases to analyze this massive data in recent years. Besides, there is the rise of hybrid transactional and analytical processing, in real-time, known as HTAP, which provides simplicity and quick support to decision making. In this context, this article has the objective to accomplish a literature mapping of DW based on NoSQL databases and advances in HTAP.

To this end, they apply a methodology that makes it possible to identify the general and specific competencies associated with the LO. At the same time, the methodology takes into account both the technical and pedagogical perspectives of this process, promoting the development of a quality object. The object developed is intended to be included in an Open Access Institutional Repository (OAIR) so that it is available for different subjects corresponding to STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).",

That is to say, good or bad academic performance in the first semester at the institution, which will subsequently redound in future semesters. The prediction will help us to project strategies that together with the institution, teachers, students, and parents can improve their activities of the teaching-learning process. To achieve the purpose of prediction, Machine Learning will be used, specifically, classification techniques to design a predictive model that allows to determine the academic performance of students and reduce their desertion, likewise to determine the best predictive algorithm.",

One of the potential approaches to this new paradigm is the creation of information flows across the entire value chain to empower users, increase their knowledge about the product they are buying and feedback producers with data about the customers' opinions, preferences, and recommendations. To allow a transparent path for information in the value chain, new digital platforms and tools are needed to connect users, producers, and suppliers. DEMETER is a European project focused on improving the efficiency of agri-food sector, according to Industry 4.0 principles. In this paper, we are describing the use case of DEMETER project focused on bakery industry. Five different experiments focused on sharing four different information sources, together with the corresponding tools to guarantee the reliability and transparency of that information, are planned. Recently, results from the first experiment have been obtained and are reported in this paper. Results show how users' satisfaction highly increases when enriched and personalized production information about products is available through, for example, mobile applications. In the future, this mechanism will include more information from suppliers and other related agents to analyze if this also represents a relevant increase in the users' satisfaction.",

The Covid-19 pandemic forced businesses to adopt a temporary remote-working mode. Now managers are investigating whether this \"new\" working-mode is, or not, a better approach than the traditional working mode known as the \"office model\". The proposed framework will support the transformation process from a physical into a remote work model supported by applying digital tools and methods. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this work aims to help business decision makers to decide which organizational model they should adopt after Covid-19: full-remote; \"hybrid\" or partially remote; or physical, also known as \"going back to the office\". A simple and pragmatic framework is proposed to help organizations: understand if it's possible to transform a business from a physical (\"at the office\") to a full or partial remote model; define the main goals of this transformation; create a simple template to map the new digital enterprise architecture in terms of tools, data management, business processes and human resources (job functions and digital skills).",

    "abstract": "A crucial aspect to game development is the ability to establish the player emersion in a simulated and virtual world, presenting engaging content and maximizing the gaming experience. The demand for new and hand-customized content keeps increasing, in playable maps that are ever expanding in size, without compromising quality or differentiation. The usage of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) allows computers to generate game content and produce distinguishable and unique instances amongst the ones generated allowing to better replicate reality and deliver intricate systems without the costs and time consumption of human intervention. As a key element for the appeal of many games, natural life exhibits both complex and distinguishable behaviors, from species to species as well as from individual to individual. Biodiversity is maintained by processes operating over broader spatial and temporal scales, and as such, simulating plant diversity is a process better suited to operate under PCG algorithms. In this study, we describe a procedural flora evolution algorithm that can replicate a flora species life cycle for a practical 3D game setting (Universe 51), using scientific knowledge to better reproduce such intricate behaviors. We based some part our approach on complex intelligence algorithms, as well as in some original processes targeted at our project specificities. The evolution algorithm starts with the end results of a flora generation algorithm that can create millions of different flora species based on selected biological parameters. This data is then interpreted by the evolutionary algorithm, that uses these values to determine each species survival chances in the surrounding environment. Our results were able to replicate and autonomously manage plant species life cycle, under a dynamic environment with potentially varying conditions.",

    "abstract": "For software development to be conducted in an organized manner, contributing to the quality of the final product, it is necessary to train professionals in the correct use of Software Engineering concepts and their development methodologies. Among them, the agile philosophy stands out for its acceptance of changes, with Scrum and Extreme Programming being the most used agile methodologies today. However, the teaching of this philosophy in the undergraduate courses, including the specificities involving each agile methodology, faces challenges given the vast theoretical framework involved, which can cause demotivation in students. Educational games have proven to be effective in the teaching-learning process of Software Engineering in general. Although, current solutions still have some deficiencies, such as the lack of games involving the comparison between different agile methodologies, to enable future professionals to select the best one for specific projects. Therefore, this paper proposes a software architecture to guide future implementations of quality educational games to teach agile methodologies since it remedies deficiencies detected through an empirical analysis involving available common purpose games.",

Despite this goal, disparities between European regions still exist and the impact of such funds is questionable. What if it is possible to predict the success of such incentives when the funds are awarded to the beneficiaries? Using data from the database of The Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (IAPMEI), for the programs National Strategic Reference Framework (QREN), and Portugal 2020, two predictive models are developed to estimate the number of applications to be received and the schedule of expected payments to beneficiaries for a four-month period.

However, these changes should not compromise the result of the project, the stipulated budget, or even the delivery dates. When agile methodologies emerged, they came to help overcome the problems mentioned above. The adoption of agile methods has had a very strong growth in recent years, having a positive impact on software development, since it can handle and adjust to constant changes, without compromising the result of the product. Despite this, measuring agility is important for organizations to ensure that these methods are being leveraged and providing the best results for organizations. In this paper, a proposal is presented for a tool that meets these needs in an academic setting to make projects and the teams themselves more agile, mentioning the points of possible improvement. A questionnaire was created that covers the main goals of agile methodologies and is based on the agile manifesto.",

The symbolic manipulation of a MK is governed by a set of generic rules that allow the minimization / optimization of logic equations for control of the circuit. This complexity comes from the combinatorial explosion that results from the increase in the number of cylinders that make up the cycle to be automated. The symbolic learning approaches were implemented by searching the MK symbolic patterns space. This search allows, with the use of rules, to reduce the universe of search in the space of symbolic patterns and to obtain the ideal solution to control the pneumatic or electro-pneumatic circuit desired.",

    "abstract": "The consumer's profile and behaviour have undergone drastic changes in recent years, as a result of rapid technological developments associated with the proliferation of the Internet, which have boosted the growth of e-commerce. Retail needed to adopt new strategies to respond to new consumer demands leading to the development of omnichannel. The omnichannel strategy is centred on the consumer and aims to offer him/her a unique, consistent, and quality experience, through any contact point and wherever the consumer wants. However, most Portuguese retailers still opt for a multichannel strategy, where the physical shop and the online shop operate independently from each other. Although there are already some successful cases in Portugal, it can be considered that the use of omnichannel is still at an early stage. More publicity is needed so that retailers are aware of the concept and above all recognise the advantages of this new strategy. Before disclosure it is important to understand why companies work with both online and offline channels and do not opt for an omnichannel strategy. This study aims to analyse Portuguese companies that have not yet adopted an omnichannel strategy, to understand the barriers that make them unwilling to adopt this strategy. To this end, a quantitative research was carried out through the application of surveys to companies in different districts of Portugal to understand their position in relation to omnichannel and the reasons for not moving to this structure. The results obtained made it possible to describe the importance of omnichannel as a commercial and distribution strategy and analyse the reasons why its use by companies in Portugal is still extremely low. The lack of knowledge about the structure and management issues emerged as the biggest barriers.",

This evaluation was performed using the ISBSG R18 dataset and on the Support Vector Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, and Ridge Regression techniques. Results of the Scott-Knott analysis show that the genetic algorithms perform similar or better to the other tuners, achieving an improvement of standardized accuracy of up to 0,21 and final values of up to 0,53. Genetic algorithm-tuned Support Vector Regression achieves the highest accuracy while improving estimation stability relative to other tuners.",

In this context, this study addresses the proposal and implementation of the Immersive Brain Puzzle that aims to assist the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients and stimulate motor and cognitive activities (dual task) by presenting a virtual reality puzzle. It is assumed that treatment in the first hours after a stroke event can significantly contribute to the patient's progress and recovery; thus, our application was developed to be used in the intensive care unit (ICU). The next stage of this research consists of its validation within the hospital environment to be carried out at the Brazilian Institute of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (CEPID BRAINN) - Unicamp.",

The developed computational method for the stochastic variant allows to realistically simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a medium-sized community and to study the effect of preventive measures such as quarantine and vaccination. The results of the simulations are compared with the deterministic version of the SEIR model. The comparison makes it possible to conclude that the epidemic outbreak can be prevented even though the basic reproduction number is greater than one.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been a marked increase in bank fraud by SMS (Short Messaging System) and voice. One of the factors contributing to increase in cases of SMS fraud is the low cost of acquiring large volumes of messages, the reliability (the message will reach the recipient) and the fact that it does not need the Internet to reach the victim. In relation to financial fraud by voice, these can be used to persuade victims to make bank transfers to fraudulent accounts, with the promise of receiving large sums in prizes. The prevention of these types of fraud is not a trivial task, as it requires the application of appropriate techniques and methods depending on their nature. This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) from 2015 to 2020, with the aim of analyzing the state of the art on bank frauds committed by SMS or voice. The SLR allowed the identification of the most common types of bank fraud by SMS or voice, and the respective detection techniques.",

This model has a form of a converter of a natural language text to its semantic structure. The project basically consists in enriching the ETAP-4 linguistic processor, developed at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems (IITP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, with a new module – that of semantic analysis. An important feature of this module is that it uses not only linguistic knowledge incorporated in the grammar and the combinatorial dictionary, but also extralinguistic knowledge stored in the ontology and contextual information accumulated in the repository of individuals. We developed an ontology that serves as the semantic metalanguage for semantic structures. This knowledge permits to make different types of inferences, which extract implicit information. Several examples are given that show how all these knowledge sources can be used, how the meaning is represented and what inferences can be made.",

This article introduces a framework for the development of an emotion-based decision support tool for learning processes. As a case study, we consider undergraduate students starting their academic year virtually in the context of a pandemic. Through the application of the PANAS questionnaire and NLP techniques on free-text responses, students' emotions are automatically classified as positive and negative, as well as a level of basic emotions of the Plutchik model. The results allow to identify the most frequent sentiments in students. Also, they show concordances between both measurement instruments and a high capacity for the classification of emotions.",

The subject is so important mainly with regard to the support of the architectural maturity model in National Organizations for Official Statistics. However, this research has not yet been carried out, which means that there is a gap in relation to scientific knowledge. This project, therefore, aims to conduct new research in order to build a new framework to address this issue, and thus contribute to knowledge. The design science research method was selected for this research, as it is suitable for design, in addition to its pragmatic and positivist character. Two organizations producing official statistics from two different countries (Portugal and Mozambique) were selected for the empirical study and the validation of the final result. The expectation is that the new framework allows technological solutions to meet the requirements of the organizations involved in the statistical production process, generating compliance and alignment with its strategic objectives and ensuring that Information Technology takes the right actions to deliver benefits in short time.",

After accomplishing a systematic literature review looking for the clarification of the main concepts of gamification and flipped classroom, it was performed a case study which main purpose was to identify and analyze how students react to the use of educational games as diagnostic or formative evaluation. Many tools were evaluated, but only four were chosen, which were: Kahoot!, Socrative, Quizizz and Nearpods. Subsequently, these tools were distributed to the third year of the course of management degree through Google Classroom and shared with other professors of the European community through the platform AduLeT (Advanced use of Learning Technologies in Higher Education). That contributed to share and reuse strategies to face the world’s current scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We can affirm henceforth that all the use experiences, which related a learning method with one of the tools referred, showed satisfactory results involving a greater dynamic and interest during the classes.",

There is no general method to forecast mortality rate applicable to all situations especially for unusual years such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using an ensemble of traditional and machine learning time series methods to empower forecasts of age-specific mortality rates for groups of countries that share common longevity trends. We use Generalized Age-Period-Cohort stochastic mortality models to capture age and period effects, apply K-means clustering to time series to group countries following common longevity trends and use ensemble learning to forecast future longevity and annuity price markers. To calibrate models, we use data for 14 European countries from 1960 to 2018. The results show that the ensemble method presents the best robust results overall with minimum RMSE in the presence of structural changes in the shape of time series at the time of COVID-19.",

This project aims to develop an automated system for the collection, organization, dissemination and visualization of fires. This solution seeks to be a low-cost alternative to the environmental police, firefighters and fire brigades on the farms, as it does not require expensive equipment, and can help them in their investigations and preparation of combat teams. The system development process was based on gathering requirements with the environmental police in the city of Catanduva and using open data from the forest fires program of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This data was used to apply clustering algorithms which helps in the preparation and dispersion of combat teams. The application was completed and evaluated through tests and demonstrations with the entities involved with the project. It is concluded that the project may modify the way the police and combatants work, since the elaborated system organizes the information in a way that creates a simple and dynamic workflow, solving the existing difficulties.",

Even today, despite technology and scientific advances, these diseases are still topical, evolving in the form of outbreaks that wreak havoc and take doctors and public health professionals by surprise. Discovered and treated in time can prevent possible epidemics or pandemics. One way of doing this is to make the many resources that are shared via the internet speak for themselves. This will consist of intelligently processing this massive resource of information, while taking into account the complexity linked to the fact that this information may be in various formats, sometimes described as non-standard, thus limiting the application of NLP techniques. In this document, we present our work which consists in extracting events and qualitative data from the text for the monitoring of infectious diseases. The extraction process will be based on Machine Learning techniques and guided by a domain ontology. Given the number of infectious diseases we will focus our study-on meningitis and COVID.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, low power consumption wide area networks (LPWAN) have achieved great versatility in their implementation for IoT applications in areas of difficult access and large extensions. LoRaWAN is one of the technologies that under this concept provides us long-range coverage and low energy consumption that operates in free ISM bands without any cost. Through the OMNeT ++ network simulation platform, it is possible to obtain performance indicators such as the data extraction rate (DER), energy consumed by nodes, loss of packets, among others that allow to determine the appropriate location of the nodes and gateways in a wireless sensor network (WSN). This work aims to simulate the use of a LoRa network as radio access technology (RAT) in different sizes of typical shrimp exploitation scenarios in extensive rural areas. The data obtained from performance indicators is analyzed based on the behavior of the simulation for a correct location of water quality sensor spots inside the scenario.",

It has a large incidence in tropical countries, having a significant number of cases in South America. Due to the annual epidemics of dengue, and aiming at promoting a more effective prevention measure, it was proposed the development of an unmanned aerial device, composed of a drone and a software with deep learning, capable of identifying foci and ejecting biomedicine capsules to eliminate the larvae of this insect, which proliferates mainly in foci of standing water. The deep learning software, using a backpropagation-type algorithm, is capable of identifying and classifying possible foci of Aedes aegypti, indicating to a controller the command to eject the biomedicine that eliminates the mosquito larvae, thus contributing to public health, by controlling the proliferation of such problem.",

Most of these applications deal with the storage and processing of sensitive information. In software development projects, many teams choose to use frameworks to assist in the development process, reducing application delivery times. However, aspects of information security may not be prioritized, generating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious attacks. This paper presents an assessment of the security techniques present in the Laravel framework for protection against attacks in web applications based on the ten vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top Ten. Through the security tests carried out, it was possible to identify which vulnerabilities Laravel has defense mechanisms, how developers can use them to protect user data and which vulnerabilities the framework lacks resources to defend against external attacks.",

    "abstract": "Acquired brain damage in children is increasingly frequent, and as main deficit produces motor alterations that manifest as the child grows, affecting muscle tone, coordination and motor control, in order to influence these aspects, fine motor skills are intervened, since these involve a coordinated effort of the brain and muscles, having a direct impact on the learning capacity of children and can improve their independence and autonomy. Although traditional therapies have been proven with great effectiveness, there are also different rehabilitation systems that make use of tracking devices, however not all of them are accessible due to their high cost or the lack of specialists who master them. That is the reason a low-cost optical tracking Controller System is proposed to complement fine motor-oriented rehabilitation, allowing movements to be captured with precision and to obtain feedback on the accuracy of the exercises. In this paper we focus on the first stage referring to the formal specification of the requirements and their validation. The proposal is based on the Leap Motion optical tracking device and limited to exercises with a fine motor and wrist. The controller system aims to provide a better environment for users to run their rehabilitation process, in addition to considering the rehabilitation progress. The proposal uses formal specifications to reduce possible ambiguities in the face of a system that may cause future damage to its users if the rehabilitation is not carried out correctly, in the same way they are used to validate the main properties of the functional requirements. The formal specification language VDM ++ is used to describe the system properties for later modeling and validation through the VDMToolBox tool. As a result, a formal specification of 4 requirements and a 100% coverage analysis were achieved.",

As a result, many studies are trying to develop appropriate solutions to tackle hardware security threats such as IC piracy, IC overbuilding, reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and tampering. Hardware obfuscation has been introduced as one of the leading robust, low-cost security solutions against different security threats, especially when combined with physical unclonable functions. Considering the inherent irreproducibility of PUFs, this method can provide a high-level security system. However, finding an applicable existent PUF or implementing a new PUF design that meets each hardware obfuscation requirements is not a trivial task. This study reviews and discusses hardware security systems based on PUFs inherited variations and the corresponding hardware obfuscation approaches.",

    "abstract": "The primary research goal is to understand the transactional sales data, in particular, to catch the principal characteristics of the sales, in terms of quantities, sales amount, and invoices similarities, and to find patterns in customer purchases. This project explores the practical applications of Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Mining to sports brand retailers. Starting from an extensive database of customer transactions, where each transaction consists of an item purchased by a customer in a visit, this project applied Business Intelligence (BI) solutions and Data Mining through MySQL and RapidMiner. The analysis outcome is a deeper understanding of interrelated products customer purchase behaviour (most purchase items; items purchased by the customer; items bought together). The massive amount of information available and the various forms of storage has become an issue - causing difficulty in transforming and using the data. Therefore, we apply exploratory information management tools and techniques for seasonal data (single month sales). BI Solutions system adds fast data processing, intelligent correlation analysis, a multidimensional analysis target, and the most specific decision-making data through continuous analysis and progressive selection. Cross-selling, collaborative filtering and even up-selling can be easily used and revisit store layout improving store customer service and experience. A deeper understanding of customer behaviour, interrelationships between products as customers purchase them, and recommendations to improve the strategy.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to identify which are the relationships between knowledge management and quality management in organizational performance, through the analysis of facilitators, mediators and existing results between the elements. The method used was an integrative literature review, based on the PRISMA recommendation. The data survey was carried out in Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO databases. The searches took place in October 2020. Based on a group of 19 scientific articles belonging to the study areas: management, business, operations and economics, the authors analyzed the research and recommendations in the context of organizations. The most frequent relationship between the constructs presented was quality management as a facilitating element and knowledge management as a mediating element in achieving organizational performance. The most frequent knowledge management practices and processes were knowledge sharing and acquisition. Regarding the principles and practices of quality management, a greater number of articles using the principles of TQM were identified. Knowledge management and quality management have a positive relationship in the performance of organizations. The use of only two variables can help in the identification of relationships, although an analysis of organizational performance in an integrated manner requires an analysis from different perspectives, including new variables. The performance indicators present in the articles were not entirely objective. In addition, it was evident the absence of studies that had emerging and innovative economies as a population.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of bullying in schools has contributed significantly to the urgent need for training on this topic, both for teachers and parents, as well as for students. At the same time, the technological changes that we have witnessed in the last decade allow us to diversify and adapt training to current realities, including online environments where cyberbullying can take on dimensions that many children are not prepared for. Thus, the creation of a MOOC seems the most appropriate and dynamic way to teach and prevent bullying in times of a pandemic. Supported by a panel of experts, this study aims to answer clearly and objectively the following research questions: i) What types of MOOC exist in the scope of bullying in Primary Education and the respective platforms for its distribution? How can this type of training contribute to teacher training? What characteristics can we include to improve or innovate the structure of a new MOOC?",

This article presents an approach to customize explanations of decisions using a graph to mediate inferences. Proofs of concept and analysis of simulated decisions are presented.

For most organizations the priority was to get the implementation up and running, and many had to postpone verifying their compliance to security and privacy regulations. In 2021 the security of these online frameworks is better, but their privacy which depends on the behavior of users must be improved. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May 2018, resulting in European citizens getting more rights and increased transparency on how their data can be collected and processed. Organizations must inform their users what they will do with their data before it is collected/processed and how individuals can keep their privacy and security. In this work we analyze what higher education institutions in Portugal must do to comply with GDPR when using online frameworks for Distance Teaching and Learning. We also analyze the results of a questionnaire distributed to higher education students showing how informed they are about maintaining their security and privacy when using distance teaching and learning frameworks.",

In this way, and so that the process of visualisation and subsequent analysis of the data is less time-consuming and complex, we resort to the development of dashboards to visualise the most relevant information in a single layout. Microsoft Power BI was used to develop the project, transform the data and build the dashboard. We built three dashboards, based on various interactions that allow us to analyse the allocation of funds by year, by category, by thematic objective, and by municipality. Once the dashboards are built, the information provided on them is an added value for decision making, especially in the RAM.",

However, the lack of wide application prevents these objectives from being fully achieved. This article aims to evaluate and publicize various Business Intelligence initiatives in the Portuguese Public Administration and their contribution to improving the performance of the PA, such as, for example, by reducing bureaucracy, by allowing simplified access to indicators, by automating some operations, among others. The methodology used is the analysis of scientific articles available in reference databases, such as Scopus and B-on. This work intends to contribute to a greater perception of Business Intelligence in the Portuguese Public Administration in the last ten years. Thus, it is possible to understand that although BI is necessary to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, there are still areas where BI has a lack of application.",

Since this granularity is not visible to the end user, it is difficult to assess the whole system behaviour. This paper proposes the use of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) technique on software development based on microservices architecture, by building test scenarios written by non-technical users and developing automated tests on API REST services layer, enabling the ability to match system results to end-user needs. Using a real scenario of a pay roll system, the applicability of the Behave BDD tool was assessed for acceptance tests automation.",

The new technologies thus came to promote and encourage the practice of regular physical activity, for all age groups, through the use of devices and applications properly programmed to improve the individual's physical condition, and to empower its user to acquire good and lasting results. Smartwatches are a great example of devices that promote physical activity, enhancing the fight against physical inactivity, offering all the necessary tools for its development and consequently allowing its user to achieve greater success, always based on the preferences of its user. In order to modify and dismantle the paradigms of gyms and fitness studio, smartwatches have come to encourage its user to perform any type of physical activity regardless of the environment that surrounds them. Thus smartwatches, not only help in the implementation of a healthy lifestyle, breaking the barriers built by sedentary behaviors, but also seek to establish a healthy and lasting routine. This article presents a study, with data collection through a questionnaire, through which it was found that, despite society's sedentary behaviors and resistance to the implementation of a healthy lifestyle, the existing technology favors the use of devices that help promote the user's physical activity.",

    "abstract": "The present competitive marketplace, significant development of information technology, increase of customer expectations, and economic globalization, has caused a huge impact on the way companies and the different business sectors manage data produced from their daily operations. Supply chain professionals are being faced with an explosive increase in the amount of data being generated and this is causing them to struggle to handle such an enormous amount of data to accomplish a more productive, flexible, and cost-efficient way of manufacturing and delivering products. The current situation that supply chain professionals are in has created the need to acquire, develop and adapt to new mechanisms that can efficiently help with the evaluation and interpretation of excessive volume of data. The implementation of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is now serving as a powerful strategy that companies and supply chain professionals can use to solve this issue. There is a variety of means provided by big data analytics that can be used to obtain useful information from a large volume of data. The present work seeks to explore how big data analytics is performing in the context of Supply Chain Management (SCM). This research begins with the fundamentals of supply chain management and big data analytics, followed by the implementation of BDA in the different areas of SCM, and then benefits of big data on supply chain management are presented. Finally, issues and challenges of adopting and practicing BDA and future trends are also discussed.",

Two systems are analyzed in Simulink, which allowed to study of the impact of the movements of a two-axis system and simulates how energy was generated in a solar panel, for which mathematical models were considered based on inductance, capacitance, and power. and solar radiation. In addition, a 2-axis mobile solar panel prototype was designed, with which real values were obtained about the resulting power and voltage in order to compare them with a power generation system to which average solar radiation and temperature were assigned. It is concluded that this type of panel allows to maximize the collection of solar energy, and these can be an alternative in mobile scenarios where the movement of the sun affects its performance.",

It is based on theories of connectivism and constructivism, with a constructivist paradigmatic vision, a mixed approach, a nonexperimental design and a descriptive scope. Participants were 562 university students enrolled in the School of Communications of a private university in Lima, Peru. PLEs were measured with the Competencies for Lifelong Learning based on the use of PLEs (CAPPLE), while qualitatively they were analyzed through interviews. Among the findings, it was found that 52.2% of the female students mostly use PLEs. Though 90% of students prefer to use virtual environments, only 32.2% usually interact with teachers. In terms of students' digital competencies, the ability to solve problems related to the use of technology, identification of inappropriate behaviors and digital protection, as well as the recognition of limitations in the complex handling of technology stand out. According to the findings, it is considered necessary to implement programs and tutorials related to virtual learning spaces for teachers.",

    "abstract": "University academics reported having high levels of stress due to their functions and responsibilities. Universities demand academics a more in-depth preparation and commitment to their academic trajectory. The Official Mexican Norm NOM-035-STPS-2018 aims to establish the elements to identify, analyze and prevent psychosocial risk factors, and promote a favorable organizational environment in the workplace. This paper presents a recommender system to support the application of the Norm NOM-035 for identifying the level of psychosocial risk factors in university academics. The recommender system provides recommendations based on the risk factors' levels and academics' characteristics. The recommender system's ultimate goal is to provide relevant information to the university executive staff to support a better-informed decision-making process regarding the policies and programs to manage high levels of psychosocial risk factors.",

Given this, various international organizations, supported by member governments, they have sought to reduce them.This proposal is almost five decades old, initially it arises from the World Health Organization (WHO) and was recently taken up in 2010 by the World Bank (WB) in its text \"Digital dividends for all\", for the region it is reflected in the Digital Agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean. Likewise, in Mexico with the same name, a strategy for its implementation and development is formed in five specific sectors of development; for the above, this article aims to analyze the progress and setbacks of the proposal to link digital networks with respect to improvement in health services in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "The Implanted Medical Devices (IMD) industry has grown over the past few decades and is expected to grow in the coming ones. Being an asset for the health and quality of life of a patient, the availability of IMD-related products, their increasing complexity and advances in communication capabilities do not seem to have been seamlessly accompanied by cybersecurity concerns. Recent IMD can be integrated in the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) and thus, they are also exposed to attacks impacting on privacy and, above all, on the health and even the life of the device users. While in an early stage of the IMD development, the security procedures were based on the existing classic protocols and models and their functional capabilities were the focus of development, recent efforts have been made to address security from the start. In this paper we review the most recent contributions on the cybersecurity of IMD products and we highlight innovative ideas that represent new design and development paradigms of these devices next generations. In this review it is reinforced that the technological evolution and the progressive access of attackers to resources capable of exploiting multiple vulnerabilities can have a crucial impact in the IMD already implanted in the patient's body, designed to remain in operation for many years. Also, it brings the need to develop novel and robust protocols to guarantee security compatible with constrained computing resources and extremely low energy requirements to be feasible. Finally, the security and privacy concerns regarding this kind of devices should be addressed in the design phase and policies must move from damage mitigation to threat prevention.",

Currently, the maturity associated to the existent information systems and technologies are responsible for the evolution of the classic Delph method into a Real-Time Delphi method (RTD). It basically reduces to one the characteristic formal rounds associated to the classical method and shortens the time required. These new features lead to a growing interest and use of Real-Time Delphi questionnaires by researchers and professionals. Although this is a recurrent trend, it is not possible to identify the existence of a non-proprietary online survey creation solution with features to allow generating and applying Real-Time Delphi questionnaires. In this context and to respond to a research need it was necessary to develop a technological adaptation of the software LimeSurvey, an open-source online questionnaire management system to be able to create three RealTime Delphi questionnaires. These three questionnaires will allow the conception of a pairing model amidst food and beverage. To achieve the proposed objective, we used a literature review related to the Real-Time Delphi subject and the methodology of Design Science Research which will result an artifact, in this case an adaptation of LimeSurvey for the creation of Real-Time Delphi questionnaires. The results from this work are an adaptation and utilization of the open-source code from the LimeSurvey software and the creation of three RTD questionnaires for research purposes in the creation of a pairing model amidst food and wine.",

    "abstract": "Web development is one of the ways to contribute to the digitization of organizations. However, being a relevant area, it has the contribution of countless companies and people worldwide. This high number of contributions necessarily leads to several trends and forms of development. This article explores one of these trends, namely the use of react on the frontend and nodejs on the backend. In terms of the data flow between the frontend and the backend, the GraphQL specification was used. The database is supported by Postgresql. The architecture and organization of development is crucial to find generic baseline sequences that support cross-cutting development between different information systems. This was the focus of the development in order to easily change the data structure and reflect this change in the frontend, without the need for maintenance in the code. This is a key step to allow the next stage, namely the development supported by advanced techniques based on artificial intelligence (this stage is under development and will be described in a next article by the authors).",

    "abstract": "The Global Software Development has brought an opportunity to software companies to expand the business and market share, also given them the possibility of work with geographically dispersed teams, capitalizing on the advantages of this approach. However, this manner of developing software creates some new challenges, for instance, there is a lack of a formal and normalized model of a software project's data, and artifacts available in a coherent and easy access way for all members involved. The lack of this model makes it difficult for the project members to communicate, understand each other and what is specified on the project's artifacts. Then, this paper proposes a knowledge management tool that utilizes a domain-specific ontology for distributed development environments, intending to help distributed teams to overcome the challenges delivered by the distributed software development model, proposing techniques and best practices. The main result of this research is an ontology-based system to support the software development process with distributed teams.",

In the face of rising network traffic and stricter application demands, a better understanding is needed on how ISPs should manage their resources, and likewise how applications need to act, so the Internet of the future can run accordingly to user and provider needs. As a solution, the main focus of this work is the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization working group, which was formed by the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore standardizations for network information retrieval. This paper firstly begins with an introduction of the historical tussle between applications and network providers. It then presents the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization project as a viable solution in the form of an implemented system, inspired and extending the original working group’s specification, and then validates its usefulness in a simulated scenario, when compared to classical alternatives.",

    "abstract": "In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile applications have been widely used and promoted to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. Many countries have proposed these applications with the aim of improving contact tracing and thus helping \"flatten the curve\" of infection case numbers. However, even though there were many campaigns to promote the use of these apps, their adoption was relatively low, which significantly affected their success. The success of COVID-19 contact tracing apps, in terms of its massive use and effectiveness, seems to have been deeply affected by issues associated with privacy and anonymity and the perception that its potential users have about the cost/benefit. In this paper, we analyze some applications for monitoring and contact tracing of infectious diseases to identify the most common approaches and features. We then proceed to discuss the challenges and risks that may influence the success of this type of applications, and we present some recommendations that can contribute to improve their acceptance. Considering the proposed recommendations, we describe the main features and the development of an app that includes additional functionalities alongside the contact tracing feature, in order to increase user perceived value from the use of the application.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making regarding performance issues requires computer systems monitoring at any level of service provisioning. However, most of the available tools do not always allow flexibility, or when it does, it impacts directly the resource consumption through an intrusive methodology. This paper presents the UNAME tool, which proposes the automatic generation of Shell scripts for monitoring computational resources. Through a GUI, the user can drag in or out the components to be evaluated. The Linux monitoring commands were mapped to high-level representations of the computational resources, and now the user, through little interaction or knowledge about scripting, can generate their own scripts to monitor the required system resources. To demonstrate the UNAME tool feasibility we provide a case study and an evaluation scenario. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool.",

    "abstract": "The closure of schools caused by the pandemic situation and the consequent transition to distance learning during the first confinement starting in March 2020 and now during the second term of 2020/2021, exposed the schools, students and families to enormous challenges and countless difficulties. This scenario motivated the implementation, by schools, of numerous strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of this confinement in terms of student learning and their involvement with the school.In this context, an innovative pedagogical experience is presented in this article, in terms of the assessment of students' learning, which has been running since January 2019 in a school on the 2nd and 3rd cycles and secondary in the Porto area. This experience implies the frequent use of formative assessment quizz with automatic correction and immediate feedback to students, parents and teachers. The intensive use of this pedagogical tool during periods of distance learning, in this educational context, had a positive impact in terms of students' commitment as well as their involvement and interconnection with the school and teachers, mitigating the negative effects of distance learning. at these school ages and levels. In this article, this pedagogical tool (micro-evaluations) is described in more detail, giving an account of its main characteristics, functionalities and the database architecture that supports it. The main figures for the implementation of this experiment and some of the preliminary conclusions that can be drawn from this study are also presented. Being a pedagogical tool with proven effect in terms of students' learning and its functionality and web connection, it becomes particularly useful in the school context, both in terms of distance and face-to-face teaching, leading to the discussion of the future challenges of using tools online in school context.",

It then develops on the contextualization of the implementation of digitalization strategies regarding museum’s collections in Portugal and its struggles both to implement these strategies as well as to invest in the creation and implementation of applications of digital tools for audience’s engagement. Following some examples that have been developed for different purposes such as preservation, cataloguing, education and teaching, in different fields of cultural heritage such as archeology, ethnology, natural and historical sites, the article will then focus on the contributions of the more recent uses of technology to enhance or create interactive heritage experiences in cultural heritage, such as, photogrammetry, 3D modelling, and movement analysis. Finally, the last part of this article explores a proposal of gamification of intangible cultural heritage, portraying the winter festivity Carnival of Podence inscribed, in the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, in December 2019.",

Knowing the characteristics and features of the hotel units operating in Portugal is important for all those who make decisions about investment in this sector. Knowing the reality of brand affiliation of Portuguese hotel establishments is also a matter of great interest for hoteliers in supporting strategic decision-making. Performing the analysis of the universe of hotel establishments in Portugal, their characterization is made concerning their features, facilities and equipment. In addition, the reality of brand affiliation of Portuguese hotel establishments is analyzed and discussed through a logistic regression model. The results allow us to conclude that just over a third of hotel establishments in Portugal are brand affiliated and they are mostly located in the more touristic regions. The results also show that brand affiliated hotel establishments have, on average, a greater number of stars, greater capacity and a greater number of facilities than non-brand affiliated hotel establishments.",

    "abstract": "The decrease in the prices of available technology for self-generation from solar energy, and the high environmental cost of traditional electricity generation systems, have led people in the context of climate change to generate their own energy to meet their consumption needs. For the electricity system at a strategic level, this has brought with it a series of challenges in terms of planning and projection of demand and its decreasing evolution over time, which suggests a technological challenge, especially when large cities or remote communities coexist. This article presents a methodology based on anomaly detection techniques for the characterisation of atypical changes in the behaviour of a time series of energy consumption, in order to identify the installation of self-generation devices by solar panels in a study area. The methodology analysed is based on mainly on two development trends : the first makes use of the anomaly detection algorithms available in the Prophet - Facebook library, while the second uses a series of exhaustive search algorithms to determine atypical changes in the data. The results obtained show the changes in the behaviour of the time series as a result of the integration of these technologies in electricity generation, and where the time interval of analysis plays a determining role in this process.",

Semantic annotation in corpus linguistics is often included into every lexical unit of the corpus using a word labelling tool. Resources such as lexicons or ontologies are very useful for this purpose. However, current sizes of these resources for languages different from English are not always appropriate. This paper proves that an updated version of an existing NLP baseline can be extended for different domains and, as a consequence, it is able to improve Spanish token accuracy by up to 30% in comparison with using only a small lexicon.",

The use of portable thermal camera equipment for temperature measurements in the human skin is nowadays a reality. This work aims to present an automatic method to skin temperature classification using image processing, investigating the potential role of temperature changes in skin inflammation. Infrared thermography (IRT) was used to assess the thermogenic response of the hand skin. Characteristics of the map temperature distribution in some anatomical regions of the hand were collected. The tests were realized to demonstrate the potential of using image processing to identify and define specific regions of temperatures and their characteristics. The thermal information provided by these imaging systems can be used for monitoring purposes, as some previous research demonstrated. However, to develop more accurate algorithms, larger training and testing sets must be used.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the perceptions of university students about the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS) on Instagram (IG), which is the main profile of the country’s government on the platform. Young people are the largest audience of this social media (SM), which has been considered as a tool to promote public health. Therefore, this study aims at identifying how young adults perceive the content available in @sns_pt regarding health and well-being topics. The qualitative methodology was used, and a survey was carried out with undergraduate students from the University of Aveiro. It was applied digitally in June 2020, 90 days after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the new coronavirus pandemic. The survey presents 15 questions, divided into three axes: consumption of SM, use of IG, and posts evaluation. A total of 39 valid questionnaires were obtained. The sample is made up of students between the ages of 19 and 45 years old, being 61.5% female and 38.4% male. The results obtained show that @sns_pt is known by 43.5% of the respondents and 12.8% follow the account. Also, 10.2% reported having accessed the profile for the first time after the pandemic started. The posts focused on images attracted the attention of students, as well as the contents regarding the users’ routines.",

We address an Engineering problem about the mentioned equipment, and, in our approach, congregate the Web and various computer languages: PHP, Python, Fortran. A restricted objective of the study is, using common theory, to compute that coefficient, taught in Engineering courses and key to the design of a cooling tower, and to attract students to computing. A broader goal is to call the attention both to the use of the Web for scientific computing, and to many students' limitedness. This study is an example of web-based computing, which uses the same executable programs as classic computing, the hard task in Engineering and other areas. A remarkable advantage of this approach, which we think little explored, is the ease of access, thus also facilitating the desirable collaboration between academia and industry in the current context of fluent communication.",

This data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation, mean difference, and multiple linear regression analyses. It was found that Facebook is the social media application that assures higher audiences, followed by LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, in the given order. It was also found that the number of faculty members, being a university, and being in coastal mainland are relevant determinants of the total number of followers of Higher Education Institutions in social media. When combined, these determinants explain 62,5% of the variability of the total number of followers. Taking this result into consideration, a ranking of the institutions according to how well they perform compared to what could be expected based on the identified determinants is also presented.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this research is to discuss the possible impacts and mitigation measures that emerged in the retail sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a qualitative and exploratory case study of a Portuguese logistic operator, we explored the effects of the pandemic on employees daily work. To that end, we used several sources of data collection, such as semi-structured interviews, analysis of official documents and direct observation. The results showed that the logistic operator is adopting several measures and practices to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, such as: 1) use of telework; 2) protection and hygiene measures for employees and customers; 3) tools to respond to growing demand for non-perishable goods, hygiene/cleaning products and tobacco; 4) policies that enhance digital transformation; and, 5) the use of active and preventive communication strategies. Of all the adopted measures, we highlight the digital transformation, due to its potential positive impact in allowing the return of a new normal. This normality is largely achieved by the use of innovative technologies that allowed remote work in practically all departments of the organization. This organizational change improved the paradigm we were used to, as it allowed to build new beliefs regarding the positive impact of teleworking and other opportunities for remote work, without significantly changing the expected service levels. In short, this article contributes to the dissemination of measures and practices adopted by retailers in Portugal, without neglecting the safety and competitiveness of labor practices.",

    "abstract": "Information fusion methodologies are one of the most relevant issues at the core of multimodal systems. More than the simple juxtapositions of various sensory modalities at the interface, their possible synergistic combinations should be considered, in order to overcome individual weaknesses and obtain the sum of their expressive forces. The current paradigm in the association of data in interactive processes of a multimodal nature proposes the existence of three relevant aggregating levels: the level of fusion of characteristics - early fusion; the level of fusion of semantics - late fusion; and a hybrid fusion, that implies the simultaneous use of the fusion levels of characteristics and semantics. On the part of most top authors, there is a frequent disregard for the potential of the association of raw signals, immediately after their acquisition - the so-called (early fusion), notably when coming from different modalities or input channels. This article proposes to clarify, through literature review, the importance of this type of fusion for the integration of subjectivity in the scope of artistic explorations, so that one can consider combinations of creative scope that contemplate error as a form of communication and expression.",

NBA2K18 is a series of basketball video games developed by Sega Dreamcast. This study is positioned in the interpretative paradigm with a qualitative methodology. For data collection, the technique used was the participatory observation. As a result, it was evidence that the different participating brands in NBA2K18 have mimicked with the game storytelling in the players' self-realization process. They have applied both dynamic and static in-game advertising formats throughout the game. Brands have managed to be part of the narrative; this result would have been completely different if they had created a game from scratch as proposed by the advergaming model.",

Specifically, results showed significant differences between the two groups in several measures of severity, namely in Percentage of Correct Consonants (PCC) and Percentage of Correct Vowels (PVC), as well as in the percentage of occurrence of phonological processes. These findings show that the use of the APAT allows not only a deeper understanding of the phonological characteristics of Portuguese children with typical and atypical language development, but also to support professionals in the identification/diagnosis of these children and in the planning of the intervention.",

Through the design and modeling of an equity crowdfunding platform that uses a deconcentrated ledger to record the transactions that took place there, with the capacity to load and execute smart contracts, it was possible to verify that blockchain technology can create value in this type of platform, being able to mitigate or even solve some of the problems associated with this type of crowdfunding.",

    "abstract": "In a society immersed in innovation and technology, the evidence that the smartphone can take the world to school and transport school to the world is undeniable. Therefore, the use of mobile applications can stimulate the student's motivation and involvement and thus contribute to the creation of new teaching and learning contexts and instruments. Students use smartphones on a daily basis and these can be an incentive for new and creative pedagogical practices. This article describes the development of an app for Android and IOS smartphones, whose goal is to create a repertoire of apps that can be used in the classroom. It is intended that this mobile application will provide teachers with relevant information about the apps that others are using, while allowing to discover, install, try and use them, in the context of the classroom and, at the same time, evaluate them and share examples of good practices in their use. Teachers will also be able to suggest new apps thus contributing to a constant updating of the repertoire.So as to achieve this objective, we turned to IONIC CORDOVA to develop the app, enabling its installation on IOS and ANDROID and its use as WEB APP for the remaining operating systems.",

In this model, the product ceased to be the main actor, and the service started to assume this role, with the internet being its means of access. In this scenario, SaaS-Qual is used as a way to establish instruments to mediate service quality. In this work, we present a model for measuring SaaS continuity intention by assessing the quality of service used by the user. Structural equations were used, and the proposed model is a refinement of the SaaS continuity intention model proposed by Benlian and information system quality assessed by DeLone & McLean's user satisfaction. The model was able to explain that the quality variables make up 45.4% of User Satisfaction, which added to the Perceived Utility explains 37.9% SaaS Intention of Continuity.",

It became urgent to respond to the pandemic, particularly in terms of teaching and learning. One of the first options taken by higher education institutions was to implement non-face-to-face teaching, also called remote emergency teaching. The objectives of this research are to identify students' perception of the frequency of use of digital tools and assess the level of satisfaction on the use of these tools. The study is essentially of quantitative nature. Data were collected through a questionnaire from a sample of 677 students from a Portuguese public higher education institution. From the results, it is highlighted that during the pandemic the use of the tools: Colibri / Zoom and Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) was very frequent. In a post-pandemic scenario, the tools that will have the most preference for use will be VLE and email. Regarding the satisfaction with the use of digital tools during the pandemic, the tools with the highest level of satisfaction by students were: VLE, Colibri / Zoom, email and Office 365. It was also found through the analysis of the correlation among the variable's frequency of use and satisfaction that the higher the frequency of use of digital tools is, the higher is the level of satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of our PhD project is to propose a methodology that can be widely applied to determine the monetary value of a Datum in a Big Data environment. In order to define our problem, we started by investigating how monetization in those environments have been suggested in academic literature. By observing the results, it was possible to conclude that little attention has been given to the dimension Value in academic studies related to Big Data when compared to researches directed to the other three classical dimensions (Volume, Velocity and Variety). More specifically, in terms of economic value, studies are even scarcer, and the existing ones do not share a common view on how to measure this value. Bearing that in mind, we have drawn our hypothesis that it would be possible to develop a data-driven methodology (quantitative methods based on artificial intelligence) that could highlight the monetary value of a data asset (value dimension) taking into account the different applications, contexts and scenarios related to those data. We applied a formal process of systematic literature review based on the methodology suggested by Kitchenham to find out what methods have been applied to determine the relevance and value of data in these environments and if these methods are based, in any way, on information theory. The results showed that, in spite of the progress made on the topics of Big Data and the application of analytical methodologies over the last decades, there is no method based on data that is widely used to determine the value of a datum in a Big Data environment. If, on the one hand, monetization in Big Data environments is still a field that needs to be better explored in academic literature, on the other hand, these intangible assets, i.e., data, grow exponentially and are more and more present in the corporate world. It highlights the opportunity to develop studies in search of standards that can be widely accepted and used to this end. We have now finished 12 moths on this research (1st year).",

    "abstract": "The context of the pandemic we experienced, caused by COVID-19, implied the adoption of several measures, in an attempt to limit its dissemination. Among which, there is social isolation and the prohibition of visits to institutionalized elderly people. These measures favor the worsening or onset of mental illnesses in the elderly, including depression. As a way to reduce these consequences, video calls began to be made in the institutions so that users could see and talk to their family/friends. For the realization of video calls, the informal caregivers began to request the WhatsApp application, because it is currently the most used application in this context. This is how we get to the question of this study: Is the digital application WhatsApp adapted for the institutionalized elderly population? This study then aims to: to know the opinion of the elderly about WhatsApp; identify the advantages, obstacles, limitations pointed out by them about this application; reduce the infoexclusion among the elderly population; stimulate the creation/maintenance of digital social networks; decrease consequences of the isolation caused by COVID-19. The methodology adopted for this study was qualitative, being an Exploratory Case Study, based on descriptive logic. A non-probabilistic convenience sample was selected, composed of 5 subjects institutionalized in an institution of Idanha-a-Nova. For data collection, a characterization questionnaire was applied, and the participant was observed in the interaction with WhatsApp, during which the field notes and observation grid were registered and finally the Focus Group technique was used. It was concluded that the application and the equipment itself are not adapted to the institutionalized elderly belonging to this study, mainly due to the difficulty in accessing effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.",

However, the existence of national regulatory and quality control agencies (A3ES, ANECA) allows, in some way, to guarantee some systematization in the, for example, programming languages choices that each course can and should have. On the other hand, the software industry's pressure in conditioning programming languages to be taught in higher education institutions is another problem to be considered. The stress carried out by the reference organizations, supported by the national regulatory agencies and the software industry's pressure, does the exercise of adopting programming languages, quite complex. The objective of this article is to portray how Iberian Peninsula countries and hits higher education institutions have organized themselves to respond to the needs of professionals with competences in Computer Engineering, namely in terms of offering courses for students, but also in terms of programming language option chosen as initial, as well as the sequence of initial languages.",

This paper investigates dependability metrics and performs sensitivity analysis for data center networks with different redundancy levels.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a PhD thesis proposal about agile governance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of software development. Agile adoption at the team level is now mainstream. However, many organizations continue to use traditional approaches to govern agile teams. This phenomenon, known as organizational type mismatch, has been found to have harmful effects on organizational performance and team morale. Although there are some solutions, they mostly focus on large organizations, while the SMEs domain remains unaddressed. This research proposes lightweight agile governance guidelines for software SMEs. To do this, we follow the design science framework to 1) harmonize the CMMI V2.0 governance practices with SAFe 5.0 practices; 2) contextualize the harmonization result for software development SMEs; and 3) apply a mixed-methods strategy to assess whether and, if so, to what extent our guidelines help SMEs to address the organizational type mismatch and reduce its impact.",

These changes have acted as incentives, forcing financial institutions to reassess their strategic plans in a context of promoting operational excellence and improving the quality of services provided. In this context, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has been in high demand by organizations that aspire to restructure their operations in the context of digital transformation projects. This article aims to provide a literature review on the subject under study and, later, to propose a first initiative of a framework that allows evaluating the key factors for a successful implementation of RPA technology, at the level of three dimensions of analysis, management, organization and technology. Additionally, it should be emphasized that it is not the objective of this article to define the final dimensions necessary for an implementation, but rather to propose a starting point for that same exploration.",

Some models for the understanding of this period have been built upon written vestiges and some others raised from the archaeological record, thus establishing parallel but disconnected discourses that, actually, interpret and theorize about the same concepts. Our research aims at providing the essential mechanisms that would permit scholars (re)construct this past, thus creating a common ground for information (that is traditionally) gathered and organized from different disciplines. In defining them, the main elements of data modelling and historical information management will be highlighted in order to address the formation of Castilian Feudalism phenomenon at the Upper Arlanza Basin (Burgos, Spain).",

We obtained a high speed up respect to a normal parallel implementation, solving hard puzzles, using either CPUs or GPUs in different cases.",

It is extremely relevant for organizational management that this flow can be managed efficiently and effectively. It was considered pertinent study the impact that an implementation of a business process management system (BPMS) has in terms of increasing the processes maturity. For this investigation, it is important to use a model that allows establishing evaluation requirements and, with all its recognition, the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) affirmed itself as the ideal choice to assess which practices the organization implements and how is there a distinction between the system that involves the exchange of e-mail messages and the BPMS. The results obtained by comparing both tools (email and BPMS) corroborate the advantages of implementing the process-oriented solution since its users, who previously used email, identify that it promotes growth in terms of processes through the practices. Combined with an organizational culture receptive to this type of technology, BPMS presents a varied range of benefits compared to the option previously used at the institution under study.",

The project involves the implementation of a cloud platform that facilitates data analysis in a distributed, collaborative and secure form. This platform will enable efficient data ingestion, administration, analysis, visualization and export. The development will be a solution oriented to VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) environments. The implementation integrates tools and resources supported by technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) integrating models, predictive algorithms and dashboards that enable decision making based on real and meaningful data. The project proposes the use of a neuro-hybrid model, based on a SIR model with artificial intelligence, combining several algorithms. This initiative aims to support the health authorities of the Panamanian public administration by facilitating decision making and the adoption and implementation of precise strategic actions in the field of health and public welfare.",

They have a decentralized management, are flexible and versatile but their characteristics are in turn their main weaknesses. This work introduces a preliminary analysis of the evolution, trends and the state of the art in the context of the security in ad hoc networks. To this end, two different methodologies are applied: a bibliometric analysis and a Systematic Literature Review. Results show that security in MANETs and VANETs are still an appealing research field. In addition, we realized that there is no clear separation of solutions by line of defense. This is because they are sometimes misclassified by the authors or simply there is no line of defense that totally fit well with the proposed solution. Because of that, new taxonomies including novel definitions of lines of defense are needed. In this work, we propose the use of tolerant or survivable solutions which are the ones that preserve critical system or network services in presence of fault, malfunctions or attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this study we developed a novel method to detect cashew trees in an orthophoto map derived from images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We also suggest a way in which these detections can be used to analyze the yield of the cashew farm. The proposed method uses image analysis to find the tops of trees, to merge different tops located on the same tree, and to segment individual tree. The segmented trees are used in a deep learning framework to know the exact location of cashew trees. The preliminary cashew detection from UAV-based map is promising. This study can be interesting for developing countries where UAV system are nowadays gaining popularity in agriculture. Our method does not require any additional sensor other than the RGB camera onboard the UAV. This low-cost solution is suitable for small and medium cashew farmers. The developed method can also be extended to other types of trees, other than the cashew.",

In context, this study aims to analyze the management of Ecuador's government communication on Twitter during the state of exception due to the COVID-19 pandemic, observing the communicative reality of the Ecuadorian Emergency Operations Committee in its three official accounts (@ComunicacionEc, @MinGobiernoEc and @Riesgos_Ec). For this, a mixed approach methodology is outlined that is applied in two stages: in the first, through the Fanpage Karma tool, eight indicators are extracted that allow measuring the performance, impact and commitment generated in the audiences; and, in the second, through direct observation, six variables are collected from which the communication issued through the aforementioned social network is characterized. The results show an average performance in communication 2.0, as well as an absence of optimal engagement with digital audiences, accompanied by a low use of \"hypermedia\" elements that can enhance the effectiveness of the messages broadcast.",

The present paper is a Literature Review (LR) that summarizes how DQ of healthcare data has been addressed and which methodologies were proposed. Initially 698 papers were identified, searching in five databases with two search strings. After three paper-filtering stages, 44 papers remained for full quality assessment and results extraction. The findings show that many DQ dimensions have been used for assessment, but there is no consensus in the definitions of the dimensions. For DQ improvement, the activities performed were categorized into two groups, one related with Data Governance and the other related to Data Cleaning.",

To promote the use of these vehicles a reliable, real-world close evaluation in terms of energy consumption and range is crucial. One of the most efficient and frequently adopted microscopic traffic simulation tools, simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), implements an energy estimation model that relies on vehicle and road characteristics. We conduct a comparative analysis of SUMO’s estimated energy consumption and state of charge (SOC) of a simulated battery electric vehicle (BEV) and the energy consumption of an actual 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid LE AWD. Results showed that the energy consumption model in SUMO delivers different results than the ones obtained from the real world driving experiments. These findings are discussed in this paper.",

The expenditure on R&D increases the emissions, nonetheless, renewable energy consumption does reduce CO2 emissions. As recommendation, we highlight the importance of tourism industry in the short run to reduce the CO2 emissions, however, it’s necessary to increase ecotourism because in the long run tourism might increase the emissions.",

The UTAUT model is used as a theoretical basis, to which trust in technology is added as a precedent of the intention to use e-voting. Perceptions of privacy and security are established as determinants of trust towards technology. The study was carried out with students of a Chilean university through an online survey. All the proposed constructs significantly influence the intention to use e-voting, with social influence being the factor that influences the most, followed by trust in technology. Gender acts as a moderating variable in the relationship between social influence and the intention to use e-voting, being stronger for men than for women.

The main objective of our paper is to show an evaluation of Gradior computer-based program, in terms of usability and satisfaction degree standards, for the treatment of neurocognitive deficits. The \"Satisfaction Evaluation of the Gradior centers\" questionnaire was used to measure the usability and satisfaction of the program. This research includes a multi-method analysis of information, through combination of quantitative and qualitative strategies. The evaluation made to the Gradior program by 56 professionals from different centers indicates that the tool is very useful and effective in the treatment of cognitive deficiencies. The application of factorial analysis to the questionnaire shows that are 5 factors that exceed a percentage of explained variance of 5% and with an eigenvalue higher than 2, which was considered a factor with sufficient clinical significance, hence the α value of Cronbach’s obtained in reliability study is 0.913, which shows that applied questionnaire has good reliability. In general terms, the program is satisfactory, its management and use is adequate, and it allows seeing implementation capacity in clinical environments, this being one of few studies that show this subject in field of cognitive rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The teaching processes in Software Engineering discipline have an inherent challenge in motivating students to adopt in their professional performance. This challenge involves defining new teaching strategies or redesigning existing strategies. Microlearning is an educational strategy characterized by its agility and shortness of lessons and learning units. The strategy goal is providing knowledge and skills in a more dynamic way than the traditional one. However, the implementation of this strategy requires the use of technology to facilitate its adoption. Therefore, in this work, a mobile application based on gamification is presented to promote microlearning in contexts related to Software Engineering. This application is a mobile version of the lottery or bingo game. A widely spread game, consisting of a set of cards and an indefinite number of cards randomly distributed on boards. The variation proposed as a microlearning strategy consists of the identification of concepts and definitions associated with Software Engineering. From the functional tests of the application, it is evident that it allows the teacher to plan, execute and assess the teaching-learning process and the interaction, competence, and assimilation of concepts for the students.",

Considering the evolution of gamification over the years, the need to understand its use in companies becomes a growing necessity. The goal of this research is to survey the use of gamification in the Leiria Region. Our study occurs from the fact that there is no study about the use of gamification in companies in Portugal, even if this theme presents a growing interest. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected from small, medium, and large companies in the Leiria Region. The results of the study point to the fact that gamification is not being used in the region and that companies do not know the concept. Thus, arose the need to reverse this scenario and to promote the implementation of gamification solutions in companies. For this, some proposals for this specific region are presented.",

However, the largest companies are the ones that have been more dedicated to the implementation of BI in their companies. Given that in Portugal the business mass consists of 99.9% of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), so it is necessary to understand how they may adapt to this new reality. This study aims to verify the impact and practicality of BI applications in the most common processes and activities of SMEs. The practical case of a Portuguese company will be studied, where the intention is to implement a new BI tool that will allow the budgeting of its commercial proposals to be fully adjusted to the market and its target customers, thus obtaining a competitive advantage concerning your competitors. This research work aims to contribute to SMEs, in distinct business areas, but, in particular, for the construction companies, to demonstrate that, by using company data and open data, is possible to use data visualization to a data-driven decision with the most updated data.",

The allocation of European funds is based on four thematic areas: Competitiveness and Internationalization, Social Inclusion and Employment; Human Capital and Sustainability and Efficiency in the Use of Resources, covered by 16 programs that act in alignment with the goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy. This article aims to demonstrate the applicability of Business Intelligence tools, through a qualitative analysis of projects financed by European funds in the Autonomous Region of Madeira. For this purpose, it was considered the file of approved projects, which contained the summary associated with each, and using the Python language it was possible to extract the keywords of each one. Through this analysis, it was possible to analyze the most common keywords in all projects within these 4 thematic areas. This work is thus a contribution to a better knowledge of the funds approved for the Autonomous Region of Madeira since the beginning of this support program.",

The methodology is quantitative, qualitative, descriptive and relational through content analysis and expert interviews. For the content analysis, data will be collected between November 2020 and January 2021 regarding news or information where key words related to the concept of citizenship appear. The manifestations of communicational citizenship are expressed in conventional forms. The informative coverage does not advance at the same pace as social demands, there is a risk of not making social groups visible and indirectly avoiding contributing to the quality of democracy in Ecuador.",

This research specifically analyzes the possibilities that Ecuadorian producers and actors have with these business models of on demand platforms and local promotion and exploitation strategies. The semi-structural interviews that were used as part of the qualitative methodology, investigated two aspects: the relationship with creators and local companies and the relationship with international audiences. The study concludes that the economic factor is one of the challenges that Ecuadorian producers must face. The lack of public investment, with the allocation of funds for audiovisual projects decreased until the end of the year 2020.",

A controversial subject from long time [1][2][3][4][5]. Based on qualitative methodology, the main objective of this exploratory research is to understand the relationship between media and brands. There is a new context where traditional media are questioned about their significance for brands and consumers and are being pressured by the emergence of new gatekeepers, such as digital influencers. We focus on the scrutiny of two semi-structured face to face interviews with journalists who write about the automotive industry. At the end, the information is examined according to the literature about brand management, public relations, media relations and new consumer influence dynamics. Studying the strategies, interests, and narratives from media with brands, this research tries to deliver insights about the specific nature of the information preferred by journalists during the news-making process, how they perceive the relationship with press officers and how they evaluate the influence of their work on consumers' / readers' behavior.",

A year later, in March 2021, it can be stated that those forecasts were not accurate, and that this communication tool is still alive and generating profits.This article will provide a document review intending, on one hand, to define and elaborate on the concept influencer marketing, and to explain the way it operates; and, on the other, to compile information to determine whether it is still as important as a customer relationship technique, as it was before this health crisis.",

It will be analyzed from June 1, 2017 to July 1, 2018, due to the fact that this period saw the greatest increase in the arrival of foreigners to Chile and with it the consequent increase in their appearances in the digital press.

The study reveals that the aforementioned media constructed immigrant women under a class logic, in the sense that they are classified as first and second category.",

To do this, a qualitative-quantitative approach methodology is developed, which takes as a case study the Private Technical University of Loja, UTPL. The fieldwork is divided into three stages: in the first, four in-depth interviews are carried out with directors of the Institution, to know the institutional vision on crisis management of the HEIs; in the second, through direct observation and documentary analysis, the strategic approach to digital communication is determined; and, in the third, an analysis of four variables (presence, activity, participation and engagement) of the institutional social networks, Facebook and Instagram, is carried out, in order to determine the strategy and management of digital communication in the first year (2020 ) of COVID-19 in the country. The results allow identifying, in the first instance, the view of managers on crisis management and communication. Subsequently, the dynamics of digital communication of crisis is made visible, and finally, the potentialities offered by digital communication in crisis management with university audiences, specifically students and prospects (millennials and centennials) during the research period, become apparent.",

The objective was to determine the content and use characteristics of the hypermedia elements that the Internet provides. For the analysis, 19 stations were established, which were determined through the application of a census, to later establish some variants that they present in terms of: updating of contents, formats and use of multimedia resources. To achieve this, digital ethnography was used, through the composite week; The method was completed with interviews with station administrators and managers. Among the results we obtained, it was determined that Ecuadorian stations, native to the Internet, in a high percentage do not update their content; It was also detected that they abuse three formats for their programming: interviews, news and music. Finally, it was found that they are very far from a real use of all the multimedia potential that the Internet offers; the audios are not complemented with visual resources, the stations that do so are marked. All this journey indicates that they are not yet a strong and consolidated organizational structure. The lack of a clear financing model does not allow the good initiatives they present to take off. Some of them have a temporary appearance; They become an experimentation of enthusiastic people who, taking advantage of the ease of creation and dissemination, try to undertake proposals of this type, an action that in the short term, due to lack of financial resources or ignorance in the management of an online medium, they abandon the project. However, much remains to be analyzed about the future of online radio in Ecuador.",

The survey used scales measuring attitude towards e-learning, anticipation of e-learning use after the end of the pandemic, and experience with e-learning before switching to crisis e-learning. The research was conducted between April and November 2020 and the quantitative findings are as follows: 1) The vast majority of academic teachers positively assess the opportunities arising from e-learning; 2) Two thirds of respondents indicate that blended learning is the most effective solution; 3) Almost two-thirds of the respondents state that e-learning allows all of the established learning objectives to be achieved; 4) Evaluation of e-learning is not a homogeneous phenomenon, so teachers differentiate between elements related to assessing the value of e-learning; 5) The only feature that differentiates the effectiveness of the assessment of e-learning is seniority (weak correlation); 6) More than two-thirds of respondents had no experience with e-learning before the outbreak of the pandemic; 7) Evaluation of the properties of crisis e-learning has an impact on the use of e-learning-based solutions after the pandemic.",

The period examined is from 2013 to 2020. The work advances the qualitative results of a long-term analysis on the incorporation and exercise of rights in the communication system of the Andean nation. The research questions are 1) What are the research topics and the authors referred to in the academic research on LOC? 2) Is there a guarantee or regulation approach in the academic studies of the LOC? The methodology is descriptive and relational, the techniques used are content analysis and semi-structured interviews. Based on the data of the most repeated words and expressions and the testimonies, it is concluded that a regulatory and sanctioning approach persists but not guarantees in the evidence that the researchers have explored.",

A qualitative study was the approach selected to undertake the study, as a means for understanding the meaning that individuals or groups ascribe to a phenomenon, or experience, in a particular context. Semi-structured interview was the main data collection technique chosen. Through the snowball technique and theoretical sampling, ten parents between 36 to 45 years old (all Samsung consumers) were interviewed. The evidence from this study indicates that family conditioning and new manifestations of masculinities contribute to changes in paternal representations, granting previously unseen characteristics for the construction of an empathic advertising discourse close to parents.",

Thus, based on several assumptions, an explanatory model was built that addresses both the demand side (new consumer preferences) and the supply side (measures and strategies to combat the impacts generated by the perceived risk acquired during the confinement period). In this context, in view of the results obtained, it was concluded that this crisis had a permanent impact on consumer behavior, accelerating the migration to online, with a greater emphasis on safety, hygiene and health, as well as environmental and financial awareness.",

    "abstract": "Tourism is one of the most important economic sectors for Portugal and many countries in the world. With the emergence of low-cost aviation companies, this sector's growth has been exponential. Hence, operators, municipalities, and governments have to adapt to this new world order. A part of the world population that intends to visit has some type of disabilities. On the other hand, as the development of digital platforms, namely at the level of mobile devices, here opens many opportunities to be explored in this binomial between people with disabilities, their willingness to practice tourism, and the use of mobile devices for this purpose. This article intends to present a mobile application developed that allows the practice of inclusive tourism, using google maps and using an algorithm that helps classify the level of accessibility of each point of tourist interest. Finally, it allows the person with disabilities to know at the outset whether that point is inaccessible to its characteristics.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes consumer perceptions about the use of sustainable fashion, specifically, through vintage and upcycling, as part of the branding strategy of an independent brand located within Gamarra, a commercial emporium in Peru. A qualitative methodology was carried out to analyze their perceptions regarding the chosen case of study, the Infinity Beyond brand that markets the aforementioned sustainable fashion techniques. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with female clients of the brand and also followers of the official account on Instagram. Within the branding strategy, the sustainable fashion characteristic helps to differentiate it from its competitors and position the brand, because it relates its products to attributes of sustainability and authenticity, although the public does not necessarily know the meaning of sustainable fashion.",

Exploring the five human senses and their role in the creation of experience, knowledge, and perspective has been a trending subject of discussion in different research disciplines. Studies in marketing management recognize the importance of multisensory stimuli in the formation of positive customer experience i.e., sensory marketing. In tourism studies, the assumption is that destinations, as well as products, can be branded. The destination sensory branding can stimulate positive tourist experience, memory, and contribute to local sustainable development. However, there is a lack of empirical research on multisensory experience in the context of urban tourism. A self-administered survey in three languages was collected from 305 national and international tourists who have visited Porto. A content analysis produces different sensory impressions for each sense i.e., sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The findings suggest that urban areas are rich in multisensory cues that could encourage sense and memory of a destination.",

The inclusion of the consumer in the manufacturing processes (Social Manufacturing) also raises new challenges regarding their representation. Based on three consumer satisfaction categories: (1) Perceived Value; (2) Consumer Expectation; (3) Consumer Loyalty; this work proposes a multidimensional representation of the consumer in three dimensions: (1) Personalisation; (2) Opinion; (3) Engagement. This model is based on the definition of complex networks, and the multidimensional aspect allows organisations to isolate and combine different dimensions to better understand their consumers, their opinions, and their demands for new products. The multidimensional characteristic of the model, namely the isolation and combination of dimensions, can help organisations understand if common customisation demands share common background, understand what demands should be addressed or prioritised, or even anticipate trends.",

Likewise, SR evolves in tandem with the construction of the business culture, a fundamental basis for generating business models in which ethics and good behavior become the fundamental axis for decision-making, involving groups of interest in its different dimensions. Business competitiveness is a complex issue, which must be analyzed from a comprehensive and systemic perspective, for this it is necessary to diagnose the situation of companies, which has given way to a significant interest in applying various tools that allow determining the involvement of companies. organizations with ethical practices. Ethos is a diagnostic instrument, whose methodology allows companies to incorporate concepts and commitments to sustainable development into their management. In the case of Ecuador, SR has been strengthened, since companies and organizations have become aware of the importance it has for the generation of value in an increasingly competitive market, where interest groups play a leading role in the business performance. It is the largest companies that have adopted management models with a socially responsible approach, aimed at generating a culture based on ethics and values.",

The methodology used is a probabilistic binary variable model that assumes a logistic distribution function of stochastic disturbances. The results show significant differences in favor of women who have access to ICT. With these findings, the debate for research to promote concrete proposals for reducing digital gaps between women in developing economies such as Ecuador is strengthened.",

This research analyzes the management of digital communication of public organizations in the face of natural hazards. This main objective was carried out through the exhaustive review of documentation and the observation of web portals on risk management of 20 Latin American countries. The methodology used was based on the application of an assessment scale to 20 web portals of the organizations in charge of risk management in Latin America. The results obtained show the obligation to delve into the subject of training and prevention within the branch of risk management, and the mechanisms of immediate attention for citizens in the face of a natural threat.",

Recently, however, interactive systems in which human experts actively contribute towards the learning process have shown improved performance when compared to fully automated ones. This may be so in scenarios of Big Data, scenarios in which the input is a data stream, or when there is concept drift. In this paper, we present a system for supporting auditors in the task of financial fraud detection. The system is interactive in the sense that the auditors can provide feedback regarding the instances of the data they use, or even suggest new variables. This feedback is incorporated into newly trained Machine Learning models which improve over time.",

What goes even more unnoticed is the fact that every Machine Learning model needs computational power. And of course, it also needs data. But how many data are necessary to build the best Machine Learning model possible, and how many times do we need to retrain a model so that it does not become obsolete as data change? That kind of questions are the ones that can reduce unnecessary costs to a company. In this paper we propose a novel approach to predict the performance of a model given some characteristics of the data, that are called meta-features. The goal is, indeed, to only train a new model when some error metric (e.g., RMSE) is expected to decrease substantially compared with a previously trained model. This approach is best applied in scenarios of data streaming or in Big Data, as well on Interactive Machine Learning scenarios. We validate it on a real Fraud Detection case and this scenario is also briefly described.",

In order to obtain a descriptive theoretical analysis of the proposed field of study, a rigorous and systematic SLR methodology is applied that leads to the analysis of the publications made in the last 5 years in the Scopus database. The results showed that the management of innovation and social networks are promoted mainly through co- creation practices where collaboration and knowledge of tourism actors are the keys to a more efficient management.",

Given the constant growth in the use of digital platforms by consumers, companies are increasingly turning to digital marketing and communication through digital platforms to reach their target audience. In this context, the appearance of digital influencers, evidencing a relevant role in the consolidation of many brands, has become fundamental. For many content managers, influencer marketing remains a mystery. There are no defined rules and the terrain has not yet been sufficiently explored. Thus, the purpose of our work is to ascertain the main determinants of loyalty to digital influencers, which, in turn, contribute to the purchase intention of their followers. Thus, it aims to fill a gap in research regarding the attributes of digital influencers that are deemed decisive in building loyalty to these same influencers, which drives their followers' purchase intention.",

The situation presented leads the brands to look for cheaper and safer ways to launch/sell their products. Hence the expression retro, which means that different products, services, and brands, which were used in the past, return to the present again. The success of these retro products and brands with consumers can be explained by their differentiation, by the evocation of the authentic or by a period in which things were made to last, or even by more nostalgic propensities that are felt above all in a turbulent context like the current one. The purpose of this study is to describe the different categories of retromarketing proposed in the literature, not forgetting the many examples of industries that have adopted this strategy.",

Thus, the purpose of this study is to highlight the attributes of influencers that consumers value most, favoring the purchase of a particular brand over another.",

    "abstract": "The image of a tourist destination must be worked by the various players in the tourist industry, as a way of attracting the destination, and promoted in several communication channels, namely in social media. Social networks are a source of information, content sharing and experiences by various users, and can condition the image created of a destination favorably or not. The Douro Wine Region, a World Heritage since 2001, presents itself as a tourist destination by excellence, due to its many attractions. Thus, this exploratory study aims to analyze the presence on the social networks of the destination Douro Vinhateiro and identify the dimensions of the image of the destination. To this end, a search was made for “Douro Turismo” on the social network Facebook, and the pages of four companies were analyzed. The search for the various contents resulted in three main dimensions: the Douro River, the Vineyards and the City of Porto.",

The environmental conditions that these structures continuously face are challenging and the continuous monitorization of its hydraulic stability is a key success factor for preventive maintenance of these critical infrastructures. This paper introduces the architecture of an IoT solution designed to monitor the hydraulic stability of Antifer blocks, a common building block used for breakwater infrastructures construction, by measuring, recording, processing, and communicating the data related to the displacement of an Antifer block, in a laboratory context. The IoT device has been designed to meet the following requirements: 3D displacement measurement (up to 25 mm); corrosion-proof and waterproof; wireless charging and wireless communication; and autonomy above one month. Preliminary results have shown that the SmartAntifer prototype fulfills the core application requirements and presents an average consumption of 90 mA, which results in 11 hours of autonomy when equipped with a battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh.",

The belonging-oriented consumption model explains the process that individuals follow when they consume to promote their affiliation to a group. One construct of the model is the Belonging Conduits, which are the resources in the marketplace used to display goods to others as a vehicle to signal group affiliation. How young people use the conduits in their content on Instagram, and what characteristics of the brands do they value in this activity, is unknown. This study aims to examine how young consumers use conduits when producing their content for the social network Instagram. A deductive qualitative study and thematic analysis technique was conducted using data obtained from interviews with young people of both genders. The results suggest that shared meanings referring to brands and products, and their physical and visual components that facilitate their recognition and inclusion in Instagram content, are preferred for instrumentalization as conduits.",

In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the study of the country brand, analyzing its management and determining how it is being perceived among its target audiences. The proposal is based on a bibliographic review from which it is argued that there are multiple factors that influence the effectiveness of the brand message. It was mainly determined that both the management and the reception of this message require a detailed measurement in different phases. It is concluded that the reality of a country, reflected in international news coverage, means a communication flow that flows in parallel with the brand message and that requires special attention.",

The present study proposes that the relationship between cyberactivism and offline collective action is mediated by Facebook self-efficacy to produce collective action. The sample was comprised of 293 undergraduate students (M = 19.93, SD = 1.73, women = 63.8%) from two private universities in Lima - Peru. Results showed that cyberactivism was related with Facebook self-efficacy (r = .29, p < .001) and offline collective action (r = .37, p < .001), while Facebook self-efficacy was also associated with offline collective action (r = .59 p < .001). Furthermore, the findings displayed a partial mediation of Facebook self-efficacy between cyberactivism and offline collective action (B = .19, SE = 0.5, 95%, CI [.11, .29]). The model accounted for (R2) 14% of the explained variance in collective action. Finally, results demonstrated a good adjusted model fit index (CFI = 1.00, SRMR = 0.00). The interplay between the variables can partially be explained through the concept of triadic reciprocal causation of the Social Cognitive Theory",

In this context, the concept of Continuous Assurance has been gaining prominence, allowing to reduce potential errors and risks and get useful information in real time, supporting decision-making more effectively. This study aims to ascertain the importance and the use of the Continuous Assurance services from the perspective of the internal auditors in Portugal. The methodology used is of the exploratory-descriptive type and of qualitative nature and used a questionnaire survey. The main results show, among other aspects, that the Continuous Assurance services are considered by the respondents as very important and that its implementation in organizations does not follow the importance attributed to it.",

However, there is a populist discourse when addressing some issues and within some political parties when they address certain issues. The use of populist discourse is not constant, it has variations and is applied to some issues more than others.",

The purpose of this study is to understand political interest among university students in the cities of Arequipa and Iquitos, and their use of social media. Indicators of indifference used in this study include the evaluation of political leaders, attachment to or the rejection of democracy and the political system, participation in protests, and membership in associations. Our research questions explore university students’ perceptions of authorities and institutions, as well as the type of political information they access, and their use of social media. We carried out eight focus groups, four per city, with a total of 71 students from public and private universities, ranging in age from 17 to 28 years and from the academic disciplines of the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Our principal finding demonstrates that university students have a high level of indifference towards politics, but they are not uninterested in public affairs. However, they distance themselves from political parties. They use social media as a way to access information and to mobilize, but their attitudes are not enough to impact collective political action.",

    "abstract": "Most of the literature on audit quality is at a firm and office level. Here, we analyse the influence of several auditor characteristics on audit quality, namely gender, education, education area and experience, in a European setting. Based on a sample of STOXX® 600, we find evidence that auditors’ gender and education influence audit quality, the former decreasing discretionary accruals if the auditor is female and the latter increasing audit fees for higher degrees. These results may be due to the fact that female auditors are more interested in the audit quality (being more risk averse, more intense in the cognitive process and less overconfident than male auditors) than in the aspects of the audit firm’s business. Moreover, the higher the level of education, the more knowledge auditors have to perform an audit and this is noted by the market. This study contributes to the existing literature on audit quality by studying auditor attributes and stressing the importance of gender and education in audit quality.",

Eighteen public profiles of trans young men were found, six of them were selected considering impact (followers) in the first place, but also other social characteristics. Posts of those profiles were reviewed, then 3 young men were interviewed. The information collected allows us to improve the previously defined set of categories, find certain patterns in the forms of publication and suggest that this group could have a more prosocial and political orientation on their use of Instagram than the rest of their generation.",

Therefore, a comprehensive solution, which aims to link the industrial, commercial and services sectors, based on an online platform, with automatic and large-scale adhesion, has not yet been tried. This article analyzes the need for a platform to reduce information asymmetry between people and companies, in order to minimize adverse selection in the Portuguese credit market. Encouraging good payers to have access to interest-free or lower-rate credit, ensuring that creditors have minimum conditions for risk analysis and the respective effective collection of overdue debts is the purpose of the Nice Payer system, proposed here. The article presents a scalable prototype of the proposed system, for managing negative information and whose purpose is to support the existence of a private credit bureau with multinational operations.",

The difference largely consists in the mechanisms for combating corruption and in the transparency between political relations and other economic interests. The transparency associated with the possibility of tracking \"interests\" is one of the mechanisms that can be implemented in democracy. This article, after a brief overview about how the transparency of political relations can guarantee less corruption, presents a blockchain-based platform for tracking political contacts. All the concepts involved in the platform and its development are covered in detail, and several examples are presented. The proposed platform excels in data consistency, security and immutability, demonstrating enormous reliability and transparency towards users.",

Additionally, by obtaining mobility-related data we can infer patterns, optimize mobility and strengthen more sustainable habits within academia. In this paper, we propose a secure LoRa-based tracking system for the BIRA bicycle. The BIRA bicycle is an initiative of Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo (IPVC) that aims to promote bicycle usage on campus, by encouraging the adoption of more sustainable mobility habits within the institution. The proposed system consists of BIRA bicycles equipped with low-cost GPS trackers. The collected data is then transmitted using a LoRaWAN infrastructure to an application server, which is responsible for storing and serving the client application with several contextual information, such as location, route, speed, and battery level. The results have shown that the proposed system is a viable low-cost solution for tracking bicycles and users' habits at a campus or even a city level.",

Each student has different learning goals and specific needs in relation to the level of depth and abstraction of the knowledge to be acquired. To ensure inclusive education, the development of Instructional Design must be carried out carefully to address all these differences. Inclusive education through universal perspectives provides learning for all students, respecting their limitations, whether cognitive or physical. Among the challenges in planning an inclusive course, it is possible to point out the identification of educational needs, the creation of a flexible, personalized curriculum, seeking the most appropriate communication for the student, establishing actions that optimize time for course creation and delivery. In this context, this work aims to discuss the challenges in implementing Universal Instructional Design techniques supported by digital technologies to foster inclusive education.",

Digital transformation usually implies process changes and leads to increased automation of flows, which results in many benefits. In this scenario, the use of business process management systems presents clear advantages due to the speed of implementation and, above all, the ease and rapid adjustment of digital support to changes in business processes. To concretely evaluate the benefits of adopting business process management systems in higher education, it was carried out a case study based on the implementation of an internal process on a business process management system, and the subsequent completion of a user survey. The survey, based on the ISO/IEC-25010 quality standard, concluded that the process implemented under the case study is significantly better in terms of quality of use.",

However, the inconsistency and seasonality of demand causes companies linked to the sector to encounter difficulties regarding the planning and management of resources allocated to the activity. It is often the case that there are periods of economic loss caused by a small volume of demand that is insufficient to support the costs of the activity. In this context, this article proposes a system that, based on intelligent data analysis, allows a hotel chain to segment customers and enhance exclusive offers to minimize fluctuation and demand gaps in hotel units installed in thermal instances.",

This study proposes a multi-agent solution to solve the task of electric vehicle allocation on smart grid chargers sensitive to the vehicle's base, destination and battery profile for charging convenience. In particular, we assess robustness against irrational vehicle behavior and unstable power supply. The proposal follows a design science research methodology. We consider an unstable power source and agents with emotional behaviours, such as irrational preconception of stations and individual perceptions experience. Different environments are simulated with an automatic topology engine extraction grounded on real world urban scenarios. This tool may be helpful to aid planning by simulating station distribution in a parameterizable way. The simulation results allow for a preview of the architecture performance at a system wide level considering several scenarios with distinct characteristics. The smart grid consistently manages energy delivery, leaving no cars uncharged.",

The chosen period of our investigation is particularly interesting because political parties had a chance to communicate their views during a pandemic situation and over a period of one year. These views include possible solutions to face the crisis and their comments on the development of the whole situation. Using a standard lexicon we classified the amount of particular emotions in different tweets. Using this method we plotted the average positivity and negativity along time per party. We also analyzed the impact of each emotion to classify positivity using the present corpus. Finally, we considered some important words regarding the pandemic and their average positivity score. The analysis allows us to identify different approaches to participation in social media according to different strategies, more than political ideology.",

This is particularly critical for paper based periodical publications, which circulation numbers exhibit a strong collapse of the business model. To address this crisis, mastheads need to find the complementarity of the printed and digital editions. Sports newspapers, despite having its own specialization character and complementarity with the generalist media, have not managed to avoid this structural crisis. In order to determine the actual impact of this crisis with regards to the circulation of this specialized press, a study of its evolution during the 1995-2019 period was executed. For the analysis, the Spanish most representative sport newspapers were selected, showing consistent and homogeneous results throughout the aforementioned time frame for Marca, As, Mundo Deportivo and Sport. The Office for the Justification of Circulation was used as the main source of data for this study, extracting the figures from the certifications associated with its Control Acts. Descriptive statistics techniques were used for the study. From the combined results, three relevant issues could be identified: the decline in total circulation, despite starting in 2004, showed a significant surge after 2010; the retail sale numbers per issue did not reflect any significant differences compared to generic press, concerning the loss of buyers; although the major element involved in the negative impact of this crisis was related to the fact that, during the period of the study, sport press lost around half a million copies on circulation, which represents a 37% drop.",

For this, and after a conceptual incursion into the motives of social capital and social media, the effects that the literature collects for bonding social capital (network of strong ties) and bridging social capital (network of weak ties) are analyzed, considering the influence it radiates on subjective well-being. With certain nuances, sometimes relevant, it is possible to point out a general positive influence of the social media in both spheres.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, organizations need to have innovation mechanisms, and this is due to the market constantly evolving. This ever-changing climate may cause instability within organizations, in some cases even lead them to a scenario of bankruptcy. In this case study, we analysed the unlikely success story of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). AMD is a company that operates in the semiconductor industry. A company responsible for computer processors since 1969, and more recently it went through a major change in its strategic management to survive a bankruptcy situation. Even though AMD showed a lack of adaptation throughout the years, especially when smartphones and tablets first appeared, AMD has, since then, turned their focus towards what they are fundamentally good at, and they bet on those segments, which were high performance computer components. These segments were mostly dominated by very few players, such as Intel and Nvidia. This restructuration was led by Dr. Lisa Su, as she rethought the various strategies used by the company, propelling AMD once again to the top and making it one of the market leaders in the technology industry. In this study we focused on the successful case of AMD, by understanding the type of strategy chosen by the company and how it influenced its ongoing success. To achieve this, we collected information in various ways. Regarding the gathering of information about the company, an analysis of Dr Lisa Su's interviews and the organization's website was made. After carrying out these tasks, academic articles were read to identify the approaches selected by the company. Dr. Lisa Su's management proved to be fundamental to the company's success, as her futuristic vision and her ability to bet on promising products allowed AMD not only to face its biggest competition, but also to go head-to-head against it. This study suffered some limitations in terms of data collecting since there was no opportunity to talk with the company and consequently ended up being based on the formed opinion of the authors.",

    "abstract": "Portugal will receive €66.2 billion from the European Union in the coming years, with €45 billion to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy and €21.2 billion from the next Community framework 2021-2027. But the success of allocating European funds to SMEs and the impact on the economy remains under discussion, making it urgent to find efficient and effective solutions for the benefit of the Portuguese economy. Thus, how can the earnings management combined with Analytics techniques benefit the process of allocating financial funds to Portuguese SMEs? To answer the question formulated, the Beneish M-Score model was used, in combination with data analysis and Decision Trees - CART and CHAID, with the objective of predicting the success of projects to European Union funds. The results are promising, by identifying as good predictors the Beneish M-Score indices of the success of SME investment projects at the time of application. Thus, the management bodies of the European funds gain insights into the importance that the manipulation of results can have in the approval of project applications, but not if it is subsequently reflected in this funding in successful projects.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental objective of this study is to characterise the empirical research that has been developed within the context of the relationship between foreign direct investment and taxation, covering a 15-year period (2005-2019). The research methodology adopted was the systematic literature review. In particular, the study at issue is based on the PRISMA recommendation. The results obtained reveal that the number of publications concerning the relationship between foreign direct investment and taxation has been increasing. With respect to the most investigated subject areas, it appears that the majority of researchers choose to study the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth, as well as to quantify the impact of granting tax incentives and of corporate income tax rates in attracting this type of investment. In relation to the profile of the researchers, it is possible to conclude that the most frequent type of authorship is the collective one, with many of the referred researchers being responsible for the publication of only one article. This type of study is becoming increasingly relevant among academics, as it makes it possible to conclude about the characteristics and trends of publications over time, as well as the state of the art of research.",

Thus, this research aims to observe the behavior of the best-positioned universities in these rankings, as well as the trajectories of indicators and institutions. In fact, the Top-15 universities of ARWU, THE, and QS were selected, and an analysis was carried out using the Dynamic Biplot technique, which allows the study of the relationship between a set of multivariate data developed on more than one occasion. The results prove that world-class universities show different characteristics and trajectories when analyzed multivariate and dynamically. The ranking indicators also reveal different correlations that may affect the final ranking.",

Tourism in general, and hospitality, due to its intrinsic characteristics, has been particularly influenced by this trend. In this sense, the objective of the present investigation is to understand the influence that generic and non-generic channels have on the hotel sector, both from the perspective of the entity and the consumer. To this end, data were collected on several digital channels from twelve hotels located in the city of Porto, with different star ratings. In this context, in view of the results obtained, it was clear that the content and presence vary according to the classification, being important to determine the target and the positioning that is to be reached before defining any communication strategy.",
