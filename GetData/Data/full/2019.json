    "abstract": "The use of the smartphone in today's society has been growing through the introduction of new mobile devices in the market and the rapid evolution of communication technologies. This evolution means that this mobile device almost loses its main functions of making calls and sending messages, and also acquire the functions of a computer with a low processing capacity. Much of the addition of these new features to the mobile phone was the responsibility of the telecommunications companies, as people, when acquiring a better mobile phone, make more use of mobile data. This responsibility is shared with smartphone development companies and applications to be installed on them. With these new devices on the market, and with the variety of applications available, people have a tendency to want to acquire them, since quite easily, they can perform some functions that they previously only had with a computer. This study shows the influence that the mobile phone has on people's daily lives, namely if they can make people become dependent on it, without realizing it. Thus, an exploratory study with a quantitative methodology was carried out through the application of questionnaires, and it was verified that people use the smartphone, mainly to facilitate their daily tasks.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the algorithm that shows the structure of texts, scientific or academic articles, from the theme, characteristics and actions. The first step of the algorithm is to identify all subheadings or large groups found, such as introduction, methodology, result, discussions, conclusion. With the groups identified, the next step is to find all the grammatical periods, which will be analyzed so that groups capable of describing actions and formulas can be located and assembled. Since the text, in the semantic sense, is a seam or an interlacing of words that forms a sense of information that does not obey a rule, a sequence or an algorithm of thought, it becomes necessary to standardize the description of the characteristics of the theme. In this process step, with the rules standardized and reorganized according to the algorithm, any article will be treated as if it were a computational structure, since this is one of the means to know what actions or functions the article describes, and that will be rewritten in the schema: object, property, modules and functions.",

    "abstract": "The Open Data movement, aimed at stimulating economic growth, making social changes, encouraging citizen participation and promoting new forms of government accountability, has been growing worldwide during the last decade. Following this trend, Open Data initiatives are progressively being used by governments particularly to increase the transparency of public resource investments and their outcomes. Information and Communication Technology tools combined with data analysis techniques can be used to make these Open Data understandable to anyone interested, machine-readable, reusable, and a source for improved decision support, innovation, accountability and efficiency. This paper analyzes some Open Data initiatives within the Brazilian Government in order to verify if they meet the requirements of the Open Data definition. The results indicated that those requirements were all almost fulfilled, but there are still challenges to be overcome, such as greater update frequency, better license-free specification, and effective availability of all data which can be open to citizens. These results can help governments to identify the gaps that need to be addressed and make Open Data initiatives more effective.",

The evaluated parameters involve the analysis of the first spectral peak, the Relative Power of the Periodic Component, which corresponds to a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio and the Low Band Spectral Tilt. The Low Band Spectral Tilt is proposed as optimization of the first spectral peak, to resolve the cases of classification error due to the degradation of vocal quality with the disease progression. The three parameters are evaluated in two databases. The Low Band Spectral Tilt achieves the best results, with 100% accuracy in the USP database and 83.5% accuracy in the MEEI database.",

There are some constraints in the implementation of these requirements, due to technical issues, interpretation of tax legislation or the selection of regulations or good practices in the area of Information and Communication Technologies. The objective of the paper is to present a set of concerns underlying the design of a business continuity plan, supported by current tax legislation, by standards and codes of good practice. In view of the constraints of Portuguese business capacity, it is also presented a minimum solution that meets the legal, regulatory, good practices and conceptual requirements of Information and Communication Technologies for the design of a Business Continuity Plan. The method used in this investigation was based on the analysis of international standards ITIL, ISO, CMMI, COBIT and the Portuguese legal framework in the field of invoicing. The main expected results are to foster the design of Business Continuity Plan in Portuguese companies, in order to reduce the gap between the practices currently in place and the requirements underlying certification, as a way to prepare companies to deal with disruptive events in invoicing business processes.",

The system is implemented based on distributed sensor nodes by using ZigBee technology. Several sensors were placed around the main streets on campus in order to monitor CO2concentrations. Data suggested that speed bumps generate increased levels of CO2, which are emitted by vehicles. We determine that the CO2levels in our campus are 410 parts per million, which is within tolerable limits. The wireless system developed has been used as a tool to take actions in order to reduce the environmental pollution around our university campus, and to improve traffic by removing the speed bumps or to restrict the circulation of vehicles at peak hours when the system indicates that pollution levels are high.",

The aim of this paper is to evaluate use preference in learning a software, among 8 types of help documentation (manuals, online help, articles, FAQ, interactive online tutorials, tutorial videos, online forums and training) and three help alternatives (autonomous research, search engines, asking experienced users for help). The applied methodology had an exploratory character and used a questionnaire-based data collection technique. The respondents of the questionnaire were 104 students of the Software Engineering course of the University of Brasília (UnB), Brazil. Among the results of the study, the recurrent use of each help medium, evaluated here individually, was highlighted. In this research, among the results found, it was evidenced that the respondents assigned high importance to help documentation, although they prioritized the use of alternative forms of help, such as different types of help documentation provided by third parties.",

    "abstract": "Multi-user environments are evolving in the Broadband Society. The Internet has fostered a lot of possibilities in this area. However, the addition television + Internet are a new and thrilling multi-user virtual environment, merged with the traditional audio-visual screen. Curiously, television, in terms of audience, is resisting with difficulties the push of the Internet and maintains the leadership in quantity of audience, but it is necessary to measure the virtual multi-user impact if you include advertising inputs. The debate is how to measure, in a technically adequate and efficient way, the audiences. The progressive penetration of the HbbTV (Hybrid broadcast broadband Television) standard in homes breaks the traditional patterns of audience measurement. It supposes the union between the Internet and audio-visual, so that, in interactive contents, the viewer can derive towards online contents. This raises certain situations, such as the control of the duration of the visit to an advertisement, and new decisions on the control of users. It can be considered a single visit, or segment the audio-visual metrics of the Internet. In this quantitative research the data of a survey on HbbTV in Spain is analyzed. Professionals of the sector are questioned about the way forward to some of these debates. It is concluded that the data obtained by visit of multi-users in virtual environments must be integrated, but that the minutes of follow-up through the Internet must be determined according to the rules of minutes per hour of television advertlsing.",

This work presents the design of a prototype for a smart community alarm that sends an alert in emergency cases through the use of a mobile application, an Arduino board and a GSM-GPRS module. The main contribution of this prototype is to ease the communication of events and security incidents between citizens and the relief institution. For prototype functionality evaluation, four test scenarios were designed, those scenarios represent the incidents with more frequency in the community. Further results are: response time evaluation, sound type and decibel level that must be generated according to incident type.",

In order to analyze the network, the main measures in actor level centrality and network were evaluated. Both centrality measures and clusters were generated by scripts developed in Python and R using iGraph and SNA social networking tools. This work highlights the clusters identified with the Louvain algorithm that presented high modularity when executed with a user sample that presented greater strength of connection or similarity. The cluster analysis (communities) allowed to identify the most active and influential users and each of the groups pattern of use of the system.

    "abstract": "The contribution of interaction design in improving the experience of using applications installed in the new generation of smartphone represents a research dimension of interest. The article discusses the design of a software application designed to be installed on smartphones and to be used by only one hand. Through the design of an ergonomic interface, according to the anatomy of the human hand, new forms of interaction and the use of this type of devices were studied. The study presented in this paper seeks to identify if the adaptation of people at the time of interaction is due to the dimensions of the device or if that interaction is also constrained because of design issues. Some applications present an inadequate interface, which has not evolved and does not introduce new methods of interaction for promoting interactions that require the use of only one hand. The article explores synergies between Interaction Design, Human and Ergonomic Factors, and Information Architecture. The methodology chosen for the development of this project was the Agile Design Science Research (ADSR) applied to a specific case study. The proposed solution uses service design thinking techniques with context-awareness mechanisms applied to the healthcare sector. In the context of the case study, the research challenges focus mainly on monitoring the impact of the proposed solution on streamlining the interaction of the customer-segment with the customer care service provider in the healthcare institution, using mobile devices. Such dematerialization of processes transfers customer interaction to new channels, reducing the need to travel to the institution for simple administrative processes. The value proposal, therefore, focuses on a set of services for self-management of the information necessary for the client to be able to interact more comfortably with the customer service provider in the healthcare institution.",

The first goal is to evaluate the performance of a Webservice in the cloud environment by analyzing the sending of images to mobile devices focused on social networking applications. From this evaluation, the second objective proposes strategies to mitigate the effects of delays in the display of these images, in order to optimize the quality of the service. The methodological process consisted in the planning and execution of experiments to evaluate the performance of different scenarios with different amounts of images, resolutions and database for storage. The Eucalyptus platform was defined as the Cloud environment, and a Webservice sending persistent images in NoSQL Databases to a mobile device. The results highlight that the parameter that influences the performance of the image consumption in mobile devices through the WebService is the processing of the images in the mobile device itself.

A quantitative method for the development of the research was adopted through a survey. The sample achieved a total of 153 responses. Results show that video reviews have more impact on consumers' buying decisions than text reviews, both in terms of consumer type, product type and the credibility of the review assumes a preponderant role in the development of consumer perception of product quality, thus having a greater impact on their purchasing decision.",

From this perspective, it is common that there are issues related to the development team and their need for communication, collaboration, motivation, commitment, among others.

For this reason, software companies are interested to provide solutions to this kind of difficulties that influence the productivity of the team, the satisfaction of their customers, the costs, the quality, and the time of their projects. In order to contribute with this purpose, we propose a model based on gamification to intervene social and human factors and influence the productivity of development team.

The construction industry has evolving to the use of alternative and eco-friendly materials, enhancing the sustainable growth of the cities. One of the main social problems in developing countries arises on the lack of housing at affordable prices, this is reflected as a result of a situation of poverty and exclusion of low-income communities. The present work describes the development of a novel device for the compression of plastic waste in PET bottles, also denominated eco-bricks. The device allows the compaction of plastic laminates and sachets inside bottles of different sizes. Based on a social context, the compactor device was designed for manual operation without the use of electric power, portability, ease of usage and safe operation. Another outcome of this technology is the educational strategy based on the manufacturing of eco-bricks that promotes environmental responsibility that aims at reducing pollution and the indiscriminate and non-responsible use of non-renewable resources in urban and rural environments. The device was submitted for its consideration as an invention patent and therefore granted.",

Eight prediction models were selected for adjustment and testing with 208 variables from population exceeds 15 thousand employees. These data will be extracted from the operators' profile and then filtered through correlation and variable selection processes. The selected features will be used to compare the prediction of absenteeism and productivity by the different algorithms of classification and regression (cf. RF - Random Forest, MLP - Support Vector Machine, NB - Naive Bayes, XGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting, DMM - Dummy and LSTM - Long Short Term Memory). The hyper parameterization of these ML models is also considered to evaluate which one would be the most suitable for the prediction problem.",

Some technical details of the system will be provided, along with particular aspects of a real implementation of a system prototype, which was made using the JAVA language. The robustness and usefulness of the devised solution is proven resorting to the CORE network emulator platform. Such platform allows emulating a real ISP network infrastructure, over which a prototype of the proposed overlay system and integrating entities is tested and the corresponding results analysed. Some illustrative use cases of the system operation will be also presented and analysed.",

    "abstract": "The use of Business Intelligence (BI) platforms is an effective choice to support decision-making. BI platforms are a major asset for any enterprise, as they have multiple benefits that become a competitive advantage. It is known that BI implementation costs are one of the top factors for the non BI spread over Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Open source BI platforms provide most of the functionalities available in commercial solutions without increasing costs for organizations. Another factor also known to keep BI aside from SMEs: the complexity of implementation. This paper intends to answer the question that arises when the SME decides to move forward: can we implement a BI system? How complex will it be? It is conducted a case study where a prototype implementation of Pentaho BI platform takes place using a real case and data. The aim is to verify the complexity level of this implementation process and if it is within reach of an SME. The overall conclusion is that even though the process is not that complex, it should be managed by someone with knowledge in this area, either from the organization or from external.",

In each of these key places, a set of activities are presented in order to complement the information that can be inferred from the observation of some specific natural elements and/or to test the students' knowledge. With this work, we hope to contribute to the enrichment of the range of teaching/learning tools available to schools, especially those where resources are scarcer. The adopted developing methodology was the design science approach. The feedback received from the school during the Demonstration phase, where a first prototype was presented, was very positive, giving us the necessary motivation to improve the designed application and complete the last two phases of this approach in future work.",

One of the industries that most visibly had to adapt to the new reality was the production and dissemination of cultural contents, preparing for a consumer that is already native or casual digital. However, the new business model, especially, the one which implies access paid to cultural content, namely music, movies, TV series, images and news, does not still show a great success. In order to understand how the consumers of the generations X and Y (Millennials), from countries with unfavorable economic conditions, known as PIIGS, have adhered to the reality of online consumption of cultural content. The results from the Flash Eurobarometer 437: “Internet users' preferences for online accessing content” show the existence of three groups of consumers, and only one of them has a propensity to access paid content. Thus, by knowing the profiles of these three groups of consumers, it is possible to direct marketing campaigns tailored to each of them and to evaluate possible ways to convert consumers that only use of free services into consumers of paid services.",

Such resources become readily available to agents in each domain and to agents in all other domains with the aim of making them autonomous. The agents collaborate and interact with each other, through individual blockchain structures that also take care of operational security and integration aspects.

These activities can be a source of fun and entertainment, and at the same time improve their physical and psychological well-being. One of the options to meet the needs and expectations of the older people may be to use virtual reality (VR) games. For this purpose, it's important to identify design elements that make virtual reality games more suitable for the elderly audience. This study aims to check design recommendations extracted from previous research and also to identify new information that can contribute to the design of VR games focused on older people. In order to achieve this objective, we developed a virtual reality game for user testing with older participants. Participants' experience was recorded for qualitative analysis based on grounded theory. Besides a grounded theory, the results include a list of recommendations for games in virtual reality aimed at the elderly.",

So, they can prepare themselves to be digital citizens and at the same time meet the society demands. This need is known by the educational institutions of the city of Medellin (Colombia), which are advancing a project whose objective is to design and evaluate a strategy of didactic-curricular intervention for training in robotics and programming from pre-garden to eleventh grade of secondary education. The first objective in the initiative is to carry out an exploration of the successful teaching strategies in the aforementioned area. Next, the results of this task are presented, showing that the teaching-learning process of robotics and programming still has aspects to improve in terms of content, infrastructure, teaching, teacher training and support tools. Some approaches are complicated and not very fun for the target audience. There are some practices that are being carried out in other countries and even schools in Medellín and Colombia and it is worth repeating them to generate motivation in the students.",

This applies to two different kinds of information - short-term information related to daily operations in the shop floor as well as long-term accumulated knowledge and expertise. In the present article we propose several solutions for preventing short- and long-term information loss in an industrial setting. We analyze information loss and its consequences at an automotive component factory in the North of Portugal. For the short-term information loss, we propose lean tools such as gravity flow racks, kanban and andon screens. For long-term information loss, we propose the implementation of mentorship programs, the creation of a knowledge repository based on wiki technology and the use of explanatory labels.",

Organizations struggle to reach equilibrium between a dynamic operation of their organization and mitigate the risk of breach in what concerns people privacy rights. The problem that we aim to resolve in this paper is how to develop and manage efficiently privacy principles in an organization without putting at risk its dynamic operation. We aim to contribute to the equilibrium between strong controls and maintain flexible the way people operate on an organization. The drive of this paper is to introduce a compatibility risk matrix to establish a measure of a specific GDPR data protection principle - Purpose Limitation- in accordance with the best practices. This will allow an organization to add new services and verity if it maintains the compliance with GDPR with a minima efforts. In order to address this issue, we will use in our work in Activity theory and capture the scope of the organization.

Therefore, we can say that the distance a signal can travel without losing or corrupting information is limited. It is necessary to regenerate the signals periodically using regenerators. Given an optical network, the regenerator location problem tries to install a subset of regenerators with the minimum possible cost, in a way that each pair of nodes can communicate with each other. In this paper bio-inspired algorithms are used to solve this problem. Results obtained using 480 different instances prove their efficiency in solving the regenerator location problem.",

In this study, we analyzed the readability of web pages according to the topic to which it belongs and their position in the search result. For that, we collected the top-20 results retrieved by Google to 23,779 queries from 20 topics and used several readability metrics. The results of the analysis showed that the content from organizations (like colleges and other institutions) and health-related content have lower readability values. Categories Games and Home are on the opposite side. For the categories identified as having less readability, tools can be developed that help the user understand their content. We also found that top-ranked pages have higher values of readability. One can conclude that, directly or indirectly, readability is a factor that seems to be being considered by the Google search engine or has an influence on page popularity.",

Students could see their completion level of the course and be aware of their progress thanks to the completion tracking. There were also surprise elements and statements that appeared automatically when some tasks were completed. Points were accumulated, the leaderboard was shown and badges were awarded. In addition, students were encouraged to add value to the subject and give recognition to their colleagues through a collaborative social forum. All these elements of the virtual classroom were complemented by welcoming the students in each face-to-face session with a variety of soundtracks from different action films to provoke an attitude of improvement and achievement.",

Comparatively to the current method, this approach is more agile and diminishes the resources needed for an implementation. The approach discussed is focused on the use of convolutional neural networks, specifically the network YOLO. Using this method of identification, it was attained an accuracy of 92% of the waste containers.",

Effort is measured in terms of the total test time, which includes script creation and test execution in the case of automated testing, and comprises test execution and reporting in the case of manual testing. Effectiveness is measured in terms of the number and severity of defects found. The software under test is a set of Java web applications. The testing process was carried out by two testers within the organization. Our results show that automated testing needs a higher initial effort, mainly caused by the creation of the scripts, but this cost can be amortized in time as automated tests are executed multiple times for regression testing. Results also show that automated testing is more effective than manual testing at finding defects.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of the elderly or people with a particular type of dementia, such as Alzheimer's, is of great importance, especially when some functional capacities, such as reasoning, orientation, among others, are beginning to be compromised. The present work presents a system model that will allow the real time monitoring of elderly people or who suffer from some neurodegenerative pathology or mental deficiency, more likely to suffer occasional outbreaks of memory loss that may compromise their safety. Real-time monitoring includes vital signs monitoring equipment and the approximate location within and shape of the facilities, which will allow monitoring technicians at Private Social Solidarity Institutions (IPSS) to verify in real time the physical condition of their users. This system intends to make a significant leap in the use of ubiquitous and pervasive, nonintrusive computing, in the support of entities related to the Social Protection sector. In this way, the monitoring and followup of the users will be carried out by a specialized technician who can at any moment initiate a process of search and rescue of some users who may be in danger, that leaves the protection zone confined to IPSS, that loses vital signs, or is facing any other adverse event that could compromise their safety and, in the limit, their own life.",

It is a quantitative approach study that takes a stratified random sample of 122 web portals of municipal governments and the universe of 24 provincial governments. A rubric was designed to evaluate the 20 transparency indicators in accordance with current regulations and the technical criteria issued by the regulatory bodies of the Ecuadorian State. The transparency index of each of the portals evaluated was obtained. The average score, on a maximum scale of one hundred, is 39 for the portals of municipal governments and 64 for provincial governments. It seems that there is an influence between the region of the country to which the government belongs and the transparency index obtained, governments of the Sierra region have slightly higher scores. The degree of compliance with the indicators evaluated seems to be independent of the complexity of the information required in it, so that each government evaluated obtains very close scores in each group. The population size of the municipality is a predictor of the transparency index obtained A high degree of standardization has been achieved in the presentation format of public information in web portals.",

This resulted in four predominant factors: biological, behavioral, environmental and socioeconomic, in addition to the presence of culture influence and gender concepts. It was also inferred that there is a major impact of the individual's lifestyle on the possibility of falling, such as sedentary lifestyle, use of polypharmacy or alcoholism. With this, it is concluded that, because it is an accident with multiple influencing factors, it must be combated by multiple agentes. Nongovernmental organizations in partnership with municipalities and religious institutions should inform the elderly population of the fall, its causes and consequences. The Federal Government together with the Ministry of Health must carry out a plan of continuing education activities for health professionals about falls in the elderly and, finally, partnerships between large media and university centers to disseminate to the lay population the real impacts of the fall and its consequences. This must be done so that it can mitigate or even extinguish the relation of the risk factors associated with falls with the death of the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Funding is one of the main instruments used to support Research and Development (R&D) in Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Many countries introduce reforms in funding systems to promote excellence, knowledge transfer and socioeconomic innovation as a result of research. Resources for financing originate in the public or private sector. Most research projects in HEI are funded by public funds that are increasingly directed towards the development of innovation according to specific policy guidelines. Funded research involves distributing a considerable amount of money, which can lead HEI to desirable behavior by the funder and align their objectives with research priorities that ensure greater reward. In this paper, the aim is to analyze public funding, since it guarantees the subsistence of researchers and the means to conduct research in HEI, providing an overview of their evolution and current state in particular with regard to the nature and dynamics of funding schemes for research, and how these schemes contribute to their results. To achieve the objectives, a review exploratory of the literature on research funding was carried out in order to investigate its state of the art. The university's research environment has undergone profound changes as well as research funding systems. In current policies, incentives to competition and production are emphasized as a means to make HEIs efficient and productive.",

However, software process improvement (SPI) initiatives are complex because search to ameliorate the conditions and behavior of the professionals involved in software development. For this reason, indicators about change resistance in SPI initiatives show that underestimating the complexity of a change process and its consequent resistance to change weakens the results of such improvement. Therefore, there is a growing search of strategies for reduce the change resistance and as a result of this search, gamification is being used in this context because it helps to modify and influence the behavior of people and thus achieve the proposed goals. Motivated by the gamification benefits, in this article we propose a classification of the models of change resistance found in the literature looking to define a strategy that facilitate SPI initiatives implementation. Such classification proposal will be an input for the gamification use to decrease change resistance common causes in SPI initiatives. This classification is the result of a systematic literature review and the work with an experts group using transitivity law for relating models, causes and gamification principles.",

It has worked with a population of 61 people diagnosed with Alzheimer's, between 69 and 98 years old. The data obtained on the images were processed using the Viola-Jones method, making it possible to detect objects quickly and accurately. This method used the algorithm of neighbors with the canny border's technique. As a result, it was possible to create a database that includes the images of the patients' faces, in a gray scale, using high resolution.

    "abstract": "The elicitation of software security requirements in early stages of software development life cycle is an essential task. Using security requirements templates could help practitioners to identify implied software security requirements from functional requirements in the context of a software system. In this paper, we replicated a previous study that analyzed the effectiveness of security requirements templates to support the identification of security requirements. Our objective was to evaluate this approach and compare the applicability of the previous findings. We conducted the first replication of the controlled experiment in 2015, and subsequently conducted two differentiated replications in 2018. We evaluated the responses of 33 participants in terms of quality, coverage, relevance and efficiency and discussed insights regarding the impact of context factors. Participants were divided into treatment (security requirements templates) and control groups (no templates). Our findings support some previous results: treatment group performed significantly better than the control group in terms of the coverage of the identified security requirements. Besides, the requirements elicitation process performed significantly better in relevance and efficiency metrics in two of the three replications. Security requirements templates supported participants to identify a core set of the security requirements and participants were favorable towards the use of templates in identifying security requirements.",

Through this technology, benefits are obtained that provide the sensor networks together with greater freedom when placing the sensors in the vicinity of the target. In wireless sensor networks, routing is a critical and important aspect. The work focuses on the performance of the quality of services in the wireless sensor network (WSN) under the AODV routing protocol. This document tries to characterize the AODV protocol by performing simulations in the NS3 (Network Simulator Version 3) program. In the simulations of the AODV protocol, a set of metrics that can be used for comparisons in different scenarios are shown. The main objective of this document will be to offer a suitable simulation environment to determine the operation of the protocol to be used in wireless sensor networks.",

Analyzing this data correctly provides the company with very useful information that allows it to achieve competitive advantages to the company. However, the amount of data that is generated grows exponentially, imploying a challenge for the organization since the data they are received from different sources, so they have heterogeneous data, structured data and data without structure, which are generated at high speed and requires technologies that are useful for storing, processing and analyzing them Due to the size of these data, the volume of information and the need to obtain results in a short time, traditional technologies do not offer attractive options to companies, it is in this context that Big Data technologies, mining, data and data warehouse are the storage and data processing tools that offer relevant support in decision making in this 21st century.

    "abstract": "IT governance is a theme that has been in every day's business. Organizations are more interested in this area because they are concerned with value creation for their stakeholders and meeting their needs. IT governance is supported by a number of frameworks that help organizations reach their goals. The objective of this topic was based on a study to understand in detail the project of adoption of the Cobit 5 in an organization of the health sector in Portugal. The company chosen for the case study is SPMS (Shared Services of the Ministry of Health). This project aims to adopt Cobit 5 for issues of governance and management of Health Systems in order to promote continuous improvement in the health information ecosystem (eSIS) in which a set of initiatives are being implemented and risk management and information security are the most critical areas of this project and constitute the main area under analysis of this study.",

    "abstract": "Software organizations are continuously looking for techniques to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their testing processes. Model-based testing (MBT) is an approach that automates the design and generation of test cases based on a model that represents the system under test. MBT can reduce the cost of software testing and improve the systems quality. However, the introduction of the MBT approach could be complex for software development teams in the industry. This paper replicates a previous study that evaluated the use of MBT by software engineers in an industrial context. The goal of this replication is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of the MBT approach from the perspective of quality engineers testing a software application in the industry. We conducted a case study with four quality assurance engineers who modeled one module of the system under test, and then generated and executed a set of test cases using an MBT tool. Participants were able to use MBT to model and test the software system and provided several insights about the challenges and opportunities of using this approach.",

However, companies still have little knowledge about their customers and the most appropriate and effective processes to create a perfect fit between costumers' needs and companies' interests. To solve this problem, it is important to join e-commerce with Business Intelligence (BI). This paper provides a survey of the most popular business intelligence and e-commerce open source platforms and proposes an architecture to combine e-commerce with business intelligence. We study Pentaho and SpagoBI business intelligence platforms and Magento and OpenCart e-commerce platforms. An integration model of e-commerce and BI platforms is also proposed using an API and communication mechanisms.",

The sample is equal to the population of the institution, the inclusion criterion corresponds to the total of teachers who participated, that is, 63, and those who did not want to participate were excluded. The implications of two emerging factors are analyzed through the principal component analysis method. The results obtained from the instrument and its contrast with the data of use of Digital Technologies allow to determine that the attitudes of teachers towards them are ”Muy Favorables”, which is contradictory with the instrumental use they make of them. These findings are taken as a baseline to undertake a future training process that favors the mobilization of processes that focus Digital Technologies towards learning, empowerment and participation.",

    "abstract": "Searching for health information is the third most popular activity on the Internet. There is evidence that query suggestions in lay and medico-scientific terminology improve health information retrieval by who is not a health professional. Developing systems that suggest queries in these terminologies requires knowing if concepts are lay or medico-scientific. In this paper, we propose and compare approaches to compute the degree of association of a concept to lay and medico-scientific terminology. We use different thesauri for this purpose and use the cosine similarity to measure the closeness of concepts with subsets of those thesauri. The evaluation of our approaches uses an existing glossary containing concepts in both terminologies in English and Portuguese and a and a set of queries submitted by users and classified by health professionals as lay or medical-scientific. We concluded that the best method to classify a concept uses the CHV vocabulary as a subset.",

In this context, the primary research objective of this study is to analyze if robotics facilitates programming learning. To tackle the problem, we developed a robotic kit and a small course. The robotic kit used Arduino platform and was presented in the context of this course. The course consisted of programming concepts. This course was taught to higher education students, with no previous programming knowledge. In the end, we analyzed the impact of the course. Results demonstrate that students showed interest in using robotics to learn computer programming. Results also showed the main adoption determinants of the robotic kit. Enjoyment is the most relevant to the robotic kit intention to use. However, perceived ease is the dimension that has more impact on robotic kit usage.",

However, its complete and comprehensive nature can create difficulties, particularly when considering agile development environment, where lightweight development practices are preferred. In this work, we describe a methodology for optimizing agile processes based on CMMI, with reduced impact on pre-existing agility. This is achieved by defining improvement objectives with the GQM approach, that allow precise and intentional selection of CMMI practices with high impact towards the desired objectives. This methodology was validated in a medium size enterprise with good results.",

The presented strategy uses human-like gait with varying parameters such as step length and walking speed in order to adapt the robot's locomotion to different foot-floor friction coefficients. The gait parameters are chosen in order to minimize the probability of slipping, leading to an undesired fall. This choice of gait parameters is based on the analysis of the ground reaction forces and human behavior. Also, gait adaptation is further improved in order to follow a desired ZMP trajectory, through the use of a controller that offsets the hip and ankle joint angles. The novelty of this work lies on the fact that machine learning techniques are used to adapt the gait parameters and joint corrections to make the robot more resistant to both slipping and external disturbances.",

In addition to the research with students, studies were made in the field of education technology, investigating the impacts of this approach in learning. The game, called FlipENEM, was developed to run on an arcade machine in a way that is visually more attractive than the similar platforms already existent, which are also studied in this project. For the production of the software and assembly of the arcade machine, specific tools such as NetBeans, Java and MySQL Server were used. After the initial tests of the arcade with students in a campus, it was possible to observe its positive impacts, as reported by students in a research carried out later on.",

In principle, objective factors are expressed by numerical values being classified by limit values or ranges, while subjective factors express values that can hardly be represented numerically.

For this reason, the importance of considering defined processes to help select and prioritize those who are most relevant to the institution. The current work presents a proposal of solution to help manage the demands related to the process of inspection and classification of dam safety in a regulatory agency. The method, by application of Decision Making in Fuzzy Environment, had as objective to indicate which projects should be prioritized by the inspection team, based on criteria from common terms used in your daily routine. Its application allowed to measure and guarantee the consistency of the judgments along the process, minimizing risks, promoting more rationalization and administrative transparency.",

Firms benefit greatly from making this information available in order to respond more effectively to consumer dissatisfaction and to exploit market opportunities by observing standards that may represent unsatisfied needs. The present study aims to address this problem through a survey based on the Yelp platform. To this end, 14,000 comments related to different tourism products were used and text mining techniques and topic models were applied to find the main latent topics discussed in the online comments and their associated sentiments. The study presents 20 latent topics from online discussions and reveals that the topic that discusses “Air Travel” themes is the one with a lower sentiment connotation on average and should therefore be the subject of a deeper evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The academic environment is undoubtedly one of the main means of introduction to the field of computer programming, however, in this environment, where practice is crucial for the development of solid foundations, the number of given assignments falls short from ideal, especially because of the time it takes to evaluate the proposed solutions. To fill this gap, a web platform has been implemented to serve as a repository of programming problems, for practice and learning, but also with a section for competitive programming. Above all things, the platform is capable of evaluating user's submissions in real time. The solution for evaluating submissions involves the use of compilers associated with their programming language and a parallel execution to bring improvements in resource usage efficiency.",

In order to make these studies possible, the quality of the data that supports the analyzes must be guaranteed from the beginning of the data life cycle so that the results and models generated reflect the real scenario of the investigated phenomena. However, the collection of climate and biodiversity data presents significant challenges. This work performs a survey of the main quality problems identified in the bioclimatic data collection process. The methodological procedure consisted in identifying the problems, assigning the data quality dimension affected, and suggestions for possible solutions to the problems. The results of this survey showed that ambiguous methodological procedures during the data gathering and human interference are important factors for data quality impairment and the information obtained from these data. Thus, the correction of the data should focus on the collection processes and procedures, not the raw data itself.",

The purpose of this paper consists of exploring the extent to which the use of an omni-channel strategy by non-profits explaining the increase of loyalty of episodic volunteers, understood as the willingness to continue volunteering in other one-time events of a preferred non-profit organization. To do so, a quantitative-based research has been developed by conducting an online questionnaire survey from May 2017 to February 2018 to a representative sample of episodic volunteers of the Spanish Red Cross. 412 responses have been obtained from volunteers who have participated in one-time events organized by this non-profit. Ordered logistic regression analysis has been used to test the hypothesis proposed. Results suggest that the application of an omni-channel communication strategy may explain the increase on the loyalty of this type of volunteer.",

In many cases it is difficult for the teacher to identify if the children were able to understand the class. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to improve the learning process of the English language through a dynamic game. For this purpose, an interactive game was developed with a focus on gamification, where children have fun learning. The result of the game was satisfactory; in the game the children listen and see the fruits and colors on the screen. An initial test of teaching fruits and colors was done in a traditional way “Teacher - student”, in this first case of a total of 24 children, 17 understood their teacher. On the other case the test “Game - Student” demonstrated the success of the game with 21 children who understood what the game showed and improved their rating, and that is the proposed in this research.",

A bibliographic review was done using the empirical - analytical method to describe the impact of Telemedicine on users, a technology recently used in Colombia, which promises to become a tool that will support the solution of some health problems. Its development must be linked to the use of regulations that imply “Must be“ and its application must be decided in accordance with the legal principles, which compel the doctors and technicians to be accountable. The incessant development of medical technology, in its application in telemedicine, can lead to the vulnerability of ethical principles, and with it, the damage and misinterpretation of Medical Law. Also, to the possibility of rationalizing the criminal and civil responsibility of the medical practice in the service of telemedicine in Colombia. For this last, the authors of this text, we help with interviews and surveys with experts in telemedicine, especially in the city of Medellin, all in light of Colombian legislation. The truth is that the practice of telemedicine in Colombia has regulatory gaps that, if not remedied, sooner rather than later, will mark serious difficulties for the progress of this practic.",

For this, is essential the use of devices with computational power, such as smartphones. The tourism sector is a sector of great social and economic importance and is one of the sectors where there has been a growth in the use of mobile applications to support several activities. In this sector, mobile applications can be useful for tourists in general, but also for those who have some kind of disability or restriction. For these, mobile applications can help to obtain the information and recommendation of points of interest that are in accordance with their interests and are suitable to their restrictions. This paper describes the development of a mobile application for presentation and personalized recommendation of points of interest for inclusive tourism. The goal is an application to run on smartphone with Android OS able to provide the user with information compatible with their own profile. This application stands out by allowing an automatic filtering of information, considering the location and profile of the user, and providing him with more personalized information, relevant and appropriate to his situation, and thus contributing to a better inclusion. This paper describes the most relevant aspects of the development of the application.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the impact of technology and on the planning of a trip by a Portuguese tourist. From the literature review, studies done at the European level, the technology inherent to tourism is provided to the entire age range, and fundamentally to the planning of accommodation, transport and tourist packs. The absorption of information is always highlighted by the easy and fast access to the Internet increasingly accessible to anyone, promoting behavioral changes in tourism planning. Thus, an online survey (with 180 valid answers) was carried out, which focused mainly on university students, and was restricted to Portuguese citizens. The survey determined that online platforms are most used for accommodation (87.2%), transportation (87,2%) and the demand for information (68.8%) to the detriment of catering (7.3%), and these are mainly being used because of their speed (79.4%) and simplicity (80.7%). To conclude, our study confirms the bibliographic review, and it was determined that practically all respondents assume the influence of digital platforms in the planning of their trips (99.1%), with 89% going further and affirming that in the future all planning will be carried out in an exclusive way online.",

    "abstract": "The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network composed of several devices (things) connected to the Internet and to each other. IoT services are increasingly growing and are allowing companies to deploy scalable solutions with reduced costs and instantaneous data access. These solutions require seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such requirements can be given to a company's IoT solution by applying blockchain technology. This paper analyzes the blockchain technology and the advantages and challenges behind its implementation in an IoT environment. A blockchain in IoT scenario was developed to evaluate the performance of different cryptographic hash functions in the IoT device RaspberryPi. Conclusions were drawn when it comes to the viability of some hash functions mainly based on the low resource characteristic shared by the IoT devices, which compromises the performance of the hash function.",

The Higher Education Institutions (IES) show a deterioration of the reading competence of their students and as an answer they are implementing changes within the curricula of the career programs, in order to implement strategies that improve these competence. This research describes the use of innovative strategies using ICTs that improved reading skills at the inferential, literal and critical levels of students of the nursing career of the Regional Autonomous University of the Andes (UNIANDES), using a Learning Management System (Moodle), activities, resources and extensions of it, in addition face-to-face and virtual sessions that wake up a motivation for reading and improved the critical thinking of the participants.",

Despite growing research on the most diverse areas of the collaborative economy, research on the integration of blockchain systems into collaborative economy organizations is still rather limited. By the present investigation, purely explanatory and based on a comparative and interpretive case study, we intend to verify the susceptibility of the blockchain systems to foster the emergence of new business models. Due to the small number of organizations in the collaborative economy currently operating with blockchain-based business models, it will be important in future investigations to identify and study the influence of these systems on the business models of other organizations, in particular whether their adoption represents a source of competitive advantage.",

Customers are currently expecting applications with good performance in less time and at lower cost. The demand for a hybrid solution which allows the development of applications for both platforms with the same code is no longer new. React Native is a recent framework that has emerged to bridge the gaps presented by previous solutions, combining JavaScript development, which is now considered the best solution for frontend development. In this article, a comparative analysis of the development time of the main functionalities of an audio-guide application for Java (Android), Swift (iOS) and React Native (Android and iOS) is made. This work shows that Swift is the solution with the lowest development time, while React Native and Java have very similar overall development times, however with the particularity that React Native supports both the two main mobile operating systems.",

The scientific problem that raises is how to define a procedure for botnet detection with limited resources. In this paper, a botnets' detection method, based on machine learning, is formalized and evaluated. This proposal makes use of Splunk, a tool that allowed us to use the Random Forest algorithm to analyze DNS logs in order to detect connections to C&C servers. The resulting procedure complements the use of machine learning with the verification against other data sources for improving the results. The achieved results showed an error margin of +/- 5.44 for 18,748,713 events which were analyzed. This way, the validity of this proposal was proved.",

Thus, the present article aims to present the web application From Garbage to Luxury as a Social Technology tool developed for the extension project Garbage to Luxury of the Federal University of Southern Bahia (UFSB). In general, it works as a Social Bank because it enables the application of the concept of social currency, where users “buy” clothing using recyclable materials as currency. It can be concluded from the actions carried out that the web application From garbage to Luxury served in a satisfactory way to the objectives for which it was conceived: to act as a social technology.",

Higher Education Institutions (IES) view the cloud as an opportunity to modernize their services, but the diversity of architecture and number of cloud service providers has made it difficult for IES to choose the best platform to adopt. On the other hand, the permanent access to broadband Internet, the adequacy of internal IES management processes to cloud business models and security issues, are the main challenges for the integration of cloud computing in education.

    "abstract": "Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) perform every day more critical operations. Originally, sensor nodes were connected in closed networks, where they only collected data and sent them to a central server to be processed. However, with the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution and the era of Cyber-Physical Systems, Wireless Sensors Networks are employed in a large catalogue of applications, many of them critical: traceability, ambient intelligence, biological signal control, etc. At the beginning, simple encryption techniques were enough, but as more sophisticated applications are proposed, protection schemes turn also more complex. In particular, schemes based on digital signatures, hash functions and Public Key Infrastructures are extensively implemented. Nevertheless, all these solutions present a very important problem: nodes must store a secret key. As future systems will be unmanaged and be deployed in remote places without surveillance, the use of ROM memories where keys are stored in a permanent way is a critical risk. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new scheme for signature delegation in WSN, based on magnetic Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). PUF take advantage of any physical properties to build private keys which are inaccessible and impossible to replicable; what added to the intrinsic complexity magnetic phenomena will enable us to define an inviolable signature scheme. A simulation scenario is also defined to validate the usability and performance of the proposed framework.",

The internet affirms itself as a differentiating factor and determinant of attitudes and behaviors. Considering the ease of access and the familiarity of Millennials, with the new technologies, it lacks analysis the preferences of use and consumption of music and films and television series, anchored in the Internet. The present study seeks to understand if there are differences between the Portuguese and Spanish users' behavior or perceptions about the consumption of Internet contents in terms of music (or music videos) and films and television series and if such differences are reflected in the age groups. Using the Flash Eurobarometer 437 database, it is identified that age groups is significantly related to the frequency of using the Internet to access music and films online. It is also observed that gender is significantly related to frequency of using the Internet to access films online. The choices facing the Portuguese and Spanish age groups are homogeneous regarding the frequency of Internet use to access music but not films online. These results can be an indication that policies concerning the music and films contents should fit the characteristics of each of these age groups in both countries.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the process of usability of a game that simulates the resolution of questions of the ENEM (Exame National do Ensino Médio). So, with this possible, in an attractive way to students, another possibility of exercising their knowledge throughout their preparation for the exam. In order to achieve this objective, a qualitative research was developed, which demonstrates, in its results, the interest of students in using a platform like the one created in this project. In addition to the research with students, studies were made in the field of education technology, investigating the impacts of this approach in learning. The game was developed to run on an arcade machine in a way that is visually more attractive. For the production of the software and the arcade machine, specific tools such as NetBeans, Java and MySQL Server were used. After the initial tests of the arcade with students in a campus, it was possible to observe its positive impacts about the attractivity.",

    "abstract": "At the time of more and more devices being connected to the internet, personal and sensitive information is going around the network more than ever. Thus, security and privacy regarding IoT communications, devices, and data are a concern due to the diversity of the devices and protocols used. Since traditional security mechanisms cannot always be adequate due to the heterogeneity and resource limitations of IoT devices, we conclude that there are still several improvements to be made to the 2nd line of defense mechanisms like Intrusion Detection Systems. Using a collection of IP flows, we can monitor the network and identify properties of the data that goes in and out. Since network flows collection have a smaller footprint than packet capturing, it makes it a better choice towards the Internet of Things networks. This paper aims to study IP flow properties of certain network attacks, with the goal of identifying an attack signature only by observing those properties.",

    "abstract": "The continuous evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) causes the need for people to acquire ever higher levels of digital literacy in order to maintain their sense of inclusion, especially the older adult population. It can be argued that digital literacy is a set of skills associated with the use of ICT that each individual must develop in order to function in a computerized society. The purpose of this research is to describe the experiences, needs and learning styles of older adults (over 60) who participated in Digital Literacy Workshops - both face-to-face and mixed. This study had the participation of 98 adults aged 60 or over, including 72 women (68.5 ± 6.9) and 26 men (73.3 ± 7.4). The results reveal that the learning needs of the participants are related to the constant practice, usefulness and perceived ease of use of new technologies. On the other hand, the learning style most adopted by older adults is multimodal (69%), which means that they process information in more than one way. In addition to the fact that their learning processes are related to their life experiences, it is necessary to apply different teaching methods in the instruction of older adults.",

With the advancement of technology, it has become possible to offer online access to information and services in a democratic and transparent way and greater interaction of the population with its rulers, called EGovernment. One of the key features of a government website should be accessibility. The purpose of this article is to present a panorama of the accessibility of the official government websites of different countries, using automatic tests according to the guidelines of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. It was concluded that none of the countries has minimally accessibility requirements. For a small number of countries it was possible to observe the relationship between economic and social indicators and accessibility in government portals, but it was not possible to generalize the results.",

    "abstract": "The growth in Internet usage has increased the use of electronic services requiring users to register their identity on each service they subscribe to. This has resulted in the prevalence of redundant users data on different services. To protect and regulate access by users to these services identity management systems (IdMs)are put in place. IdMs uses frameworks and standards e.g SAML, OAuth and Shibboleth to manage digital identities of users for identification and authentication process for a service provider. However, current IdMs have not been able to address privacy issues (unauthorised and fine-grained access)that relate to protecting users identity and private data on web services. Many implementations of these frameworks are only concerned with the identification and authentication process of users but not authorisation. They mostly give full control of users digital identities and data to identity and service providers with less or no users participation. This results in a less privacy enhanced solutions that manage users available data in the electronic space. This article proposes a user-centred mandate representation system that empowers resource owners to take full of their digital data; determine and delegate access rights using their mobile phone. Thereby giving users autonomous powers on their resources to grant access to authenticated entities at their will. Our solution is based on the OpenID Connect framework for authorisation service. To evaluate the proposal, we've compared it with some related works and the privacy requirements yardstick outlined in GDPR regulation [1] and [2]. Compared to other systems that use OAuth 2.0 or SAML our solution uses an additional layer of security, where data owner assumes full control over the disclosure of their identity data through an assertion issued from their mobile phones to authorisation server (AS), which in turn issues an access token. This would enable data owners to assert the authenticity of a request, while service providers and requestors also benefit from the correctness and freshness of identity data disclosed to them.",

For tourism, the government has developed a series of information systems that allow territorial entities to make decisions and inform themselves about the activity, however these may not consider variables related to sustainable development. In this paper we propose an Information System for Nature Tourism in Colombia, where through the use of CRISP-DM, we obtain a functional prototype that allows the visualization of different variables relevant to ecotourism, in order to identify opportunities and gaps in the departments of Colombia. The prototype is socialized with experts and evidence that the system is useful to analyze the business and a series of recommendations are left for the scalability of the exercise.",

The methodology used was based on the use of Nearpod platform through mobile devices, tablets or laptops, to improve interactivity in the face-to-face classes provided to students. The results obtained show that the students have had a favorable opinion and are satisfied with the use of this platform, because it allows to increase the interaction and participation in the activities in class. However, managing large groups presents difficulties due to the limited number of simultaneous licenses and the student's unstable connection to the institutional Wi-Fi internet network. Nearpod as a collaborative and interactive learning platform is a system that allows students to improve their concentration and participation, which is an opportunity to complement the learning provided by the teacher.",

    "abstract": "Classifying web queries into a set of categories is a crucial task to better understand the user's intent behind a query, contextualize their search and provide more relevant results to the user. However, web queries are typically short and ambiguous making the query classification a non-trivial problem. In this article, we present a new automatic approach for identifying and characterizing queries in the health domain. This method makes use of the search engine counts through a semantic similarity measure called Normalized Google Distance (NGD)combined with Support Vector Machines to classify queries into three dimensions: health-related, severity and semantic type. To evaluate our methods, we used two datasets in different languages, Portuguese and English, and built another for evaluating the last dimension. Overall, the results achieved were satisfactory. The most generic classification obtains better results than more specific ones. The NGD proved to be a valuable assent in query classification.",

The objective of this work is to identify what game elements have been used to build serious games and gamification approaches for CPR training, and how this may influence the user's learning. From 3 repositories 307 articles were returned from the query, only 33 of these obeyed the inclusion criteria set for the study. The studies should be directed at the general population or health professionals; describes a system/method related to CPR or BLS training and using a gamified approach. Results show that, most of the games are digital; single player and don't use any external hardware. Regarding game elements, simple scoring is the most common feature. The main purpose of training CPR systems focuses more on knowledge acquisition and less on actual practice of CPR skill.",

However, to date, there are no studies on the state of practice for this area focusing on issues similar to those investigated in the SLRs mentioned above. The objective of this article was to report on the state of the practice of adopting strategies to increase customer value in the ASD and to detail these strategies concerning goals pursued, customer value metrics, challenges and usage impacts, and the reasons for non-adoption. A survey was performed using a web questionnaire answered by software professionals who are members of agile teams. Data were collected from 378 respondents from 123 Brazilian software intensive organizations. Prioritizing the development of high-value customer features and validating them frequently (92.3%), as well as focusing on value aspects of the client's market segment and applying the most relevant agile practices to make them viable (64.8%), appeared to be the strategies most frequently practiced by agile teams. Generally, the experiences of using these strategies appear to be very positive, although challenges have also been identified, such as defining what is customer value and customer collaboration.",

This work aims to develop an intervention model related with Student Profile at the end of the compulsory education. In this way we started the PRO(g)NATURA, where the adopted methodology is focused on student's motivation and interests, articulating education, nature and Scratch programming software, developed in the curricular flexibility scope for the 1st year of Basic Education. The adopted methodology is a symbiosis of several methods and techniques described in the literature which intends to relate and motivate students in individual ways supressing their school adaptation problems, community insertion problems and concepts acquisition. With this program we intend to evaluate knowledge development impact (mathematics and mother language), attitudes and values (related to knowledge and civic formation) and abilities (cognitive, emotional and practical), as well as in the school community (students, professors and families). There is a strong social inclusion component associated to this model since the majority of students came from socially vulnerable contexts.",

In order to do so, a software supported by computational vision and machine learning techniques was developed, aiming to collect images and analyze them to identify striae. From a database of images annotated by specialists in dermatology, color and texture attributes of the segments were extracted, which were later classified by the Random Forest algorithm, which presented a 99.92% correct classification of the striae. In addition, metrics were analyzed that indicated that although the streak superpixels were correctly classified, other classes were classified incorrectly.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the findings obtained regarding the way in which systems engineering students interpret the field of knowledge in software engineering are presented. Based on a questionnaire on the interrelation of concepts, conceptual relationships are identified located in hierarchical clusters that allow ontologies to be established to interpret the way in which knowledge evolves in the training program. As a result, ten conceptual clusters are obtained which contrasted with the knowledge areas proposed by the theoretical referents, allow the identification of failures in the conceptual relationships in the Systems Engineering knowledge field for students from the first to the eighth semester in order to adjust MOOC-type courses to this needs.",

The research focused on the potential of using the QR code in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education. As such, the objectives of this research were based on the promotion of the use of the QR Code in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education, in the implementation of the use of the QR Code in the scope of the curricular area of Portuguese, in the evaluation of the contribution of the QR Code in the teaching and learning process and in the analysis of the opinions of the students and the Cooperating Adviser regarding the contribution and impact of the QR Code in the curricular area of Portuguese. This study followed as a principle a methodology of qualitative nature in the research-action modality. Data collection instruments included: participant observation, field notes, photographic records, questionnaire survey and semi-structured interview. After the data collection, treatment and analysis, it was verified that the use of the digital application “QR Code” as a pedagogical resource was a decisive element for the improvement of students' vocabulary development, of textual production, more concretely in the writing of the synopses, in reading comprehension, in cooperation with others and in the students' sense of interest in the teaching and learning process. In addition, the project developed with the School Library was an added value, because it allowed the students to produce materials that demonstrated what they are capable, valuing their learning. In this way, a sense of pride and confidence grew in them, when they were authors of their own QR Codes.",

    "abstract": "Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) have revolutionized the relation between higher education institutions and society. Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform. This study focuses on the academic results obtained, and the different profiles of students that have been identified in the 2018 academic year.",

This problem is known in the literature as the Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem (HHCRSP), which is considered an NP-Hard problem. In this paper we propose a solution with mathematical programming in two stages (based on the problem of traditional assignment and the problem of the traveling agent (TSP)) for a case study, whose restrictions are not found in the literature; that constrains add complexity to the problem, but could be common in the real world. This approach has the potential to become replicable for other similar situations.",

    "abstract": "This article demonstrates that whatever the descriptions of computational algorithms, what they present are some types of heuristics in the computational logic for the optimization of the acquisitions and treatments of information. The information acquired is always stored in digital media, organized in a group with indexing access in any order, which allows them to be related to indexer types of another group in digital media. The methodology is based on the generation of a unique indexing in such a way that the information is ordered hierarchically. Once a single indexing is made into a digital media, the algorithm can describe the order in which the information should be displayed or worked. The result is the availability of the information in a more optimized time in relation to a conventional logic, and always meeting the project objective. The choice of one of the types of heuristics, the indexing ordering and the crossing between digital media leads to the obtaining of a greater or lesser time in the access to the information and in its treatment, where normally the lack of this indexation is cause of delay in access or even of the absence of some data.",

This implies properly identifying the knowledge, skills and aptitudes that a professional need to practise, and with it, the curricular activities that will allow him to achieve it. The definition of based-competency curriculums it is a new paradigm that requires changes in the way of teaching. In this work the authors propose an ontology that conceptualizes the idea of competencies in the formulation of the curriculum of subjects, focused on university engineering careers. This ontology is part of an ontology network developed previously by the authors. The idea is to take a step forward in the definition of e-learning semantic tools that give support to teacher in the formulation of the competencies and the selection of teaching material and assessment tools, establishing relationships between all of them to achieve the objectives. In this way, this work provides a conceptual framework that facilitates the definition of competency-based curriculums and allows relating it with the teaching and assessment methodologies to achieve the defined competencies.",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions have a significant impact on health and all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterized by various sources of pollution that can lead to unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, laboratory activities, especially in the case of experiments using thermography, require the supervision of several parameters. The proliferation of the Internet of Things paradigm (IoT) shows great potential for the creation of automatic solutions for monitoring indoor environments. In general, people spend about 90% of their time inside buildings so it is significant to use realtime monitoring systems in order to identify bad ambient conditions. The timely detection of poor ambient conditions allows you to plan interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. This paper aims to present a laboratory environment conditions supervision solution based on IoT architecture called iLabM+. The solution is composed of prototype hardware for the collection of the data environment and a Web portal for data consulting and analysis. This system allows monitoring of temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and air quality. The results obtained are promising and represent a significant contribution to IoT-based environmental quality monitoring systems.",

    "abstract": "On one hand, humans typically spent about 90% of their time in indoor environments, therefore, indoor air quality is of the utmost importance as buildings have several sources of pollutants. On the other hand, the ageing of the global population presents a great opportunity for the development of solutions for ambient assisted living. The majority of existing air quality monitoring systems on the market are expensive, do not have direct forms of communication with the user, do not use social networks to share collected data and do not offer support for automated robots. This article presents iAirBot a standalone robot capable of monitoring indoor air quality. A gas sensor and a “Sun Spot” sensor network are used for monitoring air quality. Other sensors can be added to monitor specific pollutants. The results reveal not only that this automated mobile air monitoring solution is feasible as well as that indoor air quality may in some cases be very different from what would be expected. The proposed system can provide an effective form of interaction with the user. The authors believe that in the near future the company's robots will have APIs for data sharing in social networks as well as offer interconnection with indoor monitoring systems.",

This solution intends to integrate a monitoring system, based on a network of pressure, temperature and humidity sensors, together with a non-invasive actuation system that operates autonomously and locally, promoting immediate relief of pressure in critical areas. In addition, it is also intended to develop a mobile application, which continuously communicate with the mattress guard, allowing caregivers to be able to, at any time, consult the patient's condition. This article presents the work carried out under the digital technology component, namely the graphic design and programming work required to reach the solution presented. This solution will provide the means of interaction between the user and the mattress guard, in order to access the data generated by the device. In this case, the main focus was the design of a graphic interface, simple and adaptable to different target audience, facilitating their reading and interaction.",

The current publishing landscape is evolving, as shown by the emergence of notebook technologies powering a new generation of interactive Web Journals. These use state-of-the-art interactive graphical visualizations and on-demand data processing to research papers, allowing readers to trace every step of the process, from raw data to the finalized visualization. Since there are many Research Notebook technologies and interactive graphical visualization solutions to choose from, we present a summary comparative overview of Web Journals and the Notebook engines that power the interactive, data driven visualizations inside their publications. Given our focus on visualization, our metrics are the support for the most advanced, popular and widely adopted data visualization frameworks. We conclude that Jupyter Notebook is currently the best alternative for the average user, given its popularity and support, combined with broad support for powerful and high-level interactive visualization grammars.",

Technology, information, and knowledge has an important impact in peripheral regions when they want to participate in the global market. Exists a lot of discussion about the digital divide between countries but little in relation to the regions and especially Less Favoured Regions (LFR). There is a clear evidence that these internal disparities can lead to the continued marginalization of people and regions “disconnected” from global information networks, which support the modern economy and causing strong inequalities. By other side, data available about the ICT use are normally from central regions and not Less Favoured Regions. With this study, we made a study to understand the ICT use by small enterprises and entrepreneurs from peripheral regions from Portugal and Spain: 5 Spanish regions (Leon, Zamora, Salamanca, Valladolid, Ávila) and 2 Portuguese (Alto Tâmega e Terras de Trâs-os-Montes). For that, 433 surveys were carried out (170 in the Portuguese regions and 263 in Spanish areas), included in project COMPETIC.",

The results indicate that the Brazilian private educational segment occupies 87.91% of the market share, with the 10 largest educational groups dominating 31.6% of the market. In contrast, the government system reduced its investment by 66.6% in the same period (2013-2017), which facilitated the private educational domain. Although there is an increase in distance courses (48.51%), the number of graduates is still relatively low (26.5%) in this category.",

However, the learning strategies need to be based on the diversity of styles present in the classroom, having the teacher first understood the student's need through the interpretation of their emotions, expressed from body signals such as heart beats, temperature, brain waves, facial and body expressions. Thus, the objective of this work is to study and propose a model to represent these body signals and relate them to the learning process, using computational resources based on technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data and the internet of things by means of 4 steps: selection of technologies; signal capture; identification and analysis of captured data; and analysis based on theories and learning styles.

Furthermore, those elements can collect data from the environment in order to be processed and give better products and services, so, Internet of Things capabilities arises to home, highly cohesive with domotics. However, for developing countries, smart appliances are expensive, and old fridges, washing machines, etc., are still operative, so they must not to be discarded. Other very used appliances are stoves, which work with heating methods like electrical resistances, electrical induction or natural gas. The last one is the most used in a plenty of countries, due to its advantages regarding cost, for instance. Nonetheless, bad manipulation can cause gas leakages, and furthermore, injuries to people and conflagrations, affecting human lives and assets. Thus, a need has been identified regarding gas safety of gas stoves, conserving the installed base. This work shows the results of the main research and design considerations of a new cutting-edge technology that protects people of bad manipulation of already installed or new gas stoves, including the Internet of Things in order to monitor in real-time possible gas leakages and take actions.",

As in OFDM timing synchronization is needed in FBMC as it is also a multi-carriers waveform. Several algorithms are present in literature for burst detection in FBMC. Since SDR faces resources scarcity problem, the selection of appropriate algorithm which can provide desired detection performance with acceptable computational complexity is a major challenge. In this paper three algorithms including Minn's algorithm, Park's algorithm, and Leila's algorithm have been investigated based on their detection performance and computational complexity.

Each SG application has its own requirements of latency, throughput and reliability. Cognitive Radio (CR), which offers better spectrum utilization through opportunistic spectrum access and spectrum sharing, is considered as a promising wireless technology for SG networks. Traffic scheduling and optimization is one of major challenges in CR-based SG communication network. In this paper, we propose a novel usage of mini-batch gradient descent method for the optimization of QoS-based differential scheduling in CR-based SG network. A 2-class based priority scheduling model with emergency and interrupt handling capability is used. It is shown through simulation results that mini-batch gradient descent method achieves better results as compared to gradient descent method in terms of the fast convergence and minimization of the overall cost function.",

IoT devices are smart devices designed with simple functions in mind, like collecting the temperature or opening a door. However, IoT devices lack a good security layer due to lack of resources: small memory, processor and/or battery. Consequently, new potential attacks and security problems have arisen. In order to detect and mitigate these security problems Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)can be used, However, abnormal traffic must be distinguished from normal IoT patterns. In this article, a study was done on characterization of traffic signatures of two typical IoT application protocols - MQTT and MQTTS - with the objective of generating and collecting IP flows of said traffic. An IoT application scenario was simulated and using the traffic collected, an analysis of MQTT and MQTTS flows were elaborated to identify flow-based signatures that could be used to identify the network traffic of IoT application protocols.",

Considering the impact that IoT networks have on the market, their protection is essential and, is now one of the themes in constant evolution. With the focus on security, this work aims to characterize a CoAP and CoAPS signatures, through the analysis of a flow in a test scenario and recognize the types of messages of the signature and what is their impact on the network and later creating rules that could help an IDS, in order to save resources and time. When analyzing the flows, it was concluded that it is possible to identify some characteristics of a signature, such as identifying Confirmable and Non-Confirmable messages.",

    "abstract": "The current study has as its objective to analyse how the study of languages is affected by new technologies. The way of teaching as well as the learning process are not the same as in older times, so we think that it is important to analyse the phenomenon. There are several advantages to the use of technology, and the future heralds even greater evolution. The effect of technologies on teaching has been very significant and even university professors resort to the usage of websites or other technological tools. The concept of innovation is not only associated to information and communication technologies, but also to the process and innovative supply of methods of access to knowledge. Therefore, associating innovation to the teaching of languages is something completely acceptable, since the usage of technological resources is a form of innovating. Because the final objective is to find a coherent response that indicates what is currently happening in the world of education concerning languages, primary data was obtained via a total of eleven interviews answered by young language students and professors. With this study, we conclude that technologies will continue to have an impact on the future of teaching. There is a general consensus concerning the relevance of obtaining better academic results. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that learning becomes more facilitated with technology because there is easier access to information.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the number and quality of technologies has imposed on education in general new forms of learning, some with less relevance, but others with recognized results in the educational and scientific community. The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)are an example of one of these technologies with recognized results because that seems to contribute to the acquisition and mastery of digital competences in the context of the realization of the teaching-learning process supported by the networks. It is in these networks that all the participants in the educational process interact and collaborate with all, cultivate connections, debate the themes, present their criticisms, update their knowledge, acquire new skills, make decisions, but generically develop as members of a connectivist community. Based on these assumptions, in this research we intend to make a review of the literature to identify the aspects that, in detriment of regular education, to encourage the teachers to adopt the MOOC as technology for their professional development and to carry out the process of teaching and learning. Thus, through an exploratory research, characterized as documentary, we use the main sources of information, in this case scientific articles published on the subject to understand the relevance and contribution of the MOOC in an educational universe supported by technologies. In general, the results, although preliminary because of temporal limitations issues in accompanying the rapid evolution of the scientific production of knowledge, suggest that on the one hand the teachers opt for MOOC education for the ease of distance learning; on the other hand, adopt the MOOCs for the acquisition of digital skills oriented to the new challenges.",

Currently, one of the most commonly used problem-solving mechanisms are genetic algorithms, due to the wide range of problems that can be covered, considering the degree of study, and the number of times that have already been addressed. From there, genetic algorithms are presented as the most accurate method to face and solve these problems.

This paper presents a method to efficiently produce models of natural vegetation. The produced models are then applied to populate existing terrain definitions, allowing the fast preparation of extensive environments with realistic landscapes. The human supervisor can interact in this generation process, in order to obtain custom landscapes definitions. After the landscape generation process, the road network definition can be then generated, producing a complete driving environment, in an integrated modeling process.

In this context, this study aims to analyze the scientific production about the thematic trust in the sharing economy through bibliometric techniques. For this purpose, a search of the Scopus platform was carried out, which initially resulted in 145 publications, in later phases these studies were selected and analyzed with the aid of software. The bibliometric analysis allowed us to explore the literature about trust in the sharing economy between the years 2013 to 2018. The findings were categorized into annual publication of articles, origin and quantity of publications, methodological nature, instruments and techniques of data collection, association between authors by affiliation countries, occurrence of keywords and referenced authors to conceptualize the sharing economy. By considering the sharing economy a recent and changing subject, this mapping elucidates the advancement of publications and identifies the current research scenario. For future studies, it is suggested to analyze the various platforms based on topics such as familiarity, perceived risk, security, privacy and interaction and design in the digital platforms of the sharing economy.",

Initially the professional will define the settings of the game by selecting the facial expression to be worked with the child. After the selection will be displayed a screen containing sample of the chosen image, initiating the interactivity with the game, in which will be presented a screen with “n” positions with “m” in order to improve the learning of the desired facial expression. After the child has traversed all the “n” positions of the screen, one more interaction will be added with the objective of strengthening the learning. At each stage a new position will be developed on the screen, representing different levels in the game. This process repeats itself during all phases of the game. At the end is presented a screen containing the score, as positive reinforcement for the stimulation of the child, stimulating his cognitive emotional. Educators have access to reports with the results corresponding to each phase of the game, containing the amount of interactions, the amount of ringtones in other buttons, the amount of ringtones off the buttons, the total of ringtones and the time spent to complete each Phase.",

Nevertheless, constraints on artificial vision and interactive interfaces remain a challenge, namely the ones related to Computer Vision (CV)techniques, since HD cameras drones need to transmit video streams in real-time to Ground Stations (GS). Additionally, GS interfaces of this type of applications are usually not easy to use for unexperienced pilots. In this work, we propose an architecture for SAR operations, integrating an interactive interface that can be used with commercial UAV and Head-Mounted Display (HMD)devices, which provide Mixed Reality (MR)for GS. Results on an application prototype show that a fine tunning process of a non-traditional object detection model with SAR images can improve human detection precision with real-time video streaming.",

With the objective of assisting in the culture of academic productions that can be turned into patents, the present work seeks to stimulate these requests through the creation of multiple Key Performance Indicators, specific to each cycle of higher education, that can be used by any institution in Portugal. For the elaboration of these indicators, it was used mathematical correlations in the official data of the Portuguese government, in the period from 2007 to 2018, in relation to the number of students and those of patent applications. Therefore, after adequate treatment of the data, it was possible to estimate such key performance indicators, oriented by level of training and according to the objectives of each institution.",

The future of AI is promising and is offering a wide range of opportunities for scholars and academics. Although the theme has received a considerable attention over the last years, much has been speculated and little is known about its impacts on the Public Administration. Thus, the purpose of this article is to make the result of those impacts less ambiguous. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review to provide a comprehensive analysis on the latest impacts of AI on the Public Administration. Our intent is to narrow the field of study, while AI is being continuously strengthened with new empirical evidences.",

    "abstract": "The development of software products and services within organizations generates a large amount of information that is not recorded and is generally known as tacit knowledge, that is the most valuable information for an organization, since knowledge helps to improve and avoid repetitions of errors. In this context, the implementation of Software Process Improvement within this type of organizations is increasingly important, due to the constant demand for quality in their products and services. However, many of these organizations lose this knowledge and it is not reflected in their software development processes. Therefore, this article establishes the current state of the techniques, tools and strategies for good knowledge management that allow the extraction of tacit knowledge, and its importance within the software processes improvement. The analysis carried out had made it possible to identify the importance of knowledge management and the case studies where knowledge management has been implemented in the software processes improvement. The analysis of the 16 primary studies has identified the importance of knowledge management showing that 15% of the selected primary studies propose a technique, another 15% a tool, while 23% propose a strategy equal to 20% a new domain, with this 27% present a case study.",

    "abstract": "Public television faces a context of questioning and criticism exacerbated by the recent economic crisis, which has led to the closure of public regional channels in Spain and all over Europe. Added to this, in contextual terms, the change in the profile of audiences, now, online therefore, each time more participatory. Thus, the digitalization of processes, the fragmentation of audiences, the multiplication of the offer of free access through DTT, the emergence of various payment platforms and the consolidation of the Internet and the new media as consumer devices, lead to a new stage in the dynamics and the reach of public television, a set of factors that leads to the focus on the online communication strategies of European public televisions. So far, the studies in this area have been consolidated around three axes of analysis, one of them much more recent: 1)Programming strategies 2)Hearings and their evolution and 3)Corporate Social Responsibility, governance, accounts submission and transparency. This third line frames the proposal of this communication that focuses on the analysis of the Internet from the point of view of Corporate Communication and, more specifically, from the relational paradigm. The research, exploratory, uses an intentional sample or convenience (hence non-probabilistic)formed by Radiotelevisión Española, RTVE (Spain), France Televisions, FT (France), Radiotelevisione Italiana, RAI (Italy), British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC (Great Britain), Rádio and Televisão de Portugal, RTP (Portugal)and Arbeitsgemeinschaft der ö ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, ARD and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, ZDF (Germany). The specific items of the analysis are: global position in the ranking of websites; visit traffic: number of pages visited, average time and (Bounce Rank). Organized and promoted traffic and analysis of the activity of each channel in the main general social networks to determine, mainly, their frequency, thematic and interactivity.",

Loneliness is correlated with a greater risk of depression and the prevalence of several diseases, which have a very significant cost for the economy. The aim of this project is to develop a platform to support the management of activities for combating loneliness targeted for people over 60 years old. A study was carried out to find and analyze the approaches used to combat loneliness and to promote active aging. At the same time, several interviews were conducted with social workers and other people who work with people over 60 years old. The elicitation and analysis of requirements, based on these elements, was the first step for the development of a platform and a mobile application, which will allow the collaboration of the various actors in actions to combat loneliness and promote active aging. This project helps mitigate the problem of loneliness and proposes new ways to combat it.",

This means that citizens have more options how to contact their city officials but more options also means higher complexity on both sides. Citizens need to know what channels are available and how to use them and responsible city officials need to observe more channels, which is time demanding. Since the research of non-emergency citizen reporting (NECR) systems is in its infancy, we introduce the study of 13 Czech regional capitals and their systems. In this study, we evaluate the existence of different types of NECR communication channels (phone, e-mail, electronic form, WebGis, and mobile application) and their quality based on four criteria (searchability, coverage of issues, visual geolocation, and display of sent reports).",

The application development process is described here from the design, implementation and evaluation. In the evaluation phase, we performed user tests with five participants with visual and motor disability. Thus, we record three metrics: effectiveness, success of the task (reaching one of the possible endings); efficiency, time needed to complete the story; and satisfaction, comfort and wellbeing of the user during the interaction. The result was positive, all participants successfully completed the application, and there were no withdrawals. Four in five wanted to repeat the experience and try to reach another end of the story.",

Knowing that the widespread access to the computer and the Internet is still made by the use of traditional devices, such as, the keyboard and mouse device (and these devices does not provide natural interaction between people and technology), it is necessary to train for the correct handling. Specifically, mouse usage requires movement control, hand posture and finger positioning, as well as, precision clicks for different functions (one click, two clicks, drag and click.) This training is often done in real interaction situations, that could led to inefficiency of use the digital environments and also user's frustration and discouragement. Thus, using simple and intuitive interfaces and providing a set of activities, we allow users to learn and train the motor coordination and basic movements with the mouse. The main results of the study showed that users had a pleasant experience of interaction, considered the interfaces intuitive and affirmed their availability to use it as a training tool.",

    "abstract": "The human brain and the human vision system, in front of a given scene, focuses on regions with more information. Many pieces of research in the field of psychology, neuropsychology and cognitive neurosciences, have detailed the way in which the extraction of such information is carried out, even proposing models of the functioning of visual attention. From these models, computer scientists have proposed computational variants, which imitate human visual attention. This field of research is known as saliency detection on images. In this paper, a new and simple approach for detecting visual saliencies based on Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding is presented. Our method first subdivides the image into full overlapped patches and runs a dictionary learning over them for obtaining its sparse representation. Then, by analyzing the sparse coding matrix, we compute how many image patches a dictionary atom affects in order to classify them as frequent or rare. Then, we calculate the saliency map of the image according to the composition of the image patches, i.e. an image patch is considered salient if it is mainly composed of rare atoms, an atom is rare whether it affects a few patches. Numerical results validate our method.",

    "abstract": "This solution aims at promoting well-being through Augmented Reality (AR) Sensing Based Technology, by developing a predictive system for treatment of specific phobias. Treatment of such mental disorders involves exposure therapy, which is usually conducted on a gradual and systematic basis, allowing modifications in the therapeutic setting with different exposure sessions. To meet these conditions, the therapist needs to evaluate the patient's responses in the previous sessions to define the content of the subsequent sessions. Therefore, we intend to use the psycho-physiological responses from the participants during the sessions through peripheral (i.e. ECG, EDA, EMG) and central nervous system responses (i.e. EEG) associated with emotional expression, as well as the participatory input to a visual analog scale (i.e. tactile feedback input system, avoiding huge hands movements and interruptions during carrying session) as an indicator of the subjective experience of emotions during the session (i.e. figures with different moods). This data will be also used to define the contents of each session, through a decision algorithm based on the history of the previous sessions for the same individual. All data resulting from this application will be recorded in a database to create individual reports on the session outcomes. The hardware to be used for psycho-physiological recording will be the Bitalino system (Plux) and the software for the AR development the NyARToolkit and Unity 3D software. We plan to carry out a pilot study with data collection in the laboratory setting to test the module related to the integration of psycho-physiological and participatory data in the AR system.",

The processes developed through the basic functions are the main joint that must be automated as it is necessary to have different aspects to support decision making and efficiency, reliability, interactivity, time optimization and various benefits for all the users. For this reason, the Israel Technological University has developed an Integrated System of Strategic Management, with generic characteristics for Higher Education Institutions, starting from the lifting of the process. Obtaining as result the optimization in the majority of processes, it is necessary to mention that the stage of development still is in a 74%.",

    "abstract": "The concept of autonomous learning has been resignified in recent years as a result of the expansion of the different forms of face-to-face, blended learning and online learning. Virtual education in higher education institutions has become an effective option to increase and diversify opportunities for access and learning, however, in this type of modality persists high rates of attrition, repetition and low average performance. academic. Recent research shows that the problem is accentuated because most students have difficulty planning, executing and monitoring their learning process autonomously. From this perspective, the research focuses on the analysis and development of a predictive model to identify problems in the autonomous learning and academic performance of university students studying a distance or virtual study modality. Unlike other studies, this work uses pedagogical techniques and algorithms from the analysis of learning to analyze and interpret academic data generated in virtual contexts. From this, information will be obtained and discovered to improve and optimize learning in order to contribute to the success of students with adequate prediction and intervention strategies.",

The performance in the use of this type of tools by people with psychosocial and psychomotor problems can be affected, and it is important to identify mechanisms to mitigate the impact of such constraints. The article presents a diagnostic model with a set of recommendations aiming to improve the comfort of the employee, with symptoms that may be temporary or chronic, at the workplace or workstation. The diagnostic algorithm takes into account demographic data and key words to infer the degree of severity of the psychosocial and psychomotor constraint of the person being analyzed. It can also contribute for companies to improve their understanding of how they can adapt their infrastructure at the workplace for greater comfort of the collaborator. Based on the selected operating procedure, the diagnostic algorithm will also provide specific recommendations on which assistive technology to use, including an estimate of the mitigation rate of the diagnosed constraint as well as information on possible fiscal/social benefits.",

The underlying surfing competitions are related to the two most known championships from the World Surf League (WSL): World Circuit Tour (WCT) and World Qualifying Series (WQS). At this level of competition, the athlete needs to have a direct communication with the trainer in order to obtain technical guidance or information about his/her performance, including scores obtained during the competition (e.g., wave, competing athletes), technical instructions for correcting maneuvers, urgent messages (e.g., change of board or momentary injuries). The proposed model is extensible to training contexts, where the athlete has to comply with training plans and can receive technical instructions from the coach. The proposed solution was designed for two views: Athlete's view for smartwatch-type equipment and Coach's view for tablet-type equipment. The coach, at land, has the role of an observer of the athlete's performance at sea. The methodology for development of this undergoing research project is based on the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) together with the User Centered Design (UCD) and Design Thinking (DT).",

The regulation will fundamentally reshape the way in which data is handled across every sector. The organizations had two years to implement it. As referred by many authors, the implementation of the regulation has not been an easy task for companies. The question we aim to answer in this study is how far the implementation of ISO 27001 standards might represent a facilitating factor to organizations for an easier compliance with the regulation.

Inability to realize the importance of Linear Algebra and its applications in technical subjects is one of the reasons of poor academic performance of students. The typical teaching approach separates the Linear Algebra's from technical subject. This does not necessarily promote student's awareness in both subjects. This paper presents a new teaching approach which combine Linear Algebra and Image Processing contents. The methodology presented is based in teaching Linear Algebra contents such as matrices and matrix transformation using Image Processing applications. This could lead to a whole new interesting learning environment, new teaching approaches that are more stimulating for students and more productive and dynamic for teachers.",

The context of public sector organizations, which does not fit into any of the four perspectives presented by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), led to the intertwining of the theme with the Social Era, predominantly people-driven or relationship-driven. The hypothesis formulation involves interconnecting convergent concepts, such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and e-participation, to potentiate the change of perspective, allowing to achieve the desired strategic alignment (IT-Business).",

Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China, a large area located in the water scarce upper Yellow River basin, is an example of this problem. This process requires information and communication technologies to bring knowledge to field technicians and farmers, favoring this development. On this context, the Web-based services are particularly effective in contributing to upgrading irrigation management, allowing an easy and automatic access to up-to-date access of simulation models and data, to broaden these tools to extension agricultural technicians to an effective means of assisting farmers. The purpose of this paper is to describe a research collaborative project to develop a web-based service to support on-farm design and management of irrigation systems to be applied to Hetao, to be applied by field technicians as an extensive tool, and by university students as a learning platform for training. This web tool is under development using a model-view-controller approach so it is easily adaptable while adjusting the simulator to the contexts, keeping it effective and robust. It is presented a demonstration example to highlight the interface characteristics, the input and output data, and the potential of this Web service.",

Thanks to our way of application in which the PTS technique is employed before the process of subdividing the bandwidth into the number of sub-bands, the PAPR minimization is carried out in a very simple and efficient manner. In the simulations, the PAPR reduction performance of the PTS technique is analyzed for different search numbers (SNs). In addition, the effect of PTS on the power spectral density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) performance of the UFMC system employing solid state power amplifier (SSPA) as a high power amplifier (HPA) is investigated for different input back off (IBO) and smoothness coefficient (p) values.",

They are individuals who get closer to the public ensuring more confidence in the brand or product they are promoting. That doesn't happen in traditional publicity as TV, radio or newspapers commercials. In other perspective, digital influencers can be relationship builders.

The electricity consumption derived from residential illumination is strongly reduced by assuming cleaner and more efficient technologies. One of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) considers responsible consumption and production of goods and services, in which the authors have focused this study on lighting loads on households. For this matter, IlluminApp has been developed. It is an educational tool, which allows to identify the benefits of the illumination technology conversion to residential users, as well as, an estimation on energy savings and the retrofit cost reduction by using different light bulbs technologies. The application uses a simple cost and energetic model to estimate: payback time, CO2emissions reduction, money, and energetic savings. This software is available in English and Spanish. The objective of this paper is to discuss in detail the interfaces of this application and its main functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Higher education students increasingly need to develop, during their academic journey, a set of personal, social and professional skills to allow their quick integration into the professional market. This requires a close collaboration between higher education institutions (HEIs) and the business/industrial context but also a change in HEIs pedagogical models, which should now be based on active learning methodologies, particularly when supported by information and communication technologies and applications like Serious Games. However, not all HEIs are ready to deal with such a radical change in educational paradigms. Thus an analysis of the Portuguese context was carried out, trying to characterize the situation and to find cases of good practices that could serve as motivating examples for the other institutions. This article reports this analysis which showed that, although still far from an optimal state, there has been a clear improvement in the past few years.",

Quito, the capital of Ecuador, presents serious mobility problems, with a significant amount of traffic both in the city center and in its main access routes. The proposal detail ed in this article aims to link Quito with several new generation technologies such as : Internet of Things (IoT), the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard for communication of heterogeneous sensors, and a system of notifications in real time using the protocol Communications Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). These technologies will be used for the development of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) that will take advantage of the mass deployment of smartphones in society as main sources of information, and also include Arduino and Raspberry modules to verify efficient communication. This ITS bases its operation on the crowsensing paradigm, which allows to reflect with greater accuracy the reality of the object of study, the more collaborators use the system; reaching up to 30% improvement in the situational awareness of the environment variable, traffic.",

    "abstract": "In today's globalised world where there is a growing need for international communication, non-native speakers (NNS) from a wide range of professional fields are increasingly called upon to write specialised texts in English. More often than not, however, the linguistic competence required to do so is well beyond that of the majority of NNS. While software applications can serve to assist NNS in their English writing tasks, most of the applications available are designed for users of English for general purposes as opposed to English for professional purposes. Therefore, these applications lack the specific vocabulary, style guidelines and common structures required in more specialised documents. Necessary modifications to meet the needs of English for professional purposes tend to be viewed as representing an overly complex and expensive task. To overcome these challenges, we present a software called O-WEAA (Ontology-Writing English Assistant Architecture) which makes use of an ontology that represents the knowledge which, according to our formalisation, is required to write most types of specialised professional documents in the English language. Our formalisation of the required knowledge is based on an exhaustive linguistic analysis of several written genres. The proposed software is composed of two parts: i) a web application named Acquisition Interface Module, which allows experts to populate the ontology with new data and ii) a user-friendly, general web interface named Writing Assistant Interface Module which guides the user throughout the writing process of the English document in the specific domain described in the ontology.",

Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), this research studies the impact of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use in the use of social networks and analyzes the audacity and technological anxiety of the elderly as external antecedents of the model. All the hypotheses are validated and the use of socialnetworks by the older adult in Chile is explained by 38%.",

To achieve this, the idea is to (1) enhance and extend a system for real-time measurement of the Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs) of a walking humanoid robot, (2) to develop a robot controller, and (3) to use machine learning techniques to interpret the GRFs and thus adapt the robot controller in order to achieve a robot able to walk on different grounds. The overall system contribution is the improvement and diversity of humanoids locomotion capacities, leading to a more easily integration of these robots into different areas where they can collaborate with humans.",

This methodology consists of two phases. Phase 1 evaluates all involved agents (child, parents, product) independently and pointing out that the latter two present some inconsistencies due to the structure of the model.

A study appended [20] considered the variables gaming narrative, social interaction and health condition as direct predictors of intention to use digital games, proposing a model of use and acceptance of the extended technologies. In this context, and in view of this identified gap, this research proposal seeks to identify characteristics that facilitate and/or promote the acceptance of electronic games, their use and the learning of information and communication technologies by the elderly population.

In this work, through an aggregation operator, a consensus mechanism is proposed to establish the order in which resources are allocated to groups of processes. Consensus is understood as the agreement that must be reached for the allocation of all the resources requested by each group of processes. To model this consensus, it is necessary to take into account that the processes may form groups of processes or be independent, the state of the nodes where each of them is located, the computational load, the number of processes, the process priorities, the use of the CPU, the use of the main memory, virtual memory, etc. These characteristics make it possible to evaluate the conditions for agreeing on the order in which resource allocations will be made, ordered by process group.",

Within these, it has highlighted among other tools instead of the didactic forums where students among themselves and students and teaching teams could discuss and in general build knowledge within a collaborative context. The data coming from these forums have been analyzed, with different techniques, and have allowed obtaining some very interesting conclusions. However, in recent academic years there is a clear trend of migration of collaborative work that previously occurred in the forums to social networks and mobiles. This poses a problem since these tools are not coordinated by the teaching teams. A preliminary work analyzes this trend and points out the consequences to which it may give rise. The present work exposes a methodology to automate the information obtained from Facebook working group, which have been designed by the students themselves.",

    "abstract": "The convolutional neural networks (CNN) are considered as a particular case of the Deep Learning neural networks, and have been widely used for the extraction of features in images, audio files or text recognition. For the automatic extraction of features from multispectral images, many researchers have appealed to the use of CNN models, which integrate layers with different structures in context with the solution of a problem, which suggests quite a challenge. That is why, in this article, we propose a method to evaluate the stability in the design of convolutional layers for labeling and identification of palm cultivation units from multispectral images. The structure of the proposed convolutional layer will be given in terms of a fuzzy feature map, obtained as a result of the Cartesian product of three vegetation indices commonly used to evaluate plant vigor in this type of crops (NDVI, GNDVI, RVI), represented as compact maps (radial basis functions). The stability in the design will be given in terms of the dominance of the main diagonal that defines the structure of a convolutional layer obtained as a result of the Cartesian product of two compact maps that represent the same multispectral image.",

From the bibliographic research that studies and documents the relationship of the older with technology and the personal experience of teaching Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to seniors, we present methodologies and tools that can provide the elderly with the skills to take advantage of technology potential and exercise easy and efficiently full citizenship.

As it happens with other food productset, the traceability of fish or fishery products is very important, either to inform the consumer about the path of the fish through the value chain or to recall fish lots in case of threats to the public health. This paper reports on the analysis phase of a project that aims to create a platform for integrating all the information about the origin, and all steps of the course of the fish, including quality information, until reaching the final consumer.",

Due to its big dimension, it presents some difficulties regarding its organization. The lack of cohesion of the parade during its course is one of the issues observed that originates several and large empty spaces, which end up to discredit the parade. This paper presents the study the issue related with the Parade's organization/planning, by proposing a solution based on low-cost technologies. In this work we intend to study the problem of empty spaces, proposing a solution based on low cost technologies and evaluating the performance of this solution with its potential users. In this way, a process of collect information was initiated through the observation of the Parade, an interview with the organization and a inquiry of the collaborators and another one for the drivers. Based on the collected information, it is proposed a solution that uses smartphones to interconnect through a mobile application and also a web management application, in order to monitor the Parade and help in suppressing empty spaces. The proposal was evaluated to its potential users through a functional prototype. Usability and User Experience tests were performed and the results were promising. It is intended to validate the proposed solution in the field and extend the proposal to other Parade.",

    "abstract": "The present study identifies the potential effects of Artificial Intelligence in organizations, in the future of work and of the labor market, as well as its effects on lifestyle, livingconditions and society. Towards answering our research questions of an exploratory nature, focusing on the prospects for the future rather than on the present reality, we interviewed a set of experts who reconcile a good understanding of new emerging technologies of Artificial Intelligence with a good knowledge of organizational, social and market dynamics. The interviewees' responses were compared with a set of assumptions based on the revised literature. Thus, the semi-structured questions and their analysis naturally involve qualitative data, since the prospective nature of the present study does not allow the collection and subsequent processing of quantitative data with the necessary scope. From the results and analysis thereof, it is concluded that, regardless of the diversity existing among the respondents in terms of generational and academic training, the answers converge on the expectations of increases in efficacy, quality of service, in productivity and efficiency, and reductions on the number of employees in organizations resulting from automation. In addition, they mentioned the possible disappearance of functions and even functional areas, as well as the automation of many functions and the emergence of more qualified job opportunities.",

We used mainly data from google trends to determine the evolution of search by topics., research area, or simple expressions. It allowed us to reckon that artificial intelligence (AI)suffered a lack of interest until 2012. Then it became an increasingly popular field since 2014. This is due to the progression of machine learning and data science. Results show a cumulative search of data science since 2012.",

    "abstract": "The recent regulation of the audit profession in European Union, has imposed a higher level of harmonization among member states, in particular with respect to their oversight systems, increasing organizational and functional independence from professional bodies, as well as the transparency of the process and its results. However, the diversity existing up to the deadline for applying the new rules, as well as unsatisfactory results in other contexts of this oversight paradigm, raise doubts about an increase in the quality of the audit coming from this new model. This research aims to anticipate, through bivariate analysis the association between audit quality and independence of the audit oversight, regarding Public Interest Entities in European Unions in the pre-regulation period (2009-2015). We conclude that in some cases more independence is not associated with superior audit quality, but there's a positive impact of more transparency.",

The analysis showed that the turnover for the activity sectors under study (lodging and restoration and similars) does not always follows the Benford's Law and the behavior is different depending on whether the company presents positive or negative results. The analysis of the information considering different financial situations enables to reinforce the importance of applying the Benford's Law as a control tool to be used by auditors.",

An Integrated Reporting presents a hybrid situation because it includes financial information that is subjected to a mandatory audit, and non-financial information that can be assured in a voluntary basis. In this way, the inclusion of assurance information can be seen through a legitimation lens representing the organizations' effort to increase legitimacy. The motivation behind this paper is to discuss the assurance presented on Integrated Reporting. The research's objective is to provide an analysis on the differences between companies from different geographical origins related to the assurance provided on Integrated Reporting. The methodological approach is characterized by a qualitative study on the assurance included in Integrated Reporting. The empirical analysis is related to the analysis of the reports of 45 organizations. We find that the company's geographical origins implicate differences in the information disclosed related to assurance. The paper's contribution consists on new insights into the emergent field of assurance on Integrated Reporting with the increase of the understanding of the assurance report's characteristics, which are disclosed by companies from different geographical settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper intends to characterize the food waste of a unit, in which a Collective Restoration Company (ERC) operates, through the daily collection of data and monitoring of the amount of waste produced, per meal period, in the observed time horizon. The treatment and analysis of the collected data allowed to point out a set of performance indicators that could characterize food waste over time, according to the following categories: i) food waste index (ADI), ii) number of meals waste “(NRD) and iii) generated waste accumulator (ADG). For these indicators, several representation (visualization and synthesis) supports were identified and studied to create a dashboard that is intended to be objective and intuitive concerning the reading of waste generated in an ERC. The aim of the work in progress is to develop a proposal for the representation of waste indicators, which allows the identification of consumption patterns, contributing to daily planning and decision making in ERCs. Developments in progress are intended to contribute to reducing the levels of waste through ongoing support in the planning and preparation of menus. Resource management and good operating practices require simple, objective, replicable and ideally inexpensive collection procedures. In this sense, a compromise solution is presented between the operationalization of the collection (observations and representation), the details of the data collected and their synthesis and visualization in an operational dashboard. The applicability of the proposal under development (indicators and dashboard) was subject to some tests with real data of an ERC, being the current study a first contribution to the treatment of the sustainability problems generated by the wastes produced in this sector of activity.",

    "abstract": "Robotic process automation (RPA) is the use of software with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required only humans to perform. In short, there is at least a problem with traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems, as they cannot suggest the best combination of tasks, people and timings, which can increase the benefits of running them, while reducing the costs and risk factors. Yet, it is an irrefutable fact that the current business environment is highly dynamic. On the one hand, we need to be more efficient to execute what is operational and obvious, releasing scarce resources for more critical areas. Then, dealing with business process management and automation, a common claimed benefit is associated with the improvement of performance. In addition to this and other potential benefits, we also highlight some potential operational risks from the adoption of AI-based systems like RPA. The acceleration in the business context makes it more difficult to predict what changes will occur and how they can affect the technological solutions used in the increasingly automated business processes. We point out the fact that immature or not well-trained models can eventually decrease productivity and increase errors from unsupported or even wrong decisions. We present a case study in the banking sector, which illustrates some examples of benefits and risks arising from BPM solutions that use AI-related agents/artifacts.",

Nowadays, it is hard to find a business that does not have an account on any social network, and we can safely say that social media is a crucial aspect for any business enterprise - to sell their products, to be seen and, obviously, to make more money. We talk about the possibility to mix innovation, business strategy and social media. To complement this research, we focused our work on a Portuguese start-up - Strain - that intends to prove marketing is changing and that it actually welcomes the change, with social networks at the base of their business. They intend to use online influencers to promote the image of a brand, free of charge, and earn discounts on it. It is, indeed, a win-win situation, where each of the three parts (the company itself, clients and Strain) is a winner one way or the other.",

    "abstract": "Modern society is witnessing an increase in average life expectancy. Nowadays, stroke represents one of the major causes of disabilities worldwide usually among older adults. The stroke is a type of cerebrovascular accident that may cause motricity and cognitive impairments. The recovery process usually lacks a patient-centric strategy, relying on a set of long, painful and difficult physiotherapy sessions. At the same time, the lack of resources from health services and the lack of engagement by patients may lead to an incomplete recovery training program. This research presents the game design process and evaluation of a digital game in two immersive environment displays (Monitor and Head Mounted Display, both with a Leap Motion Controller). “A Priest in the Air“ intends to complement the traditional stroke recovery program with a digital game for the mid/final stage of the upper-limb motor function rehabilitation.",

Historically, the tax favors the financing of economic activity through debt, the so-called debt bias, led to over-indebtedness of national firms with harmful effects on the economy, aggravated in a context of increasing international competition. This study investigates the impact of the new tax framework for corporate financing on firms' leverage, focusing on the analysis of the trienniums 2010-2012 and 2014-2016, pre- and post-alteration, respectively. Our findings suggest that after 2013, the firms covered by the new regime adjusted their capital structures, which means they reduced their average leverage levels. Moreover, we find a negative relationship between leverage and average effective tax rate which, contrarily to what would be expected, was not weakened, but slightly reinforced, by the new regime.",

In the last decade, this digital transformation has led to a change in the behavior of marketers and managers around the world. It should be noted that, although there are still some fears arising from the use of social media in the B2B context, it is unquestionable that these have become essential in the design of a competitive strategy. The purpose of our study is to identify the main determinants of the adoption of social media in the B2B context. Based on a sample of 223 workers from B2B companies, the structural equations model was used to test the relationships among the variables learning, memorability, errors, usability, usefulness, social influence, satisfaction, trust, intention to use social media and adoption of social media. The results showed that all variables considered are fundamental in explaining the adoption of social media.",

The SEDUCE 2.0 Project is one of those examples that, in addition to developing the online social community miOne, aims to study the impact of its use on older adults' psychosocial variables - quality of life, perceived stress and social support networks. Thus, this paper aims to analyze what kind of studies have already been carried out, what methodology and what sample are used, results and what limitations and gaps are found, in order to provide guidelines for the Project. A systematic literature review has been done, structured from original publications, dated from 2008 to 2019 and based on the concepts: quality of life, information and communication technologies, older adults, aging and active aging. Although there were few studies, the results identify that is important to pay particular attention to the selection and distribution of the participants by groups and to the size of the sample. In addition, they reinforce the positive relationship between the use of technologies and the maintenance or improvement of quality of life, reduction of the feeling of loneliness, and promotion of active aging.",

Promoting physical activity is a priority challenge and audiovisual content can give an important help to achieve this aim. Nevertheless, it is fundamental that the potential consumers of these contents identify themselves with them and can use them easily to support their practice of physical activity. In this paper, the authors describe a strategy that was followed to develop a set of audiovisual contents potentially capable of supporting the elderly to perform certain physical exercises. This strategy considered various preferences revealed by this group and involved them throughout the development process. Given the widespread use of mobile phones and their potential to be used to support physical activity, this paper also presents an approach for making these contents available within a mobile application that supports physical activity. The results of this stage of a broader study corroborates the idea that older people are predisposed to consume this type of content and recognize it as valuable. It also contributes to better understand in what way this type of content can be delivered in a mobile application that is being developed to support older adults to carry out physical activities plans.",

This paper presents the context of appropriate analytical methods for anomalies' and fraud detection, demonstrates and systematizes their application through the analysis of the SAFT-PT file, taking six months of sales in an Small Enterprise and analyzes and discusses the results, proposing improvements in internal control. This paper is intended to contribute to the demystification of the complexity of the analyzes, evidencing the opportunity to repeat tasks with identical data.",

The size and the complexity of the entity are the most relevant factors for the voluntary creation of internal auditing. This study aims to evaluate the state of art of internal auditing at the municipalities in Portugal. The specific objective is to analyse how the internal audit is found in the municipalities, seeking to verify if there has been evolution over time, in order to evaluate if there is a greater number of municipalities with the internal audit service/office and those that still do not have, what causes them. The research methodology used was the data collection by a questionnaire, that was sent to the 308 municipalities through electronic mail. Through the results obtained, it can be affirmed that there is a greater number of municipalities participating in this type of research, that there is a slight increase of the number of municipalities which have the internal audit service/office and, moreover, the smaller municipalities are more sensitized to the importance of this theme. The main reason found for the lack of this service is the lack of human resources, however it is verified that some municipalities intend to implement this service in the near future.",

It was possible to verify that there are many complementary aspects between the requirements of NP EN ISO 9001: 2015 and the scope areas of the Internal Quality Assurance System of the A3ES, concluding that the quality certification presents benefits to higher education institutions, leaving best prepared for A3ES assessments.

    "abstract": "There have been technological advances in all areas, especially in maritime navigation systems. Design changes and the increase of automatisms, leads to transformations in the interaction between the operator and the decision support system, also reverting to changes in the cognitive processes, in the processes of information search and processing, such as situational awareness, anticipatory thinking. These changes can affect operators, both positively or negatively, and may have the opposite effect to the intended. They can cause an increase of the cognitive effort or until the undervaluation of events that are relevant to the safety of navigation. The present article presents preliminary results of a study that aims to analyse the work performed by the RADAR operator and the cognitive processes present during a period of great cognitive activity for all elements of the ship bridge. The data are being collected on Portuguese naval vessels sailing in high density areas of navigation and proximity to hazards, in the ports of Lisbon and Setubal. Records are made using Eye Trackers operated in the RADAR operator and by observing their work in a team, supported by audio and video recordings of all the activity on the ship's bridge. These data are complemented by two questionnaires for assessment of situational awareness and work effort (SART and NASA-TLX), totalizing the data of three questionnaires. The results suggest that the RADAR operator is subject to a high cognitive effort and that the interaction with the team is very important for this to maintain a good level of situational knowledge.",

Internal audit functions are therefore encouraged to use technology-based tools such as GAS in the execution of their duties in an effort to respond to its various stakeholders' needs and expectations in an efficient and effective manner. GAS comes with a number of different functionalities that the internal auditor can use. This paper explores the purpose of the use of GAS as a data analytics tool by internal audit functions in Australia. The research results indicate that respondents are utilising GAS for a variety of purposes. The top five purposes for which the respondents make use of GAS often to always during separate internal audit engagements are: (1) for conducting full population analyses; (2) to identify transactions with specific characteristics or control criteria for tests of controls purposes; (3) to evaluate fraud risks; (4) to obtain audit evidence about control effectiveness; and (5) for selecting random samples for tests of controls purposes from key electronic files.",

The next phase will be to know how the human being thinks, determining which are the elements that most influence their thinking, highlighting among them the emotion and empathy, both fundamental elements for the creation of a persuasive discourse. And both in deep relationship with the way in which the player relates to the game (Engage) Next, we will work on the elements of rhetoric and its relationship with persuasion.

In principle, objective factors are expressed by numerical values being classified by limit values or ranges, while subjective factors express values that can hardly be represented numerically. The problem of evaluation tends to worsen when events must be compared, and a selection or ordering must be performed. The current work presents a proposal of solution to help manage the demands related to the process of prediction, evaluation and classification of shutdowns in Brazilian Hydropower Plants for a regulatory agency. The method, by weighing a relevant set of factors, aims to indicate the projects which should be prioritized by the inspection team, based on criteria data mining techniques such as logistic regression. Its application allowed to measure and guarantee the consistency of the judgments along the process, minimizing risks, promoting more rationalization and administrative transparency.",

This first ongoing prototype was developed using the Java programming language, two Arduino microcontroller, 12 servomotors, 12 LEDs and connection cables. The teacher types a word in the input form, then select the time delay, then the system sends each letter signal to the Arduino hardware and then it sends to the servomotor the signal to lift the LEDs, finally the blind student touches the lifted LEDs to interpret the character, syllable or word. The cost of the hardware used is USD$ 40 approximately. The prototype was tested by teachers and blind students, teachers manifest their conformity with the system functionality, because it is more intuitive and easier to use compared with traditional paper and awl based system, and blind students can learn Braille literacy in less time than before.",

The integration of older people into social life, as well as creating the conditions for them to age in a participatory, independent and autonomous way require that various stakeholders in society organize themselves and develop solutions according to individuals' needs. Most of the elderly face modifications at the sensory level, namely in terms of visual acuity, which can be manifested by loss of visual quality as a normal consequence of the aging process or by eye diseases that are typical in advanced ages (e.g.: cataracts). EyeSenior intends to be a service that gathers news from several informative sources, allowing seniors with blindness or low vision to access the information. Thus, the project aims to promote seniors' autonomy and independence as well as their integration and participation in community life.",

The way each naval unit currently collects and processes data makes difficult to consolidate information in the process of analysis and decision making. This work describes the design of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution aimed at obtaining a unified view of operational information from the Navy. For this purpose, it was necessary to conceive, design and implement a system that would allow the collection, treatment, integration, consolidation, analysis and visualization of the data contained in the operational data shared by naval units, in order to generate information relevant to a more effective and efficient decision making. The Business Intelligence system presented is based on an analytical processing system whose data is transferred to a data warehouse and then to a data mart. The solution of this system was validated through a survey applied to target users. The survey responses allowed to gather important information with the purpose of improving the practicability and usefulness in future iterations with the BI solution developed.",

This type of tourism, in the growth phase, seeks local development managed from a community base. The methodology used consists of an exploratory analysis. Its purpose is to establish a state of the art that allows understanding the importance of social capital - in its structural (organizational structure) and cognitive (norms, values and trust) dimensions - as a variable that contributes to the startup and operation of community tourism. In this line, we propose a qualitative analysis with in-depth interviews to analyze the state of social capital in the parishes of Mangahurco, Cazaderos and Bolaspamba of Zapotillo Canton - Loja, Ecuador.",

    "abstract": "In the case of Ecuador, the tourism sector is seen as a key element for the economic and social development of the country. In this context, the research presented has as its scope of study the Zapotillo Canton of the province of Loja (Ecuador), specifically the parishes of Mangahurco, Cazaderos and Bolaspamba, a region in the south of the country that has important economically and socially depressed areas, but has enough tourist attractions to captivate tourists and visitors. The main objective of the research is to know, on the part of the actors involved in the management and tourist planning of the areas of study, their opinion in relation to: the tourist development presented by the parishes; their role as key agents in the development of the zones and; their involvement in the application of environmental policies. The methodology is based on the use of secondary and primary sources, through the development in the latter case of qualitative research based on in-depth interviews. The results show that Mangahurco, Cazaderos and Bolaspamba have great potential to bet on the development of a model of rural community tourism, however there is still a long way to go, so it is recommended to work on socially responsible proposals and in the promotion of plans, which seek social inclusion, sustainability and conservation of nature and culture in the three parishes studied.",

    "abstract": "At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, traditional linear television began, with greater precision, a transformation process towards online television, which continues to this day. This evolution has allowed almost unlimited access to the content, without having to be subject to the programming grid of a television, now there is the possibility of seeing what you want, when and where you want. However, an increase in the demand for content through television brings with it several disadvantages: the need to adapt to different screens and devices, the speed of connection, the location or the validation of the subscribers. The above generates a problem in the fragmentation of the audience, both for advertisers and for distributors, who affirm a sustainable business model. For example, the subscription to video on demand (SVOD) model, as offered by Netflix or HBO, makes programmers and distributors address some of the concerns of advertisers to increase the flow of investment in television advertising. Some of them would be: Scale, it is not enough to buy time in a program that is broadcast in a predetermined time zone; Measurement, the gross audience index (GRP) metric is no longer as simple as a result of the different broadcast platforms and devices; In technology, we find users who want to access content from different devices, or even want to see a series on their smartphone while they are on the train and can continue when they get home, this time on the television in their living room. The evolution in which television is immersed affects both the audience and advertising. In recent years, the effort is focused on finding a solution to the fragmentation of the audience, with the consequent obtaining of the optimization of budget revenues and advertising campaigns. The work presented here carries out an analysis of the audiences, through the study of the websites of four SVOD platforms: Netflix, Blockbuster, Hulu and HBO.",

A tool was proposed for the elderly public that flee from the care themes, physical activity, social interaction, drug use and cognitive stimulation, a learning object about photography was proposed, which is described in this article. The methodology used was Design Science Research. The learning object has a social network and it is believed that its inclusion may be a differential factor for its acceptance and use by the elderly public.

This is particularly critical when working with frail participants, vulnerable groups, or sensitive settings. How can we ensure that the technology we develop and/or evaluate does not harmfully impact our research participants, even if unintentionally? Drawing on a case study of a communication app developed to address loneliness and social isolation in later life, as well as on years of ethnographic fieldwork with older people, we argue for an ethical display approach. This approach: i) bridges procedural and situational ethics, ii) engages ethics throughout the research process, and iii) maps both positive and negative `unintended consequences', applying Robert K.

Different studies identify the Internet as a source of information highly regarded by journalists. The objective of our research is to determine the importance of social media in the agenda-setting. This objective aims to know if the immediacy of social media determines the agenda-setting on health journalism in Spain, or if it is still delimited by traditional media. We also seek to find out if journalists establish differences in social networks depending on the type of organization. After implementing a survey of 1232 Spanish journalists, we determined that social media are not a primary source of information. Given the time invested in its use, it can be confirmed that the results support that in the current practice of health journalism, social media are considered as a tool present in the daily journalistic exercise, although they are not a sufficiently consolidated source of information to be considered a primary source.",

Identifying and analyzing the representation of older people in animated films can be an important tool to understand how animated films represent the aging process and the elderly, which represent a strong influence on the child and adolescent public.

In recent years, the increase in competition and competitiveness among companies has grown exponentially increasing the variety of products in the market, so the development of business strategies to ensure their long-term survival is increasingly complicated. In addition, the changes produced in consumer purchasing behavior, promote the creation of new business models that continue to attract and motivate customers as well as a new concept of marketing adapted to this situation, capable of establishing new communication channels. Traditional marketing, conventional advertising and reduced price strategies, lose effectiveness in a new era in which the consumer acquires power and prominence, so in addition to the improvement and evolution of the characteristics of the products, it must be provided attention to the customer experience, since the potential lies in conquering the emotions of consumers. Neuromarketing offers state-of-the-art techniques to test minds based on information resident in the brain and their preferences. In this way, it is possible to predict the behavior of consumers more effectively than with traditional market research techniques, providing a competitive advantage for companies in order to satisfy the emotional needs of their customers, by providing unique experiences of consumption with the purpose of persuading them in the decision making and fidelizing them in the future.",

It is noted that digital games may have an impact on the health of older adults, but little research has been done on location-based mobile games and this audience. This article reviews the literature focusing on the effects that location-based mobile games have on the lives of seniors and how these investigations are being conducted. There were five studies that investigate this category of games with the aspects related to health and the social interaction of senior citizens.

I find evidence, that it cannot be concluded that the audit quality measured by the dimension of the audit firm influences the cost of debt of the voluntary audited companies. This may be due to the fact that on small firms, the quality differences between large and small audit firms decreased when the risk of litigation is weak and therefore what matter is the audit and not the auditor.",

    "abstract": "Political communication has evolved to new practices that, in the field of television, involve going beyond the borders of purely informative formats and working with the presence of candidates and institutional managers in entertainment programs, the so-called infoentertainment spaces, present in practically the programming of all generalist chains. In this context, the electoral debates also evolve in form and content, abandoning the rigid classical format and moving towards a type of program with a greater weight of entertainment, more purely television. This paper analyzes the presence on television of the candidates of the main political parties in the General Cortes Elections held in Spain on December 20, 2015. For this is taken as a sample the intervention of all of them in the Mediaset (Telecinco) morning magazine El Programa de Ana Rosa.",

In this context, the present research carries out a study of 125 articles from scientific journals of the last decade, in order to obtain an overview of the scientific topics and methodologies addressed in order to determine the most widely used and their potentialities, as well as, identify if there is an innovation in the methods that investigate radio on the internet. The results are obtained through a methodology mainly quantitative, but that has required qualitative support for the analytical observation of different general and methodological variables of the publications. In addition, the variables were correlated, which allowed to identify the work done by the Latin American researchers in the area. Among the main findings of the research is the scarce research generated from Latin American countries, as well as the large number of descriptive and exploratory studies that do not show greater innovation in the techniques and instruments applied.",

From the professionals' understanding through suggestions and criticisms regarding the use of assistive technology, a new version of the CNV Mobile Pro application was proposed for alternative communication of the institutionalized elderly with professionals and family members. It is a qualitative, exploratory-descriptive study, with a cross-sectional design, carried out with ten health professionals from eight longstay institutions for the elderly. The data were collected between July and October of 2018 by the Focal Group technique and were systematized by NVivo 12, which generated categories of similarities and correlations, using the Bardin content analysis. Professionals understood the benefit, barrier, ease, acceptance and adequacy regarding the use of assistive technology. According to the professionals' understanding, the assistive technology should be used according to the profile of the elderly, older professionals and demented elderly had difficulties to use assistive technology, indicating that regarding the use for the communication of relatives with the elderly this aspect should be also contemplated. We will seek to develop new assistive technologies based on the proposed conceptual model.",

The main goals are to emphasise the importance of process modelling during the data collection, analysis and visualization procedures and to show the importance of inefficiency reduction in information flows. BPMN 2.0 was used to identify the data sources and information flows and Microsoft Power BI was used to show that it is possible to reduce waste in the processes. A combination of Lean Thinking, Information Systems and Industry 4.0 principles and methods is used. The foreseen result is an information system that connects people, data and processes in a way that efficiency is gained in the daily tasks, in the decision-making processes and in the identification and elimination of non-value-added activities.",

This paper addresses this problem describing a software solution based on the use of mobile devices, as smartphones, smartwatches, and identification tags all linked to an information system. This work was done in close collaboration with a national public rehabilitation hospital center to really understand the underlying problems, to identify the main requirements and challenges, and to help in the testing and validation process. The final prototype demonstrated the viability of the solution and that it could be deployed in a real set-up without significant effort.",

This paper proposes a new model, called the Information Technology Acceptance and Use Model (MAUTI), which allows an understanding of the acceptance and use of IT in an organizational environment, and can be used when designing, developing, using, improvement or replacement of a system. Based on some of the factors considered in the most popular models, this model combines new factors in order to obtain a better explanation of the phenomenon of acceptance and use of technologies, reaching an explained variance of 58%. Its high degree of explanation justifies its use by organizations as an instrument for evaluating the role of their IT, its reorganization or remodeling with a view to its effective use by employees.",

Based on some of the factors considered in the most popular models, this model combines new factors in order to obtain a better explanation of the phenomenon of acceptance and use of technologies, reaching an explained variance of = 58%. Its highdegree of explanation justifies its use by organizations as an instrument for evaluating the role of their IT, its reorganization or remodeling with a view to its effective use by employees.",

Likewise, there are elements that affect the organizational culture due to the lack of transparency and dissemination of management processes. It is necessary to mention that communication strategies are invisible in many institutional realities because they are confused with advertising schemes. By virtue of this, the Stakeholders are considered as interest groups, where the companies carry out actions to satisfy the needs of these communities, in order to develop their strategic objectives and corporate goals. In this article we analyze the incidence of these specific groups that consume the services and products of Ecuadorian companies. Reflections that are applied from the relevance of the work of the Stakeholders as a strategy.",

The use of technological artifacts, including robotics, has gained prominence in the educational area due to the possibility of developing low cost prototypes, allowing the use of a larger portion of the school community. Since the pedagogical process can be benefited by the use of artifacts to demonstrate concepts, a research was developed to identify which technologies are or may be appropriate for use in the teaching-learning process in the Brazilian Basic Education. This paper presents the results of the research from the perspective of teachers of this phase of education. From these results, it is possible to guide future work related to the development of pedagogical proposals mediated by these technologies, mainly related to the use of demonstration artifacts.",

The Human Machine Interface (HMI) for manufacturing process control is a key component within this concept. This work presents the process of developing an HMI, supported by web technology, and adapted for an additive manufacturing equipment. The HMI should allow monitoring and manipulation of its parameters by providing the operator with a tool capable of providing timely information on the manufacturing process as well as the equipment itself and should allow direct control of the instrument. The paper presents and describes, the adopted methodology, the proposed architecture, the prototypes and the studies with the users and the respective results of the usability tests. Users were involved in the design process. The final interface was assessed very positively by the users (operators).",
