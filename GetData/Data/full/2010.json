    "abstract": "In the past several years, various optimization algorithms had been implemented on the project total cost minimization problem. Lately, it was developed an application that serves as a central platform that integrates all those previous implementations. Currently, such platform allows the access and execution of each one of the other utilities as modules/plugins. Each of which can be configured to execute optimizations over different projects. Although the platform already saves the optimization results, it lacks a suitable processing mechanism that would ease the cross analysis over all the utilities. Therefore, we want to include capture and analysis of results into the platform in order to properly aggregate them in a results database. Such database could then be queried for numerous purposes being the performance evaluation, across the optimization utilities, one of the first. In this project we analyze a total of five heterogeneous optimization utilities, all coded in Java, using algorithms based on dynamic programming and global optimization. The heterogeneity poses a challenge which we overcame by establishing a common results storage language, by means of XML files.",

With the aim of identifying similar itineraries as well as suggesting car sharing hypothesis that respect the criteria defined by the system's user, one has developed algorithms. One of the main goals of this project is related with the need to decrease the number of cars which on a daily basis go into cities, reducing thus traffic jams on urban areas. By achieving this goal, one intends to reduce gas emissions which cause the greenhouse effect, protecting thus the environment.",

Thus the routing and scheduling of vehicles tend to receive a focused mission, observing the requirements of the consumer market and end customer within the urban distribution logistics. The aim of this paper is to apply a neuro fuzzy network to forecast the behavior of the urban traffic of the city of São Paulo aided routing in a hierarchy of three levels: strategic represented by forecasting the behavior of traffic, represented by the tactical and operational routing dynamics represented by routing algorithms. The methodology of the work consists in the capture of relevant events that affect the flow of traffic of the city of São Paulo and implementation of a neuro fuzzy network trained with these events to predict the behavior of traffic. This paper will present the partial results of the use of neuro fuzzy network in predicting the behavior of the traffic of the city of São Paulo.",

    "abstract": "Software packages for educational purposes are increasingly important for classroom use, because they are a valuable way to motivate learning. However, the resources available on the market, with the designation of educational software, often have dubious quality. This led the authors to reflect on the process of evaluating the quality of a given educational software and develop tools that allow to measure its quality. This paper presents the results of the technical (software) and educational (guidelines for the didactic exploration) evaluation of Courseware Sere - The Human Being and Natural Resources - made by students of 2nd cycle of basic education (10 to 12 year old). The results indicate that the resource is easy to use, even for students who do not regularly use computers. It can also be concluded that the evaluation of educational resources, made by end-users, allows to correct issues related to usability (navigation and interaction), and to ensure the adequacy of resource to the target levels of education.",

In this paper, we apply the method of systematic review to identify, extract and analyze the main proposals on modeling conceptual ETL processes for DWs.

Although essential, the activities involved in this complex process do not take place in many higher education institutions due to the lack of appropriate practices and an adequate technological support that sustain these practices. To overcome this complex problem, a conceptual and a technological infrastructure was proposed and integrated into a Student Relationship Management (SRM) system. The SRM system is associated with Business Intelligence concepts and technologies used to obtain knowledge about the students and to support the decision making process. To validate the SRM system relevance, a set of applications cases were carried out in real contexts and supported by the implemented prototype. This paper presents some of the results obtained through the prototype implementation and on the analysis of the several actions that were carried out under the principles of the SRM practice.",

    "abstract": "Digital Identity is the representation of the overall known information about a user across online applications. Digital identity management is the collection of processes, policies and technologies to manage the complete life cycle of users' identities, such as creation, management, and destruction. Most web applications request users to have a registered digital identity in their system to allow access to their services. Having a myriad of digital identities to manage, users tend to take less protective measures regarding their identities and become reluctant at the moment of adopting (other) applications. Furthermore, having the personal information scattered across many systems, concerns users about its whereabouts and many times leads them to provide false information. The Federation identity concept was introduced to address user digital identity management overload by creating a framework for systems interoperability. It establishes a set of rules and standards in order to create a reliable and secure namespace for the exchanging of identity information between source (usually users via their identity provider) and target (usually web applications), allowing users to access several web applications seamlessly by using only one digital identity. This paper reflects on an approach to the federated identity management, by using a collection of federation standards for the developing of a federated identity provider to enable users to access the web applications seamlessly using a publicly available strong identification mechanism: the National Electronic Citizen Identity Card. Our aim with the development of the GlobaliD identity provider is to take a step further in the digital identity management, making it more versatile, responsible, anonymity and privacy-safe, trustworthy and thus secure.",

AOP aims at enhancing modularity and thus solving the problem of crosscutting concerns by capturing them into new units of modularity called aspects. With the increasing usage and acceptance of AOP, the task of assuring aspect-oriented systems' correctness has become a challenge, mainly due to its nature. Although several testing techniques have been applied and improved for object-oriented programs through the years, there is still the problem of selecting and verifying which ones can be effectively applied to AOP. This paper presents a perspective on how AOP can improve quality (when applied correctly), identifies a set of key testing issues that arise with AOP and presents weaknesses and strengths of the existing solutions to improve quality in AOP.",

But the way this information is managed does not allow us to create a suitable organization of the data. It's necessary to define more powerful data structures that support new and useful functionalities for the viewer. The main objective in this research is to define the specification for an ontology-based content system that optimizes the way the viewer accesses to the data. First, this system reads the information that is contained in the transport stream. Then, it arranges and storages all the data using ontologies, adding information from other sources when necessary. Finally it allows the user to perform searches and offers him recommendations according to his preferences.",

One way to discover defects and increase the quality of GUIs is through testing. Test cases can be created manually or produced automatically from a model of the GUI. The size and complexity of GUIs makes it unpractical to do extensive manual testing. However, creating a model of the GUI in order to generate automatically test cases is also a laborious task. This paper presents a reverse engineering approach for diminishing the effort required for constructing the model of an existing GUI. The GUI is exercised by a combination of manual and automatic exploration, and information about its structure and some of its behaviour is automatically extracted, resulting in an incomplete GUI model. This model is subsequently completed manually, validated and used as input for automatic test generation and execution.",

These factors can compromise the integrity and performance of the technological services. In fact, they have consequences in the flow of the administrative processes with financial and pedagogic consequences for the Institution. Here, we present the development of a prototype for an integration solution of several university information systems based on a Web Services approach. We established the University of Azores (UAc) as our case study, which can be interesting because of the heterogeneous and decentralized nature of the institution organization. Following this technological approach, we intend to show the fitness of the development of software systems based on service-oriented architectures to our case study. We believe that implementing a Web Services solution, allows agility and security, increases speed and ability, can be an economic form of service delivery in the exchange of (critical) information among UAc internal entities (e.g. Academic and Social Services) and external bodies (e.g. local airline company, Social Security Government Services).",

Since the beginning of the current century, several studies have been conducted in the area of photogrametry using digital image correlation associated with block motion algorithms to estimate displacements in reinforced concrete (RC) beams during a load test. Using image processing techniques it is possible to measure the whole area of interest and not only a few points of the tests materials. In this paper, block-matching algorithms are used in order to compare the results from photogrametry techniques and the data obtained with linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) sensors during the load tests of RC beams, which are very common to find in civil engineering laboratories.",

However, this should be a process to be carried out in the most effective ways looking especially at time and costs. Having proposed frameworks as a point of departure to reflect on the ways they may or may not work in practice, a dialogical action research is proposed for this work involving a close interaction with consultant companies.

In order to achieve this, enterprises are growing awareness of the fact that evaluating the product's internal and external quality is not enough anymore. The user experience and the quality in-use of a product are equally important, if not more. This paper describes a framework for the measure and evaluation of the user experience based on the standard ISO/IEC 9126-4. The evaluation is based on four main aspects: effectiveness, productivity, safety and satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Over the years, air transport has increased gradually. This increase can cause difficulties in air traffic management, reducing its effectiveness. The use of intelligent agents in air traffic management seems to be a promising approach to overcome this difficulty. Thus this paper proposes the creation of a multi-agent system for autonomous air traffic management. Several concepts and proposals suggested by other authors about this topic are used in this implementation in an attempt to create a system based on the strengths of each work. This work is also part of a larger project, related to the coordination of intelligent agents in the execution of joint missions. The connection between the two systems is the management of the aircrafts that perform the missions. With this system, it is possible to manage the landings and departures of the aircrafts in an airport, manage the vehicles moving on the airport and even prevent collisions between aircrafts moving in the covered airspace.",

This information is generated dispersedly because the patient seeks medical care in many different places over his lifetime. Access to a comprehensive set of a patient's health information is a challenge. It revolves around the patient so any managing scheme must be patient-centric. We took a pragmatic approach to this problem and developed a software standalone platform for secure personal health information storage, namely complementary diagnostic tests, on a portable device for mobility. Simplicity and ease of use were main objectives. A special attention was given to the security aspects associated with storing this kind of information.",

The main goal of this research project is the development of an ontology capable of standardizing the concepts related to a soccer game. Using Protégé (as development tool) and OWL (as language), low- and high-level concepts were created and validated by 60 soccer experts. From the 40 tested concepts, 33 were completely validated, which constitutes excellent indicators about their understanding and correction. In the future, the ontology developed in this project will be used as a base for a real-time analysis system capable of executing soccer player behavior analysis.",

This paper presents the development of an ontology that formalizes description of learning resources according to the IEEE Standard for Learning Object Metadata. This ontology adds the conceptual structure of learning object metadata and implements existing relations among them, in order to emphasize their pedagogical meaning. This paper describes learning resources with formal semantics procesable by machines and it offers a solution according to the challenge of sharing information independently generated in distributed way by dynamic sources. The developed ontology optimizes learning processes because it helps students, professors, designers of learning material, and automatic processes of software in their searching, acquiring, and using of learning material. This ontology establishes mechanisms and processes tending to solve differences arisen by the administration of information with multicultural origin and the advent of complex environments with incompatible semantics.",

The design of the proposed technique aims to result in a short and simple to extract shape description. We conducted several experiments for both retrieval and recognition tasks and the results obtained demonstrate usefulness and competiveness against existing descriptors. For the retrieval experiment the achieved bull's eye performance is about 60%. Recognition was tested with three different classifiers: decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM). Estimated mean accuracies range from 69% to 86% (using 10-fold cross validation). The SVM classifier presents the best performance, followed by the simple kNN classifier.",

    "abstract": "The developers of social network services, due to pressure related with short development cycles, costs and usability, often disregard its security and privacy. Thus, they need documental support that provides a quick search concerning the best development habits of these two components. This article shows an updated analysis of security and privacy within these services and presents solutions for specific situations. In order to do that, we made a literature revision, complemented later with field work, being the result the identification of problems and security and privacy mechanisms, as well as their most common functionalities. Our field work consisted of an exploration of 18 social network services, based on a form developed to standardize the tests that were planned (n consegui melhor tradução. Espero que a ideia seja a mesma). Lastly, we analyzed the security and privacy mechanisms' identified functionalities in terms of quantity and quality. We also described the best practices related to security and privacy, for the development of functionalities that are safer and respect the final users' privacy. We found out that nowadays, privacy of information and contents of the profile and of the search results is constantly violated; that the best practices regarding the definition of the password are not demanded and that the information that is available in these services is often insufficient and dubious.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks at sea provides on-site, distributed sensing of specific events. They can be complementary to existing satellite and airborne radar monitoring, providing continuous and real-time data feed. Of particular interest is chemical spill, such as oil slick. As unexpected occurrences, it is not possible to predict the location, size or weather conditions affecting the region. We present a simulation framework for a large-scale sensor network deployment at sea. Our main objective is to develop communication algorithms for localized maritime monitoring using realistic channel and weather models. The design choices are based on the application scenario description, through a bottom-up approach. Wireless channel and physical layer are fundamental for trustworthiness of results, thus particular focus is given to their model selection. The network architecture is based on a cluster protocol with application-specific decisions. The aim is to provide the best compromise between energy consumption, message delivery and network connectivity under dynamic environments.",

In this context, we propose and describe an innovative optimization methodology and a supporting software framework: i-om. The design goals of the proposed framework were twofold. The first comprises the decoupling, as much as possible, of the optimization process from the application specific processing tasks. In order to attain this goal, we opted to make use of intelligent techniques (i.e. metaheuristics). The second goal is to allow remote operation, and consequently great portability and interoperability, between the optimization tools and the visualization application. To fulfill the latter requirement the proposed framework was designed with the ability to communicate with external application using a specifically developed high level message protocol. The optimization framework was implemented and the paper presents illustrative results demonstrating the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

By resorting to remote monitoring systems, the need for clinical staff to physically move next to each patient to supervise their clinical condition is reduced. This paper focuses on the key issues and challenges faced in the design and implementation of a distributed remote patient monitoring system using the Internet as communication platform, while describing some of the technologies that can be employed for this purpose. To optimize the systems' usability by medical care professionals, intuitive interfaces were developed using Web technologies, with an Internet browser as the only tool required to access the system. The study demonstrated that data updating based on database pooling system (periodic queries) is not the optimal solution, as the resulting system is not scalable. Also, monitoring several patients simultaneously (on the same browser) requires considerable processing at the client machine, particularly in the case of ECG signals.",

In this work we evaluated the importance of a set of parameters in the classification of lung CT images, such as the size of the ROIs, the quantization level, and textural features used in classification. A support vector machine was used as classifier. The performance of the designed classifier was evaluated using a 10-fold cross validation method and the results compared based on overall accuracy, sensibility and specificity. This study shows that textural features have a good discriminatory power in the classification of lung emphysema in CT images.",

    "abstract": "The process of resources systems selection takes an important part in Distributed/Agile/Virtual Enterprises (D/A/V Es) integration. However, the resources systems selection is still a difficult matter to solve in a D/A/VE, as it is pointed out in this paper. Globally, we can say that the selection problem has been equated from different aspects, originating different kinds of models/algorithms to solve it. In order to assist the development of a web prototype tool (broker tool), intelligent and flexible, that integrates all the selection model activities and tools, and with the capacity to adequate to each D/A/V E project or instance (this is the major goal of our final project), we intend in this paper to show: a formulation of a kind of resources selection problem and the limitations of the algorithms proposed to solve it. We formulate a particular case of the problem as an integer programming, which is solved using simplex and branch and bound algorithms, and identify their performance limitations (in terms of processing time) based on simulation results. These limitations depend on the number of processing tasks and on the number of pre-selected resources per processing tasks, defining the domain of applicability of the algorithms for the problem studied. The limitations detected open the necessity of the application of other kind of algorithms (approximate solution algorithms) outside the domain of applicability founded for the algorithms simulated. However, for a broker tool it is very important the knowledge of algorithms limitations, in order to, based on problem features, develop and select the most suitable algorithm that guarantees a good performance.",

This article presents a model for IT Governance which is applicable to the banking sector, which begins with the identification of COBIT processes that support the fulfilment of the principles of operative risk defined by BASEL II. It also integrates best practices oriented to risk and investment management for IT, information security and service lifecycle administration, described in models like: RISK IT, VAL IT, ISO 27002 and ITIL respectively. This model allows a banking organization to govern, evaluate and monitor its IT, thus fitting it to its strategic objectives.

They are usually protected by the use of password-based authentication mechanisms, which is a weak link on conventional cryptographic systems, as the passwords can be easily copied or stolen. The usage of a biometric approach for releasing the keys is an alternative to the password-based mechanisms. But just like passwords, we need mechanisms to keep the biometrical signal safe. One approach for such mechanism is to use biometrical key cryptography. The cryptographic systems based on the use of biometric characteristics as keys are called biometrical cryptographic systems. This article presents the implementation of Fuzzy Vault, a biometrical cryptographic system written in Java, along with its performance evaluation.

For our study, we developed a method for assessing web accessibility techniques focusing on user experience.

Within these conditions programmers need development tools and techniques with an extreme level of productivity. We consider the code reuse as the most prominent approach to solve that problem. Our proposal uses the advantages provided by the Aspect-Oriented Programming in order to build a reusable framework capable to turn both programmer and application oblivious as far as data persistence is concerned, thus avoiding the need to write any line of code about that concern. Besides the benefits to productivity, the software quality increases. This paper describes the actual state of the art, identifying the main challenge to build a complete and reusable framework for Orthogonal Persistence in concurrent environments with support for transactions. The present work also includes a successfully developed prototype of that framework, capable of freeing the programmer of implementing any read or write data operations. This prototype is supported by an object oriented database and, in the future, will also use a relational database and have support for transactions.",

In this laboratory students will have the opportunity to develop skills in the “know-how-to-do” area, enabling them to conduct a series of practical experiences in “try-out” philosophy that will substantiate and consolidate all knowledge that the students acquired in lectures. It is quite possible that these resources aren't available in all universities and institutions, specifically in the university where the student is. This environment provides substance to the Directive stated in the declarations of Bologna and Prague that expresses “the teaching process is therefore student-centered”, strengthening the final pedagogical aim of “learning to learn”, as lifelong learning is assumed as an indispensable stage. What we propose is the creation of a virtual environment for e-learning where a series of virtual labs in many areas of electronics, automation and robotics are available, in this environment it will do possible for any student of any of these universities to scheduling of experience in any institution that belongs to this cloud, and thus can perform is work for anytime that will be available and with technical resources available or not available in its own university.",

It also describes conducted work in the design of a multi-agent platform for coordination of intelligent assistive technologies. Instead of using traditional robot odometry estimation methods, we have tested an independent indoor localization system for real-time localization. We conducted an experiment in two steps: first, creating and testing interaction interfaces with and between robotic systems, and secondly, wrapping all in a multi-agent system, defining a vacuuming-cleaning ontology. With the pose data from an indoor localization system, is it possible to compare with real robot positions. From this, we can make some platform assumptions regarding heterogeneous robot cooperation, by thinking further i.e. sharing workspace with humans.",

The latter is much more sensitive than other similar devices integrated in mobile phones and much cheaper than industrial accelerometers. Besides its stand-alone use, the system can be connected to a generic remote monitoring system.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade higher education has undergone significant changes marked by the Lisbon strategy of the European Union's Bologna process. Practices such as blended and e-Learning have been introduced as well as continuous initiatives and programmes. Given these changes higher learning institutions must try to adapt to their students' digital culture, which is conducive to new needs. This factor may indicate that new strategies and methodologies must be addressed and implemented in the classroom context, which must be adjusted to a new learning. The use of casting technologies has been found to be increasingly used associated with their apparent potential impact. Changes and innovations regarding the content of various subjects as well as respective activities are on the horizon. This need for change stems from the new technological environments/contexts within which the students are included. This work arises within the scope of the proposed creation of a research plan in Doctoral Programme in Multimedia in Education. The aim of this project is to assess the integration of podcasts, vodcasts, screencasts and emerging casting technologies in higher education learning environments and to assess both students' and teachers' opinions, practices and expectations. In this study we propose to create and integrate multimedia teaching contents, not only to support activities carried out in new learning environments whether face-to-face or distance learning, but also as a methodological strategy to adopt. The methodological choices will be mentioned throughout the article in conformity with the aim under study.",

The presented system uses a microcontroller with a standard Ethernet interface, to validate users presenting a compatible Ibutton or RFID Card. The user credentials are validated locally or in a central database. Authorized users are given access to reserved areas. By using a powerful database, very flexible and complex high level administration and management functions can be implemented. By sharing the local IP network infrastructure, maximum commonality and flexibility are achieved. Both microcontroller and database server software are fully implemented using Open Source developing tools.",

    "abstract": "The pace of business change has long been perceived as accelerating continuously, and even as having become unsustainable. Informatics is by turn a driver, an enabler, and sometimes a constraint of change. Informatics professionals need to be equipped to govern and lead not just IS/IT change but wider business change. In 2009 BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT in the UK, formed a Business Change Specialist Group, bringing together informatics and change management researchers and professionals. BCS has also commissioned research into the role of informatics professionals in initiating, prioritizing and leading business change. Businesses typically lack structures to manage change holistically across the enterprise. Informatics professionals tend to have a broad view across the organization, giving then a more holistic perspective on change than many of their colleagues. They have a wider role to play, centre-stage, not only in initiating and leading informatics change, but in integrating multiple concurrent change initiatives.",

However, competency-based approach for Human Resources (HR) management in organizations has finally changed this approach pushing more interest in non technical skills, the so-called soft skills. This paper presents an analysis of non technical skills required for a variety of IT (Information Technology) positions and areas based on data extracted from more than 3000 ICT job offers published in Spain during the last years. Requirements are also compared with those expressed as requirements for telco engineers and industrial engineers. We can conclude that soft skills profiles are different for each case and that these data should guide actions in education and career development areas.",

This paper explores some issues regarding data quality, including a taxonomy for data quality problems, gives emphasis to administrative databases and presents some of the existing quality problems in this data using real examples.

    "abstract": "It is now assumed that poor quality data is costing large amounts of money to corporations all over the world. Although research on methods and techniques for data quality assessment and improvement have begun in the early nineties of the past century and being currently abundant and innovative, it is noted that the academic and professional communities virtually have no dialogue, which turns out to be harmful to both of them. The challenge of promoting the relevance in information systems research, without compromising the necessary rigor, is still present in the various disciplines of information systems scientific area, including the data quality one. In this paper we present “data as a corporate asset” as a business philosophy, and a framework for the concepts related to that philosophy, derived from the academic and professional literature. According to this framework, we present, analyze and discuss a single explanatory case study, developed in a fixed and mobile telecommunications company, operating in one of the European Union Countries. The results show that, in the absence of data stewardship roles, data quality problems become more of an \"IT problem\" than typically is considered in the literature, owing to Requirements Analysis Teams of the IS Development Units, to become a “quality negotiator” between the various stakeholders. Other findings are their bottom-up approach to data quality management, their biggest focus on motivating employees through innovative forms of communication, which appears to be a critical success factor (CSF) for data quality management, as well as the importance of a data quality champion leadership.",

Despite this, most games still fail to provide true adaptability in their AI, resulting in situations where an intermediate level player is able to predict the AI's behavior in a short amount of time, leading to a predictable and boring game experience. Creating a truly adaptive AI would greatly benefit a videogame's intrinsic value by providing a more immersive and unpredictable game experience. This paper describes the development of an AI system for the First-Person Shooter (FPS) videogame genre that avoids this problem through the creation of adaptable rule-based behaviors, enabling AI characters to learn the best strategy for any given situation..",

    "abstract": "The fall of chess as a main domain for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, after the victory of Deep Blue over Kasparov, put forward robotic soccer as a new challenging domain for AI researchers. Robotic Soccer is very appropriate for researching in Distributed AI problems, e.g. coordination methodologies, whose results can later be applied to other domains. Coordination can be defined as the capability of several agents to work together as a team, in order to accomplish a common goal. In the context of robotic soccer, several aspects may benefit from appropriate coordination methodologies, since team play is decisive for winning the games. This paper presents a methodology to enable a team of robotic soccer agents to coordinate their positioning in the field, and a methodology that enables them to cooperatively execute predefined set plays (flexible plans). Both coordination methods are used in real soccer and sports in general, commonly known as formations and set plays respectively. However, its use in a team of autonomous agents is still unexplored and is a major innovation of this work. A graphical tool to define formations and set plays was fully developed in the context of this work offering a quicker and more appealing way to define both formations and set plays. The tool's interface was inspired on ”blackboard” applications, used nowadays for the same purpose in real sports. The tool enables very easy definition of set plays that may then be executed in real-time during the matches. Examples of complete set plays and their practical execution are also described, showing the usefulness of the set play concept and the utility of the developed tool.",

To accomplish this, the authors have created a fully pheromone-based agent and inserted it in CyberRescue's competition, evaluating its behavior by the contest's rules. This approach yields excellent results in open maps, even when wall placement is complex. On the other hand, the agent's behavior is unstable and limited when it has to cross narrow corridors to explore new areas and find the goal. In the competition's context, it proves itself as being an excellent exploratory strategy with a very low collision rate, while allowing the agents to successfully complete a considerable amount of maps. This article gives an overview of the design and implementation processes, while evaluating each characteristic's benefits and shortcomings.",

    "abstract": "Traffic control through semaphores, the so-called traffic lights, is an important asset at hand for engineers and practitioners in charge of managing large-scale urban networks. Optimization of traffic flow through city arteries depends highly on the way traffic lights are coordinated, and making them sort of intelligent in some way seems to be an excellent natural ground for the application of the autonomous agents metaphor. This paper reports on our preliminary work using reactive agents to test such an approach. Our main contribution relies on integrating an agent-based API layer to enhance an open-source simulator (SUMO, in this paper) to support a MAS-based traffic control platform to devise and test intelligent control in urban network scenarios. Some results are presented and discussed, as well as are some future work suggested.",

The technology herein presented intends to be able to automatically extract conference's relevant information - conference name, important dates, location, conference sites and topics - from emails and conveniently present it on a web interface. Differently from other tools, to the best of our knowledge no other application is able to do this sort of information extraction automatically. This paper reports on the first approach of the project and presents the results so far.",
