    "abstract": "Health has always been and always will be the mainstay of modern societies. From this axiomatic truth, the primary objective of this dissertation is focused on the analysis and specification of an information system that would allow better monitoring of the mentally ill. The approach to health in Portugal is still done in a stray without the necessary interaction of various health professionals on what is of paramount importance in health: the best interests of the patient. Given that, in contemporary societies, mental health has become all the more complex and troubling, with increasing prevalence. It is in our view essential to concentrate in creating sustainable alternatives, allowing not only the survival of the NHS, as well as the improvement of access to medicines and health services.",

    "abstract": "Most patients receive care from many health care providers, and consequently their health data is dispersed over many institutions' paper and EHR-based record systems. This reality leads to a fragmented system of storing and retrieving essential patient data that impedes optimal care leading to the coexistence of somewhat autistic systems. Providing means for scattered clinical information to be congregated where and when needed may have a strong impact on healthcare quality. Interoperability is a major requisite for effectively sharing information between systems. Standards like openEHR play an important role on achieving interoperability. Agents are software entities, which can embody different perspectives of the surrounding environment and act accordingly. They can perceive the dynamic character of the environment and update their knowledge, enabling pro-activeness regarding actions that are better suited according to a particular user and a given set of goals. In this work we extend our previous work of building a VEPR for inter-institutional data integration with the inclusion of openEHR usage for querying and storing data in order to pursuit the efforts towards Health Information Systems semantic interoperability.",

This fact, associated with the lack of software for the teaching of sound perception, generated the Music-AR, software that uses Augmented Reality technology for the teaching of sound properties, such as timbre, pitch and sound intensity, based on the Murray Schafer study, a major Canadian music educator. There were two small applications for that: the first one allows the child to manipulate virtual objects linked to sounds, this way, the child can loosen and stretch virtual objects relating them to the (bass and treble) sound pitch; the second focus on the concept of sound intensity, associating it to virtual animals been far or near to the children. Tests were applied and the results are presented in this work.",

A thorough knowledge of the candidates and their preferences in terms of courses and major competitors' institutions is essential to the strategic planning of higher education institutions both in terms of promotion and in the level of training offered. In this regard, the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra decided to develop a tool to analyze data from the National Competition for Access to Higher Education, the SBIAES — Business Intelligence System for analysis of Access to Higher Education, consists of a Data Warehouse and a client application in Microsoft Excel, using the PowerPivot and Power View technologies. This system allows to the decision makers of the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra to analyze quickly and intuitively the leading indicators, such as rational and non-rational preferences.",

    "abstract": "Mathematics is intrinsic to engineering and as such plays an integral role in the education of engineers. New challenges are being faced in higher education particularly in the areas of student motivation, engagement and attainment. As a result mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. Traditional methods of delivery such as lectures and tutorials need to evolve to counter these challenges with new pedagogical approaches explored including the use of new technologies. Today's students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. This paper describes a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology to develop and explore the use of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that integrates a web-based platform for the study of mathematics as part of an active learning constructivist setting. Students will utilise graphics tablets to create online content consisting of solutions to mathematical problems which will then be used by other students to reinforce core concepts. The platform will provide active support to engineering students especially those in their first year of study and mature students returning to education. It is expected that early use of the platform will help identify areas of weakness and provide the self-learning environment required for students to become more proficient in those areas. By challenging the student to demonstrate an active engagement in their learning and by encouraging the meaningful use of technology in the classroom, an improvement in the quality of learning that students experience should be realised.",

In Spain, the incidence of this disease in the region of Castilla y León reaches maximum values, with a high rate in the province of León, which implies an annual excess generation data (epidemiological and others), highlighting the need for a management system that allows them access, entry, modification and distribution, with the ultimate goal of creating a system for predicting and intelligent analysis of this disease. Further, genomic sequencing data of registered individuals will be imported, so there is the possibility of developing a future line of research which has the aim to clarify and determine all genetic variants that increase the risk of CRC.",

It is based on the integration of new miniaturized solid-state radiation sensors: a CdZnTe detector for gamma radiation and a high efficiency neutron detector based on novel silicon technologies. The sensing unit will include a wireless communication interface to send the data remotely to a monitoring base station as well as a GPS system to calculate the position of the tag. The system will also incorporate middleware and high-level software to provide web-service interfaces for the exchange of information and an expert system to continuously analyse the information from the radiation sensor and correlate it with historical data in order to generate an alarm when an abnormal situation is detected. REWARD will be useful for many different scenarios such as nuclear terrorism threats, lost radioactive sources, radioactive contamination or nuclear accidents. It can be deployed in emergency units and in general in any type of mobile or static equipment, but also inside public/private buildings or infrastructures. The sensing units will be highly portable thanks to their low size and low energy consumption. The complete system will be scalable in terms of complexity and cost and will offer very high precision on both the measurement and the location of the radiation. REWARD's goals will be realized by the collaborative effort of eight highly specialized partners, though synergistic research organizations, wireless sensor networks providers, software developers and application users. The modularity and flexibility of the system will allow for a realistic introduction to the market. Authorities may start with a basic, low cost system and increase the complexity based on their evolving needs and budget constraints.",

    "abstract": "Software development organizations focus their efforts and invest resources on improving their processes and motivating their teams. The goal of this initiative is to develop high quality software products; however, some difficulties related to the learning process can be found in the dynamics interactions of the professional teams within the organization. A potential cause for these difficulties can be attributed to the use and implementation of teaching methodologies with lower levels of team member motivation. Gamification offers a possible solution for these deficiencies providing more thought-provoking environments for the learning experience. In this paper we propose a teaching instrument based on the principles of gamification to achieve a required level of motivation in teams involved in process improvement. Thus, motivation makes possible a successful implementation of the continuous improvement cycle in software development organizations.",

The study included the intake of Spirulina platensis as an enhancement of physical exercise. The study was a double blind randomized trial, conducted in 2 months. The sample consisted of 20 female and 15 male older adults, divided into three groups: G1 (n = 12, 71.2 ± 7.5 years) performed traditional physical activities, such as weight lifting and dance; G2 (n = 13, 69 ± 5.8 years) did interactive activities using the Xbox Kinect (with the ‘Body and Brain Connection’ game) and made use of Spirulina platensis; and G3 (n = 10, 70.7 ± 4.8 years) undertook the same interactive activities and used a placebo. The results show that both traditional and interactive physical activities improve three parameters of functional capacity, namely aerobic endurance, agility, and balance (p ≤ 0.05). However, we found dissimilar effects in two parameters of functional capacity: there were no gains in flexibility in the three groups and there were only gains in terms of speed in G1 and G2. The intake of Spirulina platensis in G2 might be boosting the aerobic speed. The overall findings suggest that traditional activities and interactive physical activities are equivalent in improving functional capacity.",

Currently we can find different educational management systems, but are based on the management of qualifications, support, discussions, or work assignments. The application of game mechanics in some of them there, but is very limited, allowing the inclusion of a point system or awarding medals for achievements. The system described in this paper uses a standard educational management as Schoology tool to incorporate techniques of play called gamification, which allows to unify all the student tasks in a web/app. This form creates a more attractive and motivating system whereby you can create missions, view maps of missions, alert of points earned and even create portfolios of completed works. In conclusion, our proposal uses Schoology as a system of educational management plus gamification, which could be defined as a G-LMS (Learning Management System Gamified).",

In this research, they were used with the objective of making the students design and produce Digital Educational Resources (DER), in this case vodcasts. These vodcasts covered all the curriculum content of the discipline of Geology, 12thGrade, in order to promote learning and to verify their effects on educational outcomes. To achieve these objectives we have developed, over a school year, teaching and active learning strategies, where students were asked to search, select and critically evaluate information to produce vodcasts and reflect on these processes. The vodcasts were produced taking into account some of the principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the cognitive load theory for the production of multimedia messages. Students joined with enthusiasm and commitment to this methodology and have made a very positive review, stating that this allowed them to acquire scientific and technical knowledge, develop digital and communication skills, and work in teams, in a learning environment that provided them with a high degree of freedom, personal satisfaction and autonomy. The vodcasts were inserted into a rich technological classroom environment, such as the use of Moodle and the production of ePortfolios. The results of the formal tests in this discipline were quite good (mean = 14.7 points, in a 20 points scale). When compared to the results of students in previous years, with the same teacher, who kept constant the use of Moodle and of the ePortfolio, we noticed that there was an improvement. In 2012, students that used the Blog and the ePortfolio had an average of 14.1 in formal tests and in 2011, only using ePortfolios, had an average of 13.2.",

    "abstract": "Online teaching courses are becoming an appealing alternative to traditional in-class learning methods, therefore driving practitioners to explore new strategies for delivering contents to an overwhelming number of students. Nevertheless, migrating face-to-face learning methodologies to an online teaching environment is certainly challenging. More specifically, collaborative work, which provides valuable learning outcomes in classroom-based environments, is apparently unable to meet the online paradigm due to its intrinsic specificities: widely heterogeneous profiles, considerably large numbers of subscribers, scarcely balanced and doubtfully relevant feedback concerning students' progress, and poorly conducted personal attention facilities. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Sagittarius, a novel Open Educational Resource that uses data mining techniques to overcome such limitations. This open-source software enables building reliable and effective working groups in order to boost the learning experience of online courses by means of collaborative work. Collected observations on the Computer Engineering field show the feasibility of our approach and encourage practitioners to focus their efforts on this direction.",

However not just mobile devices have evolved. And others electronic devices we use every day also experienced changes that have become smarter as the example of home devices. All these devices interconnected in the same environment or the same network, making use of services and exchange information with other devices, characterize a smart environment. smarthomes are special class of such environments and, increasingly, has become a scene with a variety of heterogeneous devices. However, due to the rapid progress of technology and the rise of a large number of heterogeneous devices, a variety of independent communication protocols were created, establishing a complex scenario to ensure interoperability between them. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the state of the art with an emphasis on the interoperability of current Mobile Devices with other digital devices present in a smarthome. Thus, it will be defined which protocols are currently most commonly used for this purpose, what are the current ongoing projects, what are the limitations of the solutions found in the research and, finally, it will be proposed an alternative solution for interoperability between the devices at a smarthome.",

The goal of traceability is to improve the quality of products and services. The information that provides the traceability can be used to support the analysis of the implications and integration of change requests in different phases of innovative models and to understand the evolution of artifacts that represent the knowledge. This work presents a model that facilitates following the contributions of stakeholders that participate in co-creation of a service for video transmission in a telecommunications organization in Medellin, Colombia.

    "abstract": "After a massive adoption by domestic users, instant messaging (IM) wins a significant dimension in business domain. Its adoption in organizations, as a tool in the daily work, leads to a set of changes for all the employees. Their use generates relevant positive impacts, by establishing a more dynamic communication within the organization, but also with clients, partners and suppliers, which results in increased efficiency and productivity. Nevertheless, when mostly used for social chats, rather than professional purposes, or when there are frequent interruptions to their use, the impacts became negative. In order to reveal the perception of the user on using IM, and to evaluate its impact on the human factor, we have outlined this study, which was conducted in a multinational consulting corporation - information technology. It is therefore a case study with a quantitative approach, which was attended by 117 employees. The data was collected from 1-20 July 2013 through a survey. The results show a massive adoption of IM and a tendency to be used by employees who are not displaced, evidencing frequent use on a professional basis. The impacts of the IM adoption are consistent with the policy of human resource management department of the company.",

    "abstract": "Exogenous floating marine debris (EFMD) presents a worldwide concern, and, due to its ubiquitous characteristics and long-term threat within oceanic environments, is going under pressing scientific scrutiny. Search and detection of EFMD using remote sensing are very challenging and are looking for new break-through scientific approaches. Besides, the significant costs associated with these techniques implemented up to now make its worldwide spread prohibitive. The main focus of this Doctorate Thesis in Information Management is to create an automatic detection method for EFMD using distinct remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing techniques for EFMD have important applications to readily monitor illegal dumping and natural disaster outputs, and to improve rescues at sea. Moreover, marine management improvement can be easily attained not only from more efficient cost-effective EFMD detection and collection, but also from better understand the quantitative links between EFMD and marine systems health. Remote sensing technological development is other possible achievement associated with this type of research, principally vising ESA new satellites scheduled to be release in a near future.",

This article identifies some of the main optimization techniques, and is based on the action research method to provide evidence that the positive evolution of some indicators, namely, the number of visits, internet traffic and better web site placement in SERP (Search Engine Results Page) resulted, in part, from the application of these optimization techniques to a vehicle auction website in Portugal.",

Within this context, the paradigm of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is becoming popular due to recent initiatives based on OpenFlow. This article presents an analysis of security policy rules applied in an environment based on OpenFlow. The analysis of the security policy rules is realized based on data obtained from a simulation of a scenario, modeled using Colored Petri Nets (CPN), and validated by the state space generated from the outputs of this model. The collected results are for a specific scenario. However, the approach is useful to analyze several types of systems. Thus, this research demonstrates that is feasible to employ CPN to model and validate security rules in an OpenFlow-based SDN.",

In the case of remote interaction with unmanned vehicles (UAV) as cars, helicopters, airplanes, many researchers have resorted to the use of different types of hardware, including gloves, remote controls or video cameras are counted, however remote interaction suggests still a challenge. That's why in this paper the development of a natural user interface (NUI) for remote control of a RC (radio control) unmanned helicopter (UAV or drone) using the Kinect sensor, we propose and through a series of action commands defined by the natural movements of a person. To develop the system, initially proceeded with the conceptual design of the remote control, as well as the selection of sensors that allow the interaction of a person with a UAV. Then the action commands for control were specified to finally conduct a series of performance tests focused on evaluating the performance of the system against the commands executed by a user to control the selected UAV. The results showed a very efficient generic interface to control remote UAV, thereby generating a valuable alternative in the control of any type of unmanned vehicle through the use of the natural movements of a person.",

    "abstract": "Currently, software tends to assume increasingly critical roles in our society so assuring its quality becomes ever more crucial. There are several tools and processes of software testing to help increase quality in virtually any type of software. One example is the so called Model-Based Testing (MBT) tools, that generate test cases from models. However, most of these tools have a configuration phase, where test input data is provided manually by the tester, which influences the quality of the test suite generated. By adding coverage analysis to MBT tools it is possible to give feedback and help the tester to define the configuration data needed to achieve the most valuable test suite as possible. This paper presents a tool, PARADIGM-COV, that produces coverage information both over the PARADIGM model elements (to assess if input data is adequate to cover the test goals and assess if preconditions are achievable), and during test case execution (to identify the parts of the model/code that were actually exercised).",

In this work is introduced a set of guidelines to transform BPMN diagrams into Timed Automata (TA) networks (TA-networks) in order to make possible that business analysts and designers can perform evaluation (i.e., qualitative analysis) of BPs, based on the formal specification of BP-task model with TA. The application of the approach is aimed to evaluate the behavior of the BP-task model with respect to business performance indicators (for instance, service time, waiting time or queue size) derived from business needs.

An increasing interest is growing regarding embedded computers since they offer advantages related to portability, dedicated tasks, invisibility, amongst others. However, a plenty of hardware platforms are in the market, so it is complicated to determine which the best for a particular need. Benchmarks make those tasks easier by performing measurements in hardware by running applications and performing comparisons. Nevertheless, they are thought to meet some quite particular kinds of applications. Moreover, if some benchmark applications have to be merged, i.e. voice or images processing, there are not schemes to correctly measure hardware platforms. On the other hand, requirements such as reliability and availability are not commonly assessed as a dependant set in hardware platforms. In this work, we propose a novel method to select hardware architectures for Human Centered Computing based on benchmarking, genetic algorithms, weighted sums and statistical distances in order to consider non-functional requirements.",

The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has often been the theoretical framework supporting the action accordingly and the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) the most used instrument in measuring their level of implementation. Thus, the present study aims to contribute to improving information systems and clinical decision support in the management of diabetes as a Chronic Disease. Also aimed to make the translation and validation of the ACIC 3.5 and assess what level CCM is applied. The ACIC was applied to 175 doctors and nurses in primary care, belonging to a group of health centers. We defined the level of significance of 5%. In terms of results, it is observed that the ACIC Version 3.5 achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.958, indicating a high reliability and a coefficient of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin of 0.918, demonstrating that our data show excellent suitability for factor analysis. The group of health centers studied only guarantees a basic support to people with diabetes. In terms of applicability of the results of the CCM used in the care provision of the diabetic person and the family, let predict a long journey to make in this area.",

Although many proprietary solutions have been proposed, the standard IEEE 802.15.4 is about to become the global standard for WSN, since utilizes energy-efficient schemes to access the channel, and to transmit information at low speeds. However, this standard does not have a strategy for information differentiation, in which packets from nodes with a higher priority need to be sent sooner than packets from other nodes. Consequently, this paper evaluates, by means of numerical simulations, the assumption of an information differentiation scheme, which consists in modifying the Contention Window (CW) in the slotted IEEE 802.15.4, considering that nodes with lower CW values have higher probabilities to access the channel than nodes with higher CW values. Partial results show that this information differentiation scheme increases the channel access probability, when two or three levels of CW are implemented within the network.",

At present, only a few small cities have implemented procedures for collecting garbage in an innovative way. Thus, it is urgent to implement measures that initiate sustainable behavior, with the active participation of citizens, ensuring the conservation of resources through the reduction and recovery of waste. This paper describes the iEcoSys system (Intelligent Ecologic System) developed by the authors. It is a technological tool that identifies the waste produced individually, using RFID tags embedded in rubbish bags - the iBags. When depositing waste, the recycling center identifies and weighs each bag and the collected data is sent to a server system using ZigBee communication standard. When the information reaches the server system, it is inserted into the database management system, making it possible to see the deposited waste in the iEcoSys Internet portal, and even order new iBags. Making the cities smarter and promote sustainability by changing the paradigm of receiving the recycled rubbish instead of paying for the waste produced, is the contribution of this study.",

At the same time, irregular rainfall, coupled with the occurrence of high temperatures, are strong obstacles to the preservation and growth of plants, causing high rates of water deficiency. Recently, several systems of soil monitoring and irrigation control have been developed with the aim of improving water use efficiency. This study describes a system (iRain), developed by the authors, which aims to ensure autonomous and efficient irrigation in urban gardens. It consists of a net of sensors and actuators with Zigbee communication and control software for storage and availability of monitoring data on a web portal in real time. In manual mode, the irrigation management is the responsibility of the irrigation manager in order to control the system from the portal. In automatic mode, the system prevents watering if there is a forecast of precipitation (up to 3 days) and if the humidity of the soil has not fallen below a critical value. In this mode the decision is made at the local base. The system also gives preference to irrigation at night and during periods of light wind in order to obtain more accurate and efficient irrigation. Thus, the iRain constitutes a valuable tool for promoting sustainable use of this scarce natural resource.",

By analyzing the existent literature on the SNS adoption at firm level, the authors perceived the existence of a knowledge gap on this topic, thus creating the need for a SNS related literature review. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on the SNS topic, mainly focusing the efforts towards the adoption of this technology at firm level. Some final considerations on future research are also presented in the final section of the article.",

This paper aims to identify models of frameworks for the prescription of AT that may serve as a foundation to develop comprehensive models for the selection, prescription and counselling process of ALL solutions. A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Eric and CiteSeerX databases using a predefined strategy. The relevant literature extracted was screened and a list of models and frameworks was elaborated. Seven models or frameworks were included for analyses. It was possible to find ICF components in all of the models or frameworks. The results showed a shift between the models from the end of last century, based in an instrumental description of components involved to a predictive end users behaviour concern. Future work should deepen the conceptual issues about the selection, prescription and counselling process of AAL systems and services.",

The motivation of developing Hipster is the lack of standard Java search libraries with an extensible, flexible, simple to use model. Moreover, most of the libraries for search algorithms rely on recursive implementations which do not offer fine-grained control over the algorithm. Hipster provides a wide variety of classical search algorithms implemented in an iterative way like Dijkstra, A∗, IDA∗, AD∗ and more. In order to facilitate the use and integration with most research, commercial and non-commercial projects, the software is developed under the open source Apache 2.0 License. Hipster was successfully applied in two different research projects in the areas of Web service composition and motion planning.

Recently researchers apply the multi-agent paradigm to such domain taking advantage of its research in cognition, deliberation, and mainly coordination mechanisms. The aim of our research is to contribute to the multiple quadcopter simulation area introducing a platform for the design, simulation, and development of quadcopter MultiAgent Systems (MAS). Specifically for this paper, we minutely discuss the proposed architecture and present the implemented prototype focusing our experiments on the scalability and the resource usage of it. The results demonstrate that the centralised perspective limits the scalability mainly when the physical engine is being used; also, we identify that the method responsible for the 3D update is the platform's bottleneck. After this work different type of studies in social interaction of quadcopters will follow up as well as the improvement of the proposed architecture, for instance, using a multi-threading approach.",

This article is within the scope of the characterization of the profile of this new students, intensive user of digital technologies in their various platforms (PCs, notebooks, tablets, smartphones, digital games). Theories have been proposed in order to conceptualize the profile of this \"new student\" as well as the set of skills and cognitive, motivational and emotional competencies arising therefrom. Among these, we highlight the concepts of \"digital natives\" and \"digital generation\", terms that refer to the generation of intensively socialized individuals from early childhood in the use of digital technologies. In recent years these types come under fire since the impact of digital technologies is mostly due to the type, usage context and motivation of different users, rather than to age and gender. The objective of this paper is to discuss the main criticisms of these typologies, from the notion of \"visitors\" and \"resident\" digital. Besides the theoretical discussion exploratory research with 127 adolescents from Rio de Janeiro, aged between 11 and 19 years, of both sexes, aimed at mapping the types, motivations and contexts of use of digital technologies in their daily lives was performed. A questionnaire as a method of data collection was used. The results obtained corroborated overcoming the initial concept of digital natives, indicating the variety and multiplicity of levels of engagement and use of digital technologies are crucial variables for this use factors such as availability, interest and mastery of these technologies and their respective platforms. This context requires the construction of new teaching technologies, compatible with the profile described.",

To achieve these goals six organizational decision makers were interviewed to allow the development and refining of an online survey. The results show that the Cloud Computing adoption factors are the scalability and cost savings, while the factors for the adoption of Cloud Computing based e-mail services are the costs reduction and improvements in supporting business processes.

Given the state of the art, we present a generic conceptual model that promotes the reuse of existent information, concepts, standards, solutions and specifications. This model is based on modular components and loosely coupled services, and the implementation of this concept is embodied by a Service Oriented Architecture.

    "abstract": "The polemic fusion of the Schools in mega-clusters has been the focus of many stakeholders in the process, interested mainly in understanding the underlying criteria to this merger. In Castelo Branco there were four groups taking the name of the school that became their headquarters: Afonso de Paiva, Faria de Vasconcelos, Cidade de Castelo Branco and João Roiz. Out of this process there were two secondary schools in the city: Nuno Alvares and Amato Lusitano. These schools were georeferenced in the city road network, previously scanned. The ArcGIS software and Network Analyst extension were used. They allowed addressing the issue of the formation of mega-clusters by analyzing the network, namely by solving coverage problems with time and distance criteria. Heuristically, a found solution consisted in grouping three schools belonging to the west axis of the city and in the creation of a second mega-group for the remaining three schools. This solution presents a balanced distribution of the school population, since the difference between these two mega-groups corresponds to about 2% of the total population.",

The desired knowledge concerns the transfer of people between organizational areas (internal turnover), in order to provide organizations a model for assessing the impact of these transfers on their people management policies. Therefore, this article describes a model that applies techniques of clustering and association rules for the discovery of knowledge on transfers of staff between units of a Brazilian financial organization. To allow the expression of this knowledge in a compact expressive way, a new dimension type is proposed for the multidimensional model. This way, the hypothesis is evaluated on a case study conducted in a Brazilian organization, with over four thousand units spread nationwide and over 95 thousand employees.",

The present work proposes a co-creation model through systemic archetypes that allow the capture of value elements, which arise from the service use experiences. The register of attributes through software is used after the client´s expression of the attributes using a constructive dialogue for which a qualitative focus is adopted in order to find a socially constructed meaning, having as research central axis the interpretative phenomenological analysis. The results show that the methodology allows the value capture through the evaluative speech acts which belong to the language philosophy.",

The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of best practices in ITSM and is now highly adopted by the industry. However, implementing ITIL is complex and costly, and enterprises that design, adopt and provide ITSM services, often end up with different analysis methods and designs for similar ITSM solutions. Aiming at reducing costs and standardizing ITIL-based implementations we propose a methodology to build ITIL conformant interfaces for its processes and functions. This methodology aims for the standardization and partial automation of the construction of reusable software components that are ITIL conformant. It promotes software reuse for ITSM /ITIL solutions market, through the future development of ITSM interfaces.",

It starts by theoretically contextualizing trust, and then situates trust in the field of computer science. Then, describes the proposed model, which builds on what one perceives to be trustworthy and is influenced by a number of factors such as the history of participation and user's perceptions. It ends by situating the proposed model as a key contribution for leveraging trustful interactions and ends by proposing it used to serve as a complement to foster user's trust needs in what concerns Human-computer Iteration or Computermediated Interactions.",

In multi-radio and multi-channel scenarios an effective frequency assignment must be done to radios so that higher throughput and low delay can be obtained and the best of such architectures is achieved. Here we propose an approach for frequency assignment in multi-radio and multi-channel FiWi access networks. A simulation model is built to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our scheme is able to increase throughput and reduce delay, when compared with a fixed assignment strategy, by carefully planning frequency assignments which makes it possible to increase network parallel transmissions (reduce time division).",

However, the fast evolution is instigating some issues in this area's accessibility. To understand the conceivable impact of these issues' tenacity in society, general accessibility features are explained as a reasonable application for all parties. Nevertheless, the potential of ubiquitous computation in order to promote social integration of citizens with impairments is focused and elucidated. The benefits of applying so much effort on accessibility as well as on usability is asserted and related to universal design. Hence, in order to promote a more universal applications development, the mobile operating systems available in the market, which are more plausible to be chosen and used by people with impairments, are scrutinized and shown from a standpoint of a developer that has accessibility and usability concerns. The paper leads to the conclusions that ubiquitous computation may have power to nullify impairments but, to be assistive, several issues regarding the devices and the operating system that runs on them have to be taken in mind and considered.",

Considering heuristics used in these problems, it is possible to identify two different approaches, those that use the execution time to allocate tasks and those that use the completion time.

This article presents the results obtained concerning the students' perception about: (i) the provision of CTSL by PPHE; (ii) the type of classes that use CTSL; (iii) the main purposes of using CTSL; (iv) the teachers' use of CTSL; and (v) the activities promoted through the use CTSL. The main results obtained allow us to conclude that the access to CTSL in the PPHE is free, and the CTSL are used in most classes. In terms of use purposes, the results suggest that most students use CTSL to access and gather information and / or content related to their learning activities. The relevance and main contribution of this study is to enable the identification and characterization of the current situation regarding the student´s use of CTSL in PPHE.",

Indeed, cooperative work adds value to the processes of teaching and learning, allowing the acquisition of the Key Skills with greater ease and effectiveness. One of the fundamental factors to implement these methodologies based on cooperative work is the definition and formation of heterogeneous working groups among students. However, this is not a trivial task: the large number of parameters to be taken into account to generate heterogeneous groups in a class is a key parameter that increases the complexity of the task. Currently, this process of group allocation is manually solved by the teaching staff; an individual profile analysis is performed for each student and then each one is assigned to a particular group, which can take more than a week of work when the number of students is around 120. This paper presents a tool that supports the teaching staff in this daunting task and that allows the automatic generation of heterogeneous groups. The tool, its functionalities, the technical processes for development and the decisions to validate its design and obtain satisfactory results are detailed.",

This task is considered as the first problem and it is very important for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. This research aims to analyze publicized stream of tweets from the Twitter microblogging site. The data stream are preprocessed and classified based on their emotional content as positive, negative and neutral. The data analysis is limited to a particular set of users. Firstly, we collect and process post comments on Twitter. Then the post was analyzed by lexical and syntactic approach. In experiment results, we detects more neutral emotional states than positive or negative (31%). We also applied statistical methods in order to infer if there exist correlation between user reputation and emotional content. The finding suggest that did not exist a strong correlation between user reputation and emotional content. From our observation, user reputation do not follow any emotional rules.",

This motivates the need for studying the reasons of such a situation, and for designing future CRM implementation methods that are better prepared for the task in hand. Rather than just thinking from anew, and pretending to design a completely new method from scratch, we believe that there already exist methods and tools, developed for other related areas, that may become good referents of practices that could be considered and integrated into a future CRM implementation method. In this paper we first describe succinctly the main issues surrounding CRM implementation projects, such as their typical critical success factors, organizational issues and nature of such projects. Then we present the set of selected practices that can be combined and integrated into a CRM implementation process. Thus, this paper presents a first approximation to what may be a future CRM implementation methodology that involves the aforementioned practices and supports the professionals involved in this kind of implementation project.",

Thus, the traditional information systems are undergoing a process of adaptation to this new computing environment. However, it is important to note that the characteristics of this new context are different. In it there are new features and consequently new possibilities as well as not existing before restrictions. Finally, the systems developed for this environment has different requirements and characteristics of the traditional information systems. For this reason, there is a need to reassess the current knowledge about the processes of planning and construction for the development of systems in this new environment. One area in particular that demand such adaptation is the estimation software. The estimation processes, in general, are based on characteristics of the systems, trying to quantify the complexity of implementing them. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to present an estimation model for mobile applications.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of recent developments of Information Technologies in Education (ITE), particularly in higher education, to answer students and teacher's needs, according to the real time rapidity characteristics of the process of learning and teaching. The internet, mobile computing, social networks and many other advances in human communications have become essential to promote and boost education, technology and industry [1]. In this sense, the learning and the teaching process have to take such developments into account. As a consequence the teaching profession is evolving from an emphasis on delivering information to an emphasis on creating learning environments [2]. Indeed, the new challenges related with the integration of ITE into all aspects of the learning process require revising the traditional educational paradigms that have been prevailed for last years. Thus, on the one hand, the theoretical framework of this paper is based on literature about information technologies, in general, and information technologies in higher education, in particular. On the other hand, the empirical framework reflects the best practices in this field used in the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda (IPG, Portugal). The results of the paper show that the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are facing new challenges, not only to promote an adequate education in each field of study to the students, but, also, to develop them with skills and knowledge required to leverage information technology effectively to the workplace on firms.",

This paper describes an experiment designed to elicit human behaviour when facing the urgent need of exiting a room of an unknown building. This test is part of a methodological approach that aims at the creation of a framework coined SPEED (Simulation of Pedestrians and Elicitation of their Emergent Dynamics). A population sample of 22 subjects was used to test such a methodological approach, which consists in having the subjects answering a questionnaire and later on, in playing a Serious Game. The game environment presents the same scenarios shown in the questionnaire using more elaborated 3D rendering to provide players with a sense of realism. The game was developed under the Unity3D game engine and based on the Serious Games concept. Preliminary results are promising, showing that the challenge made players think about the various situations that might happen when facing an emergency. They are also implied to reason on their stream of decisions, such as which direction to take considering the environment and some adverse situations, such as smoke, fire and people running on the opposite direction of the emergency signalling.",

First, we verified the existence of related project management techniques. Second, we mapped the results obtained by the project in order to verify whether the project management had impacted on the results, as expected. We conclude that the Lego robot is a motivational factor for the students and can be adopted as a learning object in the teaching of Software Project Management.",

This work's motivation was based primarily on two aspects: the PSL qualified interpreters are scarce, and the most common digital method to present sign language, namely the video with humans, it is a difficult medium to edit and reuse. After said that, it makes perfectly sense to use a deaf-signer virtual human capable of reproduce this language. With the advent of the Microsoft Kinect, the motion capture sessions turn out to be a easiest and more accessible process than the conventional systems. Our research involves this low-cost technology to support the animation of a virtual human. This paper describes an application within the education domain, which uses an avatar as a PSL virtual interpreter. The virtual signer objective is to teach basic concepts of PSL in a fun and easy manner, targeted especially to children. The tool allows the translation of Portuguese words to PSL, it allows to combine signs into simple sentences, and also illustrates several grammatical concepts such as: negative or interrogative sentence construction; gender and plural marking; and verbal time conjunction. It was included as well, a didactic component to test the user's knowledge, through a simple game of association between words and signs. The evaluation results shows that the application could contribute to the PSL education, and shows that avatars are useful in the sign language context.",

    "abstract": "The huge changes concerning the workplace that we are facing, as well the challenges placed by the Information Society and by the globalisation trends, demand new perspectives for education, continuous education and lifelong learning. New methods demand new organisation alternatives that, in turn, require new educational policies and put pressure in current assumptions of education itself. Distance Education is a challenge by itself. It places new demands both to the learner, but also to the facilitator. A set of seven dimensions for a distance learning environment were identified, which positively impacts the setting of learning experiences: (1) access tools; (2) technology experience; (3) habits and study skills; (4) human factors and life style; (5) goals and guidelines; (6) learning preferences; (7) personal characteristics [1]. This paper defends that the learners, when asked about their characteristics, taking into account different issues of their familiar, personal and professional life, available technology resources, technology skills, as well as motivation and learning preferences, provide an information set that, if turn available to facilitators, allow to both players (learners and facilitators) the mechanisms that ease the adoption of learning strategies, that enhance the possibility of a well succeed learning experience. To accomplish the research goals, an empiric study was conducted in the context of a Distance Education (DE) institution, taking a sample of 214 learners, with diverse characteristics. The data analysis allows the confirmation of the position validity and proves that it is possible to know in advance the distance learners more important characteristics and of the surrounding environment as means to access potential success and rate failure. Based on such knowledge it is possible to establish a classification of those characteristics, suggesting strategies and counseling to support decisions and thus to improve the distance learning success.",

Different studies evidence the potential impact of video games on learning, however very few empirical studies that focus on continuous assessment. On the other hand, because the variables that influence the achievement of learning objectives are different levels becomes complex to validation the effectiveness of an assessment of game-based learning, therefore, it is necessary to test inferences on academic development, testing hypotheses rigorous causal. We propose the use of multivariate analysis based on structural equation modeling as it facilitates the establishment of dependency relationships, to validate the proposal; we have performed an empirical test analytical applying a sequence of scenarios different to stimulate cognitive function of planning in a child population.",

Education with technological mediation invites us to practice and continuous training, contextualized assessment, flexible and interactive, stimulating dialogue between teachers and students. The evaluation process would be simplified if we sought more support technologies, little used in assessment practices. We present results of a survey conducted with 55 teachers / tutors of a course held in blended learning mode, with intense technological mediation, in Rio de Janeiro. In the questionnaire we asked the \"evaluation procedures used\" Was cited for a variety of important evaluative formative assessment strategies such as problem solving, games and concept maps, but received little mention. We consider positive the reference to portfolios, projects and forums. In the second category of research analysis chosen, \"experiences with the evaluation\" was nice to realize that references to positive experiences to overcome the negative review. In both cases the results appeared as a major factor. The positive references were frequent mentions of satisfaction with the work done and the observation of student progress. The negative aspects we quote the fact that the evaluation be arduous and repetitive process, as well as the complexity of the type of education with the mediation of digital technologies bring to the evaluation. We observed that the training teacher courses insufficiently address the evaluation of learning and the difficulties with the same can be minimized if it is shared with the students own their learning through clear and built together teaching contracts, in which both parties involved in the processes of teaching and learning be liable jointly, each with their skills.",

Another important factor was perception of change in skills acquired during the course, as it may also indicate an increase in self-confidence and motivation of the students to continue their studies. Specific issues such as: available material, interaction with colleagues, resources of the virtual environment and the presentation of content by teachers. All of them were also evaluated in two moments of the discipline and it showed satisfactory results for planning the course.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, most classrooms are equipped with technological resources and Internet connection, which enables access to an endless amount of tools that may contribute for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning. In spite of the availability of these technological resources, we seldom find pedagogical practices grounded upon institutional guidelines which make the best of these tools. This is partly due to the fact that leaderships don't always have a clear and objective perception, as well as a quantitative perspective supported by indicators, of the subject. This entails leaderships are not able to portray accurately and promptly the performance of these technological policies in schools. School leaderships should point directions that lead to the proficient use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) so as to pave way for a educational paradigm shift that reflects a new conception of teaching and learning. In this context, it is the aim of this investigation to identify the necessary information that should be collected as well as the proper models and instruments for data collection that support the decision-makers in adopting adequate measures to the educational contexts of each school community. Hopefully, this contribution will aid in the setting of new paths for the development of information systems applied in educational settings, indicating functional organics for the automatic, systematic and systemic collection of indicators that support the decision-making process as far as technological policies in educational contexts are concerned. Among these stages are the review and estimate of investments, training necessities, supervision practices, partnership needs and the change in suppliers. The present paper was elaborated as part of a Doctoral Degree program in Educational Leadership by the Portuguese institution Universidade Aberta Portuguesa, in the context of the project “Teaching Procedures, Technology and Innovation in Alternative Educational Measures”, integrated in the third dimension which comprises the problematic regarding the integration and use of technology in the educational intervention and learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A considerable number of domains deal with large and complex volumes of temporal data. The management of these volumes, from capture, storage, search, transfer, analysis and visualization, still provides interesting challenges. One critical task is the efficient retrieval of data (raw data or intermediate results from analytic tools). Previous work proposed the TravelLight method which reduced the turnaround time and improved interactive retrieval of data from large temporal datasets by exploring the temporal consistency of records in a database. In this work we propose improvements to the method by adopting a new paradigm focused in the management of time intervals instead of solely in data items. A major advantage of this paradigm shift is to enable the separation of the method implementation from any particular temporal data source, as it is autonomous and efficient in the management of retrieved data. Our work demonstrates that the overheads introduced by the new paradigm are smaller than prior overall overheads, further reducing the turnaround time. Reported results concern experiments with a temporally linear navigation across two datasets of one million items. With the obtained results it is possible to conclude that the improvements presented in this work further reduce turnaround time thus enhancing the response of interactive tasks over very large temporal datasets.",

These researches include some guidelines such us to include training to managers in social media and Online tools for reputational influence [3][4]. In the Spanish case, where large corporations are not the majority of the business, but are SMEs [5], an approach of this kind raises the question not only about CEOs but about the entire chain of command. The principle that all agents involved in a process of outreach contribute to this projection is applied [4]. This work in progress (short paper) focuses on the variation of the point of view when considering the different hierarchical levels of the chain of command. The study across 4 categories (CEO or Director, Senior manager, Middle management, technical staff) revealed homogeneous general trends but at the same time some specific differences which had to be taken into consideration. As a general conclusion, it was detected a need to strengthen the transmission policy of the strategy, at the several command levels, as discrepancies hinder the execution of the organization's plans.",

Para grande parte destes casos existe uma dificuldade acrescida, não só em encontrar o dono do animal, mas também em reunir os esforços de inúmeros voluntários que, de uma forma ou outra, pretendem ajudar. De forma facilitar a procura de animais perdidos, foi proposto disponibilizar uma aplicação móvel em iOS, que permite a um utilizador colocar anúncios sobre animais perdidos e/ou encontrados, com base na localização onde foram vistos pela última vez. A aplicação serve igualmente de apoio à busca do animal. Sendo este um serviço que foca principalmente o senso comum e o espírito de entreajuda, torna-se importante notificar o utilizador no seu dia a dia, em situações em que ele pode ser verdadeiramente útil sem prejudicar, por exemplo, o seu itinerário. Por isso, foi criado um sistema de alertas que avisa o utilizador, ao passar numa determinada rua, quais os anúncios atuais na sua proximidade.",

However, it is not feasible to analyze a significant number of documents in a short time without the support of a computational tool. The Information Extraction aims to extract from textual documents only the relevant information defined by the user. This information can be mapped and classified in the field of health through ontologies. This paper proposes the design of an information extracting mechanism that, in a hybrid form, can combine: an extractor for textual documents; the construction and use of a domain ontology for evidence-based nursing, aiming to assist in the classification of documents which will be extracted by the extractor and in the representation of this domain with respect to the computational area.",

This study evaluates the factors that influence students in their choice of a pair establishment-course as well as understand the different variables that are related to the same attribution of influence. The study is observational and empirical using questionnaires, with the appropriate statistical analysis. The results showed a relation in greater number among the studied factors and gender.

We propose a synchronization model based on message digests to synchronize relational databases between mobile devices and a server, in order to minimize the data transferred between the device and the server and to minimize the processing done by the mobile device. The approach consists in a synchronization model where the amount of data to be exchanged has been reduced to the minimum. In order to achieve the model above a registry is done in the device with the new, the modified or removed content, which purpose is to send only the essential data for synchronization from the device to the server. Regarding the synchronization from the server to the device, the modifications are calculated and sent to the device. This model is independent of proprietary solutions and can be adapted to any system or platform, often involving software development to the mobile application and the application server. The results of testing the model show that the proposed model can achieve better synchronization times than the competitor models, while always fulfilling the set objectives.",

In order to identify the variables the co-creation systemic archetype is used and it allows the value elements capture arising from clients' experiences in a case study of a telecommunications company that provides the 4G LTE service. Clients through the bipolar differential methodology make the valuation of value elements using software that allows the register and valuation. Clients express their opinions by the use of linguistic labels defined between two opposite adjectives as a result of a social dialogue. The valuations' results are obtained after the use of the fuzzy inference system, which brings as a result the belonging function of the co-created value variable. The results show that the methodology allows the capture and measure of value elements through illocutionary acts that are proper of the language philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Outsourcing is a world-wide contemporary practice that has involved to software industry. Different States have incorporated this practice as a way of optimizing their resources. Therefore, software acquisitions require public calls for software tenders. Unfortunately, in Latin-American countries and, specially in their local governments, there are software projects formulated under conditions which seriously affect the success of these projects. In this paper we use the metaphor of the “brave new world” in order to close an empirical approach to the “real world”. We present a set of rules to be applied in e-government projects. These rules have been compiled from a set of expert “survivors” in the software market in a developing country. The goal is twofold, firstly, to propose a quick guide of non-functional requirements for e-government projects and, secondly, to show how using a literary metaphor allows to justify an epistemological position to empower the experience value of their original actors.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia had only conducted two direct presidential elections in 2004 and 2009, respectively. Despite all the problems, it is understood that the country is trying hard to improve the quality of its elections, which includes using electronic voting (e-voting). However, the claim on how Indonesia is ready to implement e-voting in its presidential election is considered baseless, or at least is believed to be premature. There are many issues that need to be firstly addressed, such as infrastructure unreadiness, people's reluctance to accept the technology, and lacks of standard and framework prior to the implementation; before jumping into conclusion that the country needs the technology. This paper argues on the needs for a thorough study on e-voting and serves as a preliminary towards a standard and framework for implementing the technology in Indonesia. It looks at the problems lingering the country's previous elections and the issues with implementing e-voting in Indonesia. This paper suggests that such study should see through the perspective of development research. Finally, it proposes a framework that urges the application of participatory processes and promotes iterative development work.",

Therefore, this paper presents a method for the extraction of tacit knowledge applied in a government organization.

Ontologies are composed by concepts, a hierarchy, arbitrary relations between concepts, and possibly other axioms. However, ontology building is a time-consuming process, and it should be supported by automatic finding of interesting, possible relationships among concepts. This paper describes how an analysis of co-occurrences of concepts in unstructured sources of information can be used to provide interesting relationships for enriching ontological structures. We apply association rule theory to construct ontological concept relations and evaluate the importance of such relations for supporting the building process of a domain ontology. Preliminary results were collected using scientific published papers from the building and construction sector, which were used as an input for applying our method. A knowledge browsing environment was developed in order to support the analysis process.",

Taking this into consideration, this research focuses on setting a classification system of the envelopes opaque systems, crossing the knowledge and parameters of construction systems with requirements in terms of sustainability that they may have. To have a better understanding of how these systems work with respect to their sustainable contribution to the building. Therefore in this paper it evaluates the importance of the envelope design on the building sustainability, it analyses the parameters that make the construction systems behave differently in terms of sustainability. At the same time it explains the classification process generated from this analysis that results in a classification where all opaque vertical envelop construction systems enter.",

The Hypervideo platform consists of a backoffice to manage audiovisual content and hot-spots, and an interactive video player based in HbbTV technology. The player lets the user get additional information of the points of interest which are displayed over the images. This project presents a useful platform to audiovisual production teams, letting them mix, in an easy way, these three technological concepts: interactive video, augmented reality and connected television. This paper concludes with some improvement possibilities and extension to other devices.",

    "abstract": "Many digital production companies (whether for games, animated productions or digital cinema) now control and review their assets via web-based tools, due to the fast-moving ecosystem and rapid prototyping of web applications. The ability to access such tools via mobile interfaces is increasing in importance, particularly with the rise in power of mobile hardware. Yet, in the field of real-time 3D graphics, progress is hampered by both the lack of cross-platform software compatibility (particularly lack of mobile browser WebGL support), and by lower hardware performance for certain plaforms, especially mobile. In this paper, we analyze the barriers for developing cross-platform 3D graphics technology and, based on this analysis, present a suitable cross-platform pipeline that allows the viewing and editing of real-time 3D scenes in a collaborative environment. We compare a mobile implementation of this pipeline with a WebGL-based engine for desktop use, and present and discuss results on the differences between these two implementations. We further demonstrate a system for collaborative 3D scene creation using our pipeline with a custom plugin for the modeling software Autodesk Maya.",

In this context, response systems emerge as an innovative tool associated with diverse methodologies and strategies. Response systems are technological products designed to support communication and interactivity, generating an enormous potential when applied in the teaching-learning process. The use of response systems and their implications in the teaching-learning are some of the challenges faced by teachers as agents boosters in the implementation of this technology in school. The student motivation increases when this technology is used leading to greater participation and consequently to a better and faster acquisition of concepts. Collaborative and cooperative attitudes among student-student, student-teacher and student-class are incremented when using response systems in the context of the classroom. This paper presents the state of the art about the use of response systems in the teaching-learning process.",

The study formed part of a multi study investigation into the role played by ITIL in improving outsourcing outcomes. These “lead users” provided evidence of how, used effectively, ITIL can improve the outsourcing relationship. Informants suggested that the extent to which the client and vendor understand each others' expectations is crucial to using ITIL effectively, as are knowledge sharing and other aspects of good communication. This is also consistent with a further study of 83 ITIL users' experience. However, informants observed that it can take time before ITIL processes are fully understood and incorporated into practice. The paper concludes that where ITIL practices and principles are internalized into the day-to-day processes and behaviours of the firm (and its IT culture) the greatest benefits will be obtained.",

While equality comparison between two objects can be calculated by computers quickly and accurately similarity is a complex problem to calculate. Even still difficult to determine similarity plays a fundamental role in many applications such as decision-making systems, data mining and pattern recognition. The same applies to the spatial similarity in the processes of recovery and integration of spatial information. In this paper a methodology based on the semantic processing of geospatial information is proposed. It consists of five stages: conceptualization, synthesis, application processing, retrieval and management. It uses ontology of New Genetic Soil Classification of Cuba and applying the measure of semantic similarity Conceptual Distance (DIS-C) combined with an implementation model TDD (Topology-Direction-Distance) to restore and support the user in the selection of spatial scenes. As a case study is considered the town of San Jose de Las Lajas located in the province of Mayabeque in western Cuba.",

    "abstract": "eGovernment initiatives have been progressively influenced by an emphasis on open government. In this context, it is particularly relevant the online availability of data which would allow citizens to make public officials accountable for their actions (transparency for accountability). One important issue concerning online transparency assessment is to know which data should be made available in public sector entities web sites in order to facilitate the accountability process. In general, research literature selects such required data according to legal requirements and international standards (such as those from public sector accounting), thus not taking into consideration the requirements of ordinary citizens as ultimate recipients of accountability related information. To close this gap, and considering the role of journalists as information brokers, a qualitative content analysis was performed on news from three Portuguese newspapers published in a month period. The analysis resulted in the identification of a set of relevant information items for public debate concerning the actions of public officials, from a journalistic point of view. This set of items might be used not only as a baseline for conducting public entities online transparency assessment exercises, but also to guide the development of new integrated platforms aiming at facilitating citizens' access to transparency for accountability data.",

This article proposes a model based on fuzzy credibility theory in order to mix different data sources for evaluating operational risk. The results of calculating the OpVaR are compared using both, credibility theory and fuzzy credibility. It can be concluded that these results differ, when the membership of the internal data to the external data set is low. In this case the fuzzy model gives more weight to external data compared to the model that applies credibility theory.",

The problems, with surprising results, are applications of numerical computation, so as to be adequate to all these languages: a certain simple series, with a mathematical conjecture on its limit; and the distance to random points in a circle. The objective of this work is twofold: to emphasize the pertinence of the Web for scientific computing, and to illustrate the productiveness of the modern languages. The authors' opinion is that scientific computing over the Web has lagged behind most of its other uses, and is particularly recommended, namely, in academy, in industry, and in their connection.",

In other sense, the geographical boundaries are diluted, the world today is interconnected by the simultaneity of the new information and communication technologies. Unlike conventional radio, Internet radio immediately sparked the interest of the broadcasting companies, once it did not impose limits on the listener's geographical range, nor on the exclusive audio format programming. These radios have not delayed in employing the technological resources of web radio, fact that can be sustained by the quantitative growth of online platforms, through which people can have access to the ordinary programming in real time by means of a great variety of devices connected to the Internet. This investigation considered it important to analyze the educational potentialities of web radios in the Spanish and Portuguese academic universe.

They have acquired personal computer working capabilities and small sensors that enrich their software applications. However, the development of the usability field for these applications and devices has not improved at such a fast pace. Although there are several standards and evaluation methodologies, there are no specific remote evaluation tools for dynamic environments, which are very representative of this type of device contexts. Consequently, this paper describes a remote assessment platform that records context in use properties and user interactions with the mobile device. A preliminary evaluation of the platform using a real hybrid mobile application is presented, where the interaction bias level introduced by the assessment platform is studied.",

Firstly, we realized a recognition system of the isolated handwritten digits, in this part, the study is based mainly on the evaluation of neural network performances, trained with the gradient back propagation algorithm and fed by several parameter vectors; the objective of this operation is to determine the parameter vector who gives the best performances. The used parameters to form the parameter vectors are extracted on the binary images of the digits by several methods: the distribution sequence, sondes application, the Barr features, The centered moments of image coding according to the Freeman directions, and the centered moments of the different projections and profiles. Secondly, the study is extended for the reading of the handwritten numeric chains constituted of a variable number of digits. Vertical projection was used to segment the numeric chain at isolated digits and every digit (or segment) was presented separately to the entry of the system achieved in the first part (recognition system of the isolated handwritten digits).",

Hypotheses were created based on these factors, so that future research can be applied and evaluated, and thus prove these assumptions.",

As a consequence, the degree of achievement of these competences has to be evaluated appropriately by means of the definition of formal and reliable evaluation processes. In this context, evaluating transversal/soft competences makes this goal specially challenging. This work introduces a method Based on Teachers Reasoning (BoTR) to allow the design of automatic assessment systems for the evaluation of transversal competences of students. BoTR defines a methodology that takes into account the subjective criteria applied by teachers when assessing the considered competence to build an automatic assessment system. After introducing BoTR, we apply this method to assess the teamwork competence for real students of engineering, describing the application of the three stages of the BoTR method in a real scenario.",

    "abstract": "The overall purpose of this project is to test the impact and potential benefits of Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies (AR&VR) to improve maintenance operation in industrial equipment. The main function for a Flapper valve of a Fuller-Kinyon type M pump is to prevent that the air generated to convey the bulk material through a conveying pipe flows inside of the material chute through the rotating screw. If this will occur, the material flow will decrease or even stop, causing a reduction of the pump capacity. Thus, it is necessary to maintain calibrated each flapper valve in the plant. This process of maintenance is done ten times per month, or when necessary, and it needs the pump to be shut down, taking up to two hours to finish the complete process. For this reason, an augmented reality application is being developed, aiming to reduce the consumed time by the maintenance process. Using this application, it is expected to dedicate less time training the new personnel responsible for the maintaining process, displaying tridimensional models, animations, images and text information that would simplify the instructions shown in a printed manual and adding an interactive environment between the users and the information displayed. A mobile device either a tablet or a smartphone is to be used as the hardware that will run the application, allowing the user to take it right to the working area, either in a workshop or directly in field. The information displayed includes CAD models of the pump and its components as well as animations illustrating the instructions to follow in each step of the process. Also, the right tool to use in each step will be indicated following by security warnings when needed. This project was developed from knowledge and experiences gathered among the different previous AR projects developed at ITESM.

However, typical systems are not robust against occlusion because they are using a number of cameras to capture markers placed on the body. Therefore we propose the wearable motion capture system that acquires human motion directly from various points on the body. Furthermore, acquisition of muscle activity with EMG sensor is used for recognition of phase-switching for interaction such as grabbing CG. As a result, we have confirmed it is possible to create more interactive/occlusion-free contents by using wearable motion sensing system.",

The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has often been the theoretical framework supporting the action accordingly and the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) the most used instrument in measuring their level of implementation. Thus, the present study aims to contribute to improving information systems and clinical decision support in the management of diabetes as a Chronic Disease. Also aimed to make the translation and validation of the ACIC 3.5 and assess what level CCM is applied. The ACIC was applied to 175 doctors and nurses in primary care, belonging to a group of health centers. We defined the level of significance of 5%. In terms of results, it is observed that the ACIC Version 3.5 achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.958, indicating a high reliability and a coefficient of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin of 0.918, demonstrating that our data show excellent suitability for factor analysis. The group of health centers studied only guarantees a basic support to people with diabetes. In terms of applicability of the results of the CCM used in the care provision of the diabetic person and the family, let predict a long journey to make in this area.",

As a result of this interest, several studies and theories have been applied to this field, mainly to larger companies, and with a lesser application to the universe of small businesses. Portuguese business context is mainly composed by owner managed companies of the small businesses. The theoretical support that was considered most appropriate to back the analysis was the trade-off theory. The trade-off theory, in general terms, explains the amount of cash reported by companies on their balance sheets. This study is based on a sample of Portuguese manufacturing firms. It uses a methodology of econometric nature, based on models that were constructed to test if the tradeoff theory can explain the amount of cash held by these companies. The modeling considered four key variables (determinants) significant in the explanation of such amounts: the \"net working capital\", the \"debt\", the \"size\" and \"cash flow\". Moreover, after a closer analysis, the results indicate that there are significant differences when if there is or not an auditor that certifies the accounts of the companies is added as control.",

Most countries rely on surveillance systems to monitor the status of the epidemic which are based on cases notification by physicians. It can take several months until the diagnosed cases are notified and there are even cases that are not reported at all. The purpose of this paper is to adjust the Portuguese notification data to these main possible biasing problems. For the reporting delay we will use the traditional conditional likelihood estimation for count data assuming a Poisson distribution. For the cases that are not reported at all, we will use a mixture of Poisson distributions, based on natural conjugate prior distributions, and estimate the unknown parameters through maximum likelihood. The Poisson model suggests that approximately 80% of the Portuguese AIDS cases were reported within one year after the diagnosis and that the majority of cases were notified in the first three months. The BB/NBD model suggests that the probability of a new AIDS case being notified gets higher once a large amount of AIDS cases has been notified.",

A theoretical review of both approaches is performed, including the evaluation methods. Experiments done in seven datasets from 4 different problems show that the pointwise approach is slightly better or similar than the listwise approach. However the models obtained with the listwise approach are more interpretable because they have in average fewer features than the models obtained with the pointwise approach. The obtained results are important for problems where interpretable ranking models are necessary.",

All the work presented here was based on two premises: the use of Scratch as a tool and the students as producers of media, which in turn developed their creativity, problem solving skills, and augmented their media literacy and critical thinking aptitude. In this plan of action, we considered three phases: in the 1st phase we evaluated several methodologies for introducing Scratch; in the 2nd phase we focused on collaborative learning in small groups; in the 3rd phase the focus was on developing a game with the whole class. For the duration of this study, it was noticeable that the group of students easily adapted to Scratch. We concluded that the use of this tool motivates students and improves the learning process. It also contributes to a higher level of concentration and promotes collaborative learning. Additionally, it facilitates creativity, dialogue and the overall relationship among students. The teacher quickly understood that this tool allowed the shift into a pedagogic model based on the collaborative construction of knowledge. At the end of this paper there are suggestions of strategies that can be adopted in order to work with Scratch in the classroom. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for possible future projects in this area.",

    "abstract": "It is imperative to continue thinking and reinventing education because technologies and the Web are redefining where, when and from whom we learn. The motivation to learn can be awakened in students by creating playful environments capable of reconciling the knowledge acquisition in the classroom and practice learning. Authors from different study fields have recognized the multiple possibilities of videogames for learning and for interdisciplinary use. Education can benefit from the potential of these artefacts if properly integrated into the educational process. This article describes an ongoing learning experience based on electronic games. It also presents some preliminary results of the ARCADE games type application in Wordshoot; Flashcards; Matching Pair; Manic Miner and Cannonball Fun formats. This experience is being made with Portuguese and French vocabulary, grammar and school curriculum learning, both in Elementary and Vocational Education.",

One of these tasks consists of modeling the interaction between different species in complex ecosystems. Nowadays, the current tools that allow this task to be performed, such as PSysCal, require huge amounts of computational resources, and also a great deal of computer knowledge to configure the program correctly. Overcoming these obstacles is the main objective of this prototype. Developing this prototype in a cloud environment [2][3] solves the problem of computational resources and supplies the chance to provide more accessible and user-friendly web services. Thus, the implementation of a user-friendly web portal solves the difficulties of configuring the tool and facilitates the ecologist work.",

Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising communication method within nanonetworks, since using electromagnetic waves is not very likely due to the size of the nanomachines. In molecular communication, information is encoded onto molecules at senders and the molecules propagate to receivers in a controlled manner. This control is one of the most important challenges, and this paper will describe some solutions for molecular communication. Since molecular communication offers means to transport information-encoded molecules to receivers and allows biological and artificially-created components to communicate with each other, future applications for health care are discussed in this paper. Results are obtained from computerized simulation scenarios selecting appropriate parameters for optimal performance.",

We will step out from typical current communication paradigm, to a much wider spectrum, where normal “things” will talk to each other, independent of human interaction. Emphasizing its importance in health industry, it can save lives and improve the ageing and disabled population's quality of living. It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems. If we want things to communicate with each other, intelligently and autonomously, then the new future Internet must be structured to allow such thing. The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too. Every new device should be IoT proof for future integration in IoT. In this article, there is a focus on these health-related use cases where they are detailed and explained how IoT could be deployed to aid in specific cases. The second part of the article takes the current IoT problem and tackles its issues, presenting a communication paradigm and proposes a new IoT system's architecture.",

    "abstract": "Typical education in management of software projects lacks practical experience. But experience is essential in under-standing the problems and especially their solutions. A real software project is difficult to practice because of its long duration and the potential of high damage if the project fails. Simulation games in a sandbox are a well-known approach for practicing complex content. But the design and development of such a game needs much knowledge about all the relevant processes that should be simulated. In this paper, we propose a general framework and a method that can be used for developing project management simulation games for an educational purpose in the software engineering domain. We developed a general simulation model including aspects of ergonomic analysis, work psychology, learning theory and software engineering. With this, we are able to simulate not only the working processes but also the character of the developers. It can be used without understanding the simulation model, so there is no need to understand all the complex content behind. Considering existing solutions, our approach supports different types of games, without making limitations to the game design. We show that with adequate abstraction there is no need to develop an own simulation model for each simulation game. Instead, all relevant aspects can be integrated in a general simulation model.",

    "abstract": "The graphical quality of modern videogames are the result of a steep evolution of hardware over the last two decades, but the game controls that are part of mainstream gaming did not change much in the same time period. To change this, biofeedback techniques using physiological sensors are being studied as possible replacements for traditional videogame interaction devices. In this paper, we continue on-going research by introducing unimodal and, for the first time, multimodal biofeedback game mechanics aiming at enhanced depth and expanded game design possibilities. We developed a First-Person Shooter to test these concepts against traditional unimodal mechanisms, and conducted an empirical study with 32 players. Both unimodal and multimodal variants provided high levels of fun to players, with subtle differences suggesting that these types are best leveraged depending on the interaction context on which they are applied.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches to game design improvements rely on gameplay testing, an iterative process following the test, try and fix pattern, relying on target audience feedback via standard questionnaires. Besides being a very time consuming phase, it is also highly subjective. In this paper, we demonstrate a generalizable approach for building predictive models of players' affective reactions across games and genres. Our aim is two-fold: 1) That game developers can use these models to more easily and accurately tune game parameters, allowing improved gaming experiences, and 2) That these models can be used as the basis for parameterisable and adaptive affective gaming. This paper describes our preliminary results regarding a novel, physiological-based method for emotional player profiling, which consists on the following three phases: (i) monitoring players' emotional states and game events, (ii) identifying player's emotional reactions to game events and (iii) individual and cluster-based modelling of players emotional reactions.",

    "abstract": "Mathematics is intrinsic to engineering and as such plays an integral role in the education of engineers. New challenges are being faced in higher education particularly in the areas of student motivation, engagement and attainment. As a result mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. Traditional methods of delivery such as lectures and tutorials need to evolve to counter these challenges with new pedagogical approaches explored including the use of new technologies. Today's students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. This paper describes a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology to develop and explore the use of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that integrates a web-based platform for the study of mathematics as part of an active learning constructivist setting. Students will utilise graphics tablets to create online content consisting of solutions to mathematical problems which will then be used by other students to reinforce core concepts. The platform will provide active support to engineering students especially those in their first year of study and mature students returning to education. It is expected that early use of the platform will help identify areas of weakness and provide the self-learning environment required for students to become more proficient in those areas. By challenging the student to demonstrate an active engagement in their learning and by encouraging the meaningful use of technology in the classroom, an improvement in the quality of learning that students experience should be realised.",

The terms e-learning and b-learning are being overshadowed by u-learning (ubiquitous learning), since the learning scenario is any place and any device that can be used to get the materials. The task of preparing the appropriate materials in this new context cannot be addressed individually and, consequently, international collaborative process can be very fruitful. The main goal is to adapt the study materials for using in several Universities, with official recognition for any University involved in the collaborative process and with agreements with other Universities interested in the use of such materials. We will present an ongoing experience which involves the National Technological University (UTN) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Spanish universities: Salamanca University (USAL) and Pontificia Comillas University (UPCOMILLAS) in Madrid.

This paper presents a sequential mode to analyze and reconstruct the graphical information in a function of two variables, up to display its three-dimensional image. This is done by representing the cuts of the graph of the function with a family of horizontal planes, but placing each contour line in the corresponding sectional plane. Cuts of the graph of the function with different vertical planes are also shown: those with parallel planes to the axial ones, OYZ and OXZ, and those with vertical planes through the axis OZ. The combined display of all these curves produces a much better idea of how the graph of the function under study is.",

The study was performed over a practice of education, which deals with PBL activities with a networked learning approach. Course subjects were the instructional principles and methods. Students enrolled into the course from Hacettepe University Faculty of Education, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology in the academic year 2012–2013. The course was delivered via the Moodle LMS platform. The data stored in the database of the software was extracted to make auditing evaluations about the software, and auditing techniques were applied. A comparison was made between the data received from the software's modules that could be used for auditing purposes and the data on which the auditing techniques were applied after extracting and tutor-oriented evaluations were performed. The evaluations regarding the monitoring, assessing and managing of the teaching process in the activities of the Networked PBL of Moodle software's auditing function were made in consideration of the findings. It was concluded that Moodle was sufficient for meeting the basic data requirements for educational auditing, its modules alone did not have Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) function; a CAATs add-in, which would be created or used for fulfilling the educational requirements, would be useful.",

The paper focused specifically on the use of audit sampling and computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs). The focus of the paper was the banking sector in South Africa. The increasing volumes of transactions that are processed by banks on a daily basis necessitated the internal audit function to adopt strategies in order to obtain audit evidence in a cost efficient manner in the execution of its mandate to senior management and the board of directors. The results derived from the paper indicated that audit sampling is still used more frequently compared to the use of CAATs. An anticipated decline in the use of audit sampling is however expected with an increase in the use of CAATs in the coming years. In addition, all the respondents indicated that the adoption and implementation of CAATs in their audit methodology is a priority within the next 12 months.",

In particular, the features acquired from temporal analysis, wavelet transformation, power spectral density estimation and QRS-complex detection over ECG signals are considered. These features are employed with two distinct classification algorithms, namely decision tree and Bayes network, specifically for gender, age and identity recognition problems. The biometric authentication framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset that contains ECG records of 18 healthy people including 5 men, aged 26 to 45, and 13 women, aged 20 to 50. The results of the experimental analysis reveal that if all those features are used in combination rather than individually, better performance is attained for all classifiers in each recognition problem.",

    "abstract": "The set cover problem, belongs to the branch of combinatorial optimization problems, whose complexity is exponential theoretically established as NP-complex problems. Consists in finding a subset of columns in a matrix of zeros and ones such that cover all rows of the matrix at a minimal cost. In this work, the problem is solved by binary Firefly algorithm, based on the flashing behavior of fireflies, using binary representation. A firefly produces a change in brightness based position between the fireflies. The new position is determined by the change in the value of the old position of the firefly, but the number of the new position is a real number, we can solve this problem with the function tanh binarization compared with a random number generated uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 65 benchmark instances. The results show that it is capable of producing solutions competitivas. virtualización; ultrasecuenciación genetics.",

This problem consists in assigning workers with different skills, to a series of tasks in a software project so that the project is completed in the shortest time and the lowest cost possible. In addition, this allocation must meet the constraints of skill required for each task and the precedence constraints between tasks. The solution to this problem is presented using the Max — Min Ant System algorithm and the Hypercube framework. Two heuristics capable of guiding the algorithm to find better solutions are proposed. Experimental results are presented and compared with other techniques of resolution, showing an improvement by implementing our proposal.",

Although hundreds of experimental studies are achieved especially for English, which is a non-agglutinative language, the number of efforts for Turkish, which is one of the most popular agglutinative languages in the world, is counted something on the fingers of one hand. Therefore, a solution is sought for Turkish spam e-mail problem taking the special characteristics of Turkish e-mails into consideration. The developed spam filtering framework has four components named as morphological decomposition, feature selection, training, and test phases. A fixed-prefix stemming approach is used to extract the features of an e-mail and then the Mutual Information (MI) method is carried out as the feature selection method. The Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers are employed and the recognition accuracies obtained from these methods are considerably satisfactory. The highest accuracy rates are 91.08% for ANN and 87.67% for DT methods when the dimensions of feature vectors are selected as 150×5) and (75×5), respectively.",

    "abstract": "The clustering ensembles mingle numerous partitions of a specified data into a single clustering solution. Clustering ensemble has emerged as a potent approach for ameliorating both the forcefulness and the stability of unsupervised classification results. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is to find the best consensus function. Finding final partition from different clustering results requires skillfulness and robustness of the classification algorithm. In addition, the major problem with the consensus function is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is due to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a novel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks technique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach is used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the quality of databases. This can generates good results and efficient data partitions. To show its effectiveness, we support our strategy with empirical evaluation using distorted speech from Aurora speech databases.",

Moodle is currently the leading virtual learning environment in Spain, and a lot of different plugins have appeared to complement the lack of native tools to track the learning process in all its aspects. However, none of these take the temporal dimension as a possible behavior measurement into consideration. In this case study, a new technical and statistical approach to time tracking of students in Moodle will be discussed, so that time as a behavioral aspect can be considered in further assessments. Furthermore, this approach could not only be applied to Moodle, but to all other online virtual learning environments.",
