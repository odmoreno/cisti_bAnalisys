The type of storage that has been chosen is a NoSQL database-oriented documents, specifically MongoDB it is an early and popular alternative within its scope. Our analysis considers five patterns: Parent References, Child References, Array of Ancestors, Materialized Paths and Nested Sets. An experiment was designed to measure the performance of the database regarding the speed of insert operations, query and indexing as well as the required storage capacity according to each standard used. The database was deployed in the cloud provider as a service MongoLab. The results of the experiment along with their analysis are presented separately showing two tables and 3 graphs appropriately to contrast the differences and approaches between the yield between different patterns.",

We implemented a generic and dynamic dashboard based on real-time information with the aim to assess the impact of the available Data Visualization Techniques in the developed dashboard. Therefore, our Dashboard users will be able to interact with the information, based on an initial set of hints, charts, tables and reports, produced by the Dashboard itself.

Often crude oil palm is marketed as fat or vegetable oil and has a large presence in the production of biodiesel. However, the production of crude oil palm is not exempt from controversy due to its environmental impact, thanks to the massive use of fertilizers and pesticides which call into question its sustainability over time. In this paper we proposes a fuzzy spatial model for the identification of palm units, from the integration of different vegetation indexes obtained from multispectral aerial images taken at low altitude. The integration of this vegetation indexes in a single mapgrid, allowed to identify in a large number of cases points with spatial energy concentration, which indicate the presence of oil palm unit. The results of the model will allow the localized treatment and characterization of oil palm units, generating a future alternative for the reduction of pesticides and fertilizers in this type of crops, ostensibly improving their environmental sustainability over time.",

    "abstract": "The present work aims to describe the methodology used for the development of learning objects (LO) in 3D for Augmented Reality (AR) apps, based on a combination of several methodologies used in the design of LO. The methodology consists of three components: 1) app scope, 2) content, and 3) technology. For the development of 3D LO, the prototype software development approach was used, where phases 2 and 3 are executed in each new version accompanied by the respective quality assurance. As a result of the implementation. The “Biologia AR” was gotten. To validate the resulting app from the methodology, a questionnaire, with 14 items, applied to 223 students was used. The results are that 89.30 percent, consider that the app content is in line with the bibliographic material used in the subject and 75.94 percent indicates that the contents of 3D LO used has allowed them to reinforce their learning. The 77.01 percent mention that the interaction with 3D LO is more didactic than with a plain text. Regarding the inconveniences to access the app, 52.47 percent mentioned that it had some type of inconvenience, mainly in download, installation and use, therefore, it is important to know the types of mobile devices in which the applications of AR is going to be used. Hence, it is guaranteed that the methodology allows AR consistent resources to be generated with the learning outcomes, without losing sight of the digital competences that professors and the students must have.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays there is a growing interest in the use of virtual reality environments because through immersive education participants can be offered a feeling of “being there”, through a synchronous connection that allows them to communicate with a sense of presence. The present work shows the methodology that we used for the implementation of Virtual Worlds (MV). It was developed with OpenSimulator for two subjects of a Distance education system in order to facilitate real practices of judicial hearings. It is exposed as a tactical alternative in the teaching-learning process; in addition, the results obtained are exposed when evaluating the methodology through the use and functionality of the virtual environment by students, teachers and technicians of university centers. The results indicate that 25% of students consider between difficult and very difficult to move within the MV, despite the 75% of students exposed the interaction within the MV was easy and very easy; so that, they mention that it is of great functionality due to the benefits obtained in terms of improving communication with other users and the immediacy of responses; 70% of the technicians participating in the tests were not inconvenienced, while the teachers considered very entertaining how the practice was carried out in the MV.",

    "abstract": "Microservices are considered as a software architecture that allows the decomposition of a system, its components or its functionalities into a set of small services, which are implemented, deployed and managed independently. In this study, the models that allow migrating a Monolith to Microservices such as NGINX and IBM are analyzed. From these models, activities that allow such migration are carefully selected and identified. In order to implement and evaluate the activities proposed in those models, an application that initially does not have any structure at the design and coding level (using PHP programming language) is applied. Then, the application's coding language changes to Java and the classes and libraries are distributed into packages. Subsequently, as it is suggested in the models, services are identified and implemented using RESTful Web Services to finally implement the microservices using technologies such as Spring Boot, Eureka, and Zuul. In the migration process, the application under study is modified at the code and design level, including patterns such as Singleton, Façade, Strangler, Single Service per Host, Service Discovery, and API Gateway, which are used to evaluate performance as a quality attribute in each migration phase. In order to obtain the performance related metrics and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each migration phase, Apache JMeter as tool is used. This tool is set up to generate results regarding the use of resources such as CPU, memory, network, and database access. Finally, the results show scenarios of several concurrent users who access to consult records in the database that uses the aforementioned application in each migration phase.",

This is why it presents the opportunity to investigate and learn about certain neuronal diseases, specifically Alzheimer's based on digital image processing. For this, the use of mathematical models based on specialized software (Matlab), determines the characteristics of the iris establishing criteria or patterns to determine the existence or not of Alzheimer's. For this we have: i) The Fourier Transform to normalize the image; ii) The Hough Transform to locate circles in an image. In addition some learning methods based on three multi-layer classifiers were used: ZeroR, Naïve Bayes and Multi-layer Perceptron. Finally, to distinguish between the different types of pathologies, several samples must be used and well identified, that is, the data must be consistent and with a good resolution to avoid influencing the results.",

However, it depends on the peers' effectiveness in minimizing the intrinsic subjectivity to the process. Publishers try to achieve this through training and guides for reviewers. However, there is no consensus as to what the main criteria for a good review are, which results in poorly reasoned or vague reports that do not assist the editor in his decision nor the author in improvement of research. This project proposes a quality model for reviewing articles and a framework for their automatic classification through machine learning techniques. This proposal will be useful for: i) reviewers as a guideline for the preparation of the review report, ii) editors as an indicator of the quality of the received revisions, and iii) the authors as a model for self-evaluation of their research.",

The GDPR 2016/679 aims to ensure the coherence of natural persons' protection within the European Union (EU), comprising very important innovative rules that will be applied across the EU and will directly affect every Member State. Furthermore, it aims to overcome the existing fragmented regulations and to modernise the principles of privacy in the EU. This regulation will come into force in May 2018, bringing along several challenges for citizens, companies and other private and public organisations. The protection of personal data is a fundamental right. The GDPR considers a `special category of personal data', which includes data regarding health, since this is sensitive data and is therefore subject to special conditions regarding treatment and access by third parties. This premise provides the focus of this research work, where the implementation of the GDPR in health clinics in Portugal is analysed. The results are discussed in light of the data collected in the survey and possible future works are identified.",

    "abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to obtain cartographic information for multiple applications has increased at present. Different researches have focused on specific applications, from their implementation to their automation. This project focuses on the determination of the cartographic precision of the orthophotomosaics generated from images obtained with UAV processed with the Agisoft® software. For this, a TAROT 680 PRO hexacopter was used (with GPS and INS included) to cover one hectare in the Moorlands of Chingaza, reserve area for Espeletia in the northeast of Bogotá (Colombia). A total of 167 photographs were acquired with a Canon A2300 camera. Five ground control points (GCP) were pre-signalized (GCP-P) and positioned with a Gr-5 receiver, in order to adjust the block of images. Due to the weather conditions not all GCP-P were captured in the images. To improve the adjustment of the project, three GCP were subsequently photo-identified (GCP-F) and positioned with the same type of equipment. Three projects were created, one in which GCP-P are included; the second including the GCP-P and GCP-F; and the third one in which GCP is not included. The first two projects correspond to the photogrammetric SfM process and the last corresponds to the direct georeferencing technique. The best results were obtained in the project that used only three GCP-P. Likewise, it was found that including the GCP-F in the adjustment of the block decreases the accuracy of the project, moving from a millimeter to a submetric precision; while not using GCP does not allow knowing the accuracy of the project with respect to the terrain.",

The possibility of using mobile devices for participatory assessment is the focus of this article. The QualIndique application was developed for the iOS platform to enable the school community to participate in data collection using a mobile device. It is concluded that the use of mobile devices can make participatory assessment feasible because it minimizes the costs of printing questionnaires, sending them to INEP and digitizing the data, as well as allowing a greater participation of the school community.",

It was considered a sample of the largest EC websites in the countries and data were collected and analyzed using appropriate techniques. The research concluded that the Brazilian sites are more likely to collectivism than the Portuguese sites, proving only one of the hypotheses formulated.

In the present work we present the results of an empirical study that evaluates the relationship between the different personality factors and the perception regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using a Model - Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. In order to determine personality traits, we have used the PEN model, corresponding to the Eysenck's personality theory. Based on this model, we have used a set of questionnaires to identify (a) the levels of Psychoticism (P), Extraversion (E) and Neuroticism (N) of the subjects and (b) their subjective perception regarding the use of a MDE approach.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 50 years, public health in Latin America has walked through significant changes on social and economic aspects. Since the 90's, governments from the region have performed different health reforms to improve equity, effectiveness and geographical coverage. Although, positive results have been achieved historically, strong and sustainable public health strategies are still needed to guarantee quality service. In that sense, integration of novel devices for monitoring and alerting patients about their physical health stands as a promising option for improving Latin American healthcare systems by upgrading facilities to be able to attend patients remotely, avoid care units overcrowding, guarantee real-time supervision, operational cost reduction, rapid patient attention, and lower investment on expansion of existing areas. Healthcare wearable technology acceptance and adoption barriers were investigated. It was found that most wearables are developed and promoted in developed countries with no headquarters in Latin America. This situation decreasing interest for its adoption by Latin American governments due to poor technical support, high prices, and few distribution channels. Four main barriers for wearable technology adoption were identified as: i) critical data management, security and privacy issues, ii) unreliable results accuracy, iii) unaffordable technology for low-income groups, and iv) lack of clear regulations. Based on the adoption barriers, healthcare wearable technology challenges were identified and presented. The main challenges found were: access to health service, training and distribution of human resources in health, inequalities in health, and financial schemes for health systems. It can be concluded that smart wearables in the healthcare sector could be considered as part of the solution to guarantee proper quality service and coverage in remote areas where no service is currently offered.",

    "abstract": "This research represents a first attempt to explore the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in Chilean companies. Its objective is to determine the factors that influence the adoption of this technology using the unified model of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical framework. An electronic survey was applied to ICT managers of small and medium-sized companies in different areas and the intention to use IoT was analyzed. The results indicate that the intention to adopt this technology is explained by the constructs of UTAUT in 68%, being social influence and facilitating conditions the key factors to explain this phenomenon. The performance expectancy, despite being significant, has a contrary effect to the intention of use as perceived by the responsible of ICT in Chilean SMEs.",

The model will allow obtaining the prediction of box office revenue. Three different dependent variable approaches were used (interval, categorical and binary) aiming to study the difference and predictive influence that each one has on the results. Two metrics were used to determine the most accurate predictions: the misclassification error for the categorical models and the average squared error for the continuous one. In this study, the best predictive results were obtained through the use of multi-layer perceptron. Regarding the representative distinction between the dependent variable, the multiclass model presents a much higher error rate comparing to the remaining ones, which is explained with the increase of the number of classes to predict.",

Previously, the students had programmed the embedded system that moves the LEGO robot arms. Thus, they may compare programming the controller (the NXT brick, in NXC) and programming the industrial robot to execute a specific trajectory (the VAL II program). For that reason, the authors designed a software architecture that includes a wrapper to encapsulate the most relevant commands of VAL II and a programming environment. The wrapper was implemented for the same two degrees of freedom SCARA robot that students had already used. The software architecture provides the following functionalities: (1) simulate the trajectories by means of a simple graphical engine; (2) execute VAL II programs in a 2DoF LEGO robot; and (3) create a low cost remote laboratory.",

The aim was to understand how these systems work, and what advantages and disadvantages exist as well as to understand what awaits us in the future in the pharmaceutical field through the analysis of a real example. A personal interview was performed, in January 2018, with the owner and director of the Giro pharmacy; a session of passive observation was also realized. The aim was to learn about and observe the implementation of an automated system for the distribution of products from storage. The advantage of the system is that it allows for a more personalized service, as the employee does not need to be absent at any time during the delivery of the service. Innovation and its source was also a topic during the interview. International contacts and observing how firms function in other countries which are technologically more advanced (e.g. in Germany) were revealed as being important.",

The analysis of the data was based on the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining approach and for the treatment; we used the Anaconda IPython and Pandas. We developed the prediction with three models using R: Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The comparison of the performance of each of the methods shows that the model based on artificial neural networks has a greater accuracy in the prediction. These results need deepening the study to broaden the universe of the studied contexts. However, the simplicity in the application of the artificial neural networks model makes possible its use in computer applications without specific knowledge, giving a reliable instrument that allows the supporting decision-making by managers.",

The collective online shopping systems emerge in 2008, and may be considered as an effective promotion tool for business partners. In this context, the main goal of this research paper is to evaluate the perception of the business partners on the effectiveness of the last promotional campaign made using a collective online shopping system. Additionally, it is also analysed the consequents of effectiveness. The sample is comprised of 38 global business partners. The results lead to the following conclusions. First, the global effectiveness of the campaigns tends to be positive, mainly due to the non-financial effectiveness. Second, the global and non-financial effectiveness are predictors of their consequents, namely: word-of-mouth marketing, image, returning customers, customer retention, repeat the promotion and recommend promotion, while the financial effectiveness has no influence on any consequent. The existing literature on collective online shopping systems is still scarce. This research contributes to the literature by analysing the effectiveness and identifying the consequents of the effectiveness. From a business perspective, this study may help business partners to evaluate the impact on their business from promotional campaigns using collective online shopping sites and make a decision whether to join or not. From the site managers' perspective, this study may contribute to a better understanding of the perception held by the business partners on the business model's effectiveness and how to better meet their objectives.",

    "abstract": "In many of cities, video surveillance is employed to prevent crime, having hundreds of cameras and sensors monitoring activities during the whole day. Due to the huge amount of video information generated in real time, these surveillance centers are requiring more technology and intelligence to support human operators in many complex situations. There are important analyses that could be realized with this video-data: from criminalistics event detection to particular object recognition. One important tool is License Plate Recognition(LPR) that helps detecting vehicles, that could have been robbed. Although corporative solutions exist, these techniques require a lot of processing power and special located cameras, that not always could be afford by the local government. In this context, the proposed project is based on applying open-source LPR algorithms that runs on already existent surveillance cameras. These cameras are observing a complete scene (not just a line as it is commonly used), so LPR algorithms are rather slow, processing only 1 image per second. For this reason, the objective is to improve the performance combining parallel LPR processing and object tracking algorithms. This work describes the ongoing implementation, the techniques currently used for object tracking and LPR implementation, and exposes results regarding the efficiency of the solution.",

    "abstract": "In the last years research-based programs relevant to sustainability have been developed. Some technological research programs are focused on the design of systems and processes that can be useful for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions as CO2. To diminish the negative impact caused by CO2 for global warming, its chemical transformation in Dimethyl Carbonate is a promising technology. Dimethyl Carbonate is a solvent with low toxicity and due to oxidative capacity can be used as fuel additive. In this work, the membrane reactor technology to improve the Dymethyl Carbonate production is explored from the perspective of modelling and simulation. As a result, a software-based model is implemented, in order to develop and couple different models for describing the membrane reactor. Simulation results showed that the membrane reactor, compared with conventional reactor, increase the reaction conversion and Dymethyl Carbonate production up to 67% and 78%, respectively. Finally, it can be seen that the solution obtained from software-based model allows to conclude that membrane reactor is a promising technology to mitigate CO2 emissions, allowing to achieve environmental sustainability.",

The time spent on Internet goes beyond a simple search or checking the email. Although globalization implies visualizing a trend among various subcultures, the present study seeks to understand if there are differences in the Portuguese users' behavior or perceptions about the consumption of Internet contents in terms of music (or music videos) and movies and television series. Are there sociodemographic differences among Portuguese users? Are the Portuguese users' choices homogeneous in how often they use the Internet to access music and movies online? The answer to these research questions is the purpose of this study. Using the Flash Eurobarometer 437 database, it is identified that age is significantly related to the frequency of using the Internet to access music and movies online. It is also observed that gender is significantly related to frequency of using the Internet to access movies online. The choices facing the Portuguese respondents are not homogeneous regarding the frequency of Internet use to access music and movies online as observed in six clusters with different characteristics. These results can be an indication that policies concerning the music and movies contents should fit the characteristics of each of these clusters.",

This paper is part of a larger research carried out in a Brazilian Salesian institution of higher education on the use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) in the training of undergraduate students. It presents the vision of ninety students who used an institutional VLE. Through an action research, it was observed that the students note the necessity and wish an improvement in the use of VLE. It is concluded that there is a need to maintain the action-reflection-action movement in the teacher's formation, strengthening the listening to the students about several possibilities of using VLE in higher education, that contemplates the student protagonism and his/her capacity of solving real problems still in the moment of formation.",

The system is based on the REST architecture and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) programming language. Thus, both internal modules and external systems can communicate in a distributed, low-coupling and transparent manner, regardless of their locale, development language and hardware platform. For Operational Oceanography, these characteristics bring some advantages, for instance, it provides greater processing power for the execution of numerical models using specific hardware and it is possible to integrate new numerical models. In this sense, the proposed system enables the evolution of the Numerical Oceanographic Prediction System specially core operations of the Almirante Paulo Moreira Institute of Sea Studies (Brazilian Navy), as well as other oceanographic researches in general.",

A set of top-ranked health documents retrieved from a major search engine was characterized in a univariate analysis, and then used in a bivariate analysis to seek features that affect documents' quality. The univariate analysis provides insights into the characteristics of the overall population of the health web documents. The bivariate analysis reveals strong relations between documents' quality and a set of features (namely split content, videos, images, advertisements, English language) that are potential quality indicators. We characterized health web documents and identified specific document features that can be used to assess whether the information in such documents is trustworthy. The main contribution of this work is to provide other features as candidate indicators of quality. Non-health professionals can use these indicators in automatic and manual assessments of health content.",

However, the assimilation of a healthcare information system (HIS) requires organizational changes in the practices of health professionals, which are not easily accepted by them. In a complex organizational context such as health, this information makes the role of the users regarding the adoption of a HIS, an important topic in the field of research of IS. In this sense, it is relevant to investigate how top management's commitment influences the commitment of the professionals in relation to the changes induced by the implementation of a HIS, as well as, in what way the HIS usage enables the achievement of expected benefits from its adoption. A qualitative, interpretative and case-based methodology was used, and the data was collected using semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and direct observation. Two Portuguese public hospitals were analyzed. It was found that top management's commitment, and that of the Clinical Directorate is a key factor in a more rapid and comprehensive implementation of the HIS, influencing professionals' commitment and the usage of the system, which contributes to the increase of the potential expected benefits.",

According to USA (HIPAA) and EU legislation (GDPR) a patient has the right to see his/her clinical information and to know who has access to it, however, the process of obtaining all this related information is still time consuming and complicated. We aim to investigate the opinion of university students regarding the existence of a tool to verify whose healthcare providers access their health information. A web-based questionnaire was designed, 33404 university students were contacted and 589 answered it (1.8% response rate). 90.7% of participants recognize that a tool with those characteristics is important, and 71.5% of them agree to use that tool. In general, we can consider that although the vast majority of participants did not show great knowledge about available healthcare legislation (81%) and that about half of respondents do not know about the use of their data by other parties (52%), more than 90% consider important the existence of a tool to view who accesses their health information. We intend to continue research on this topic and design an access control tool that can empower patients to better control their privacy and rights so to address the gaps existing in the area.",

In these environments, it is not an easy task to ensure the integrity of files handled by the federated clouds due to the fact that they are no longer physically in possession of their owner. Another consequence is the difficulty in protecting against file access from malicious entities. This paper deals with the problem of security in federated clouds, in particular on the BioNimbuZ platform. We propose the use of a file integrity policy based on file hashes, as well as a policy of confidentiality using encryption algorithms. Experiments carried out showed the effectiveness of this approach in verifying the correctness of files and that no-one other than the BioNimbuZ users have access to the information.",

In this context, this work presents a novel platform for the monitoring and optimization of network infrastructures, which interface is easy and intuitive to analyze even for those who do not have high skills in the area of computer networks. Furthermore, and unlike most of traditional monitoring systems, the developed platform has an additional optimization module allowing the recommendation of possible changes/configurations in order to optimize the network resources.",

For this, the Department of Distance and Virtual Education (DeaDV) and the Technical University of Ambato - Ecuador, gave access to the necessary information to the development of this research, they were created in 2017, there were a total of 1966 virtual classes, distributed between 9 faculties and 36 degrees, benefiting 10449 students. With the objective of measuring the rate between the use percentage of the virtual classes created by DeaDV, in the different faculties and degrees in the university, the Anova statistic technique is used in this research. First of all, the numeric variable percentage of the use of virtual classes was proven to comply with the normal condition with the Shapiro Wilk and it also complies with the homoscedasticity assumption with the Levene test. The normality assumptions complied, but not the homoscedasticity, but the equality of the variances is not a limitant to run the Anova test, then it proceeded with the one factor Anova test, which was found to have significant differences in regard to the use of virtual classes, meaning that the use percentage of the virtual classes in the faculties were not the same in all of them, to determine which of the faculties have a greater use of the virtual classes, it proceeded to run Post Hoc tests and compare between faculties with the Games-Howell test.",

Therefore, this study looks into these aspects using a sample of students taking degree courses in a Portuguese higher education institution. The main aims of the study were to identify the terms undergraduates ascribe to the concept of Internet as well as to its advantages and disadvantages, and to assess the frequency of Internet use regarding information search, entertainment and communication. This is a mixed-methods study, being qualitative and quantitative and possessing descriptive and interpretive features. The data was obtained through a survey conducted in the academic year of 2016/2017 and content analysis was the main data treatment technique used. Among the results obtained, we highlight that students' perceptions regarding the involvement, advantages and disadvantages of the Internet are associated with the Internet tools, the actions they can develop with such tools, the contents available and the implications that Internet use may have on its users.",

    "abstract": "Transportation activity is essential for much of the economy, since most economic activities depend on the movement of goods and people. Currently Logistics has been hampered by changes in external and internal environments, such as: delivery time, tracking and fleet management, customer opinion, supplier dependency, economic crisis. Considering the problems reported, as well as new market trends, new business models and technologies, Stepbox was developed. A logistics application of goods deliveries that offers services through shared economy. One of the proposals of the Stepbox is to serve as a channel of communication between the transport service applicants and the companies that provide the transport service. In order to provide innovation in this area, Stepbox offers several value propositions for both the freight forwarder and the companies that provide this type of service. For example: shared economy, smart routes, cargo tracking, delivery value suggestion, check-in, qualification of the product collection and delivery process(gamification), geo opportunity. Finally, the evaluation of the Stepbox proposal was carried out, together with the companies and possible clients of the freight transport service. Based on the results, it was identified that there is a strong indication that the new business model proposed by Stepbox suits the reality of companies operating in the logistics sector and solves the problems described in this paper. This clue was also confirmed by the Startup competitions that Stepbox participated in around Brazil and Latin America.",

    "abstract": "Open Educational Resources (OER) are published massively through websites, but regular users search educational content directly on the Web by using search engines and not on specific OER websites. In this context, the search and location for OER that match users' needs, including those with disabilities, is a key aspect to enhance their use. Currently, the results presented by the search engines do not contain relevant information to guide the users' exploration decision. Therefore, they must verify each resource until they find the right one, which demands an unnecessary effort. This situation becomes a critical issue if users are people with disabilities. The use of structured markup incorporated in the web content is a feasible strategy that can be used to improve the information displayed in the search results. This embedded marked is done through semantic annotations that can be processed by search engines to understand the meaning of the content fragments and provide users with enriched information in the search results. In this paper, we propose the use of a set of properties from Schema vocabulary to adequately describe OER and their accessibility properties, so that they can be used in microdata annotations.",

The students mostly complete the studies; however, they do not finish the thesis an indispensable requirement for obtaining the degree. A factor that helps a student to successfully complete the thesis is the supervisor performance in the thesis development process. Thesis development is an informative, methodological, technological and communicative process in which supervisor and student participate. The purpose of this article is to show the relationship that exists between the supervisor performance and thesis development on Information Technologies, according to the student's perception. The results of a survey directed to 66 students on the supervisor show that there is a positive correlation between the supervisor performance and thesis development. Also, cognitive skills, personal conditions and role of supervisor are correlates positively with thesis Development.",

    "abstract": "Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is an important field of research targeting different applications. The one presented in this work results from an identified need for a wine anti-counterfeiting scheme based on photos of cork stoppers already proposed in previous work. A photo of each cork stopper is used to register a wine bottle during the bottling process. To verify the genuineness of the product a user captures a photo of the stopper; that photo is then compared with the entirety of the database and all the relevant information is retrieved to the user. This approach can be a very slow process, becoming more time consuming with each increase of the database. Aiming to solve this problem, a CBIR system for wine anti-counterfeiting purposes based on cork stopper photos is presented. The feature extraction is achieved using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB), selecting the “best” keypoints (according to the Harris corner measure) per region. The regions are delimited by concentric circumferences calculated using the radius of the identified cork. The number of regions (NR), along with the number of selected keypoints (NP) per region, define the number of ORB descriptors needed for indexing the image in the database. To measure the similarity between the query image and the database a score is calculated based on NR and NP. Finally, the best N images according to the calculated score are retrieved. To evaluate the proposed approach 2 datasets (natural cork and agglomerate cork dataset) were created, totaling 1500 photos, and 4 different smartphone rear cameras were used. The recall results range from 75.0% to 99.5% in the natural dataset and from 86.0% to 99.0% in the agglomerate dataset. The average time for the retrieval process is about 9.74ms in a database populated with 100 photos. Critical analysis on the recall rate and its time tradeoff is also discussed. The results show that the proposed CBIR is adequate for its application - wine anti-counterfeiting.",

They are applied to many applications for prediction purposes, for example, the Predicting Student Performance problem. In this problem, we start from a database where the scores of some academic tasks (exercises, tests, exams) are stored for the corresponding students, considering a particular subject in the academic course. Since some scores for a particular student could be unknown (tasks not completed, submitted or evaluated), they can be predicted considering his behavior in the remaining tasks and the behavior of the other students for these unknown tasks. The prediction is performed by means of Matrix Factorization where the error (Root Mean Squared Error) is minimized by the Gradient Descent algorithm. Nevertheless, two problems arise: the best selection for the main parameters of the algorithms (learning rate and regularization factor) and the best selection for the number of latent factors. In this work, we propose a direct search of the optimal value of latent factors where the calculation for each number of latent factors is driven by a metaheuristic that select, at the same time, the optimal values of learning rate and regularization factor. Using this method, we can determine the best number of latent factors to be applied in further predictions for the similar databases.",

It uses a prediction system that makes use of an Android API for implementation. The keyboard has an elastic layout that manipulates the selected key which is predicted to be clicked next and the victim key which is predicted to not be clicked. It gives the selected key more width and reduces width of the victim key. The application always looks for the victim key which could be on either side of the selected key. The proposed project can well provide an alternative to already available keyboards on the app store which provide on-screen suggestions, something which could easily be annoying for the users. Our application facilitates users to type in at high speed without looking at the keyboard. NexKey also reduces the use of backspace key as demonstrated through empirical validation of the project.",

    "abstract": "Given the complex surgical scenario observed today, it is necessary to change the urgent definition of a specific ontology, especially in terms of aging. The interventions of the Specialist Nurse in Rehabilitation Nursing to the person in the surgical process are primordial for the maintenance of the functional capacities, prevention of complications and impediment of incapacities. However, it is necessary to provide individualized and fostered care in a practice of excellence, and the consequent organized reading of records of an aging ontology for decision making on rehabilitation indicators. Method: a systematic review of the literature was carried out using the EBSCO host (MEDLINE with Full Text, CINAHL Plus with Full Text and MedicLatina), using the PI [C] O method, and 11 articles were selected. Results: 41 indicators were identified to be included in the ontology classes of aging: pain control, patient and family education, support and communication, reduction of postoperative complications, gain of functionality, restoration of physical function, mobility, multidisciplinary intervention and the frequency of interventions. Conclusion: it is considered that it was imperative to identify sensitive indicators for rehabilitation nursing care, based on scientific evidence and thus provide an opportunity for nurses to reflect on their daily practices and conduct their actions towards excellence in care, to propose a set of 41 classes internationally on the ontology of aging.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade gamification has become as a useful strategy for make work environments more dynamic, specifically because it supports initiatives associated with the increase of performance characteristics of work teams such as motivation and commitment. In addition, in work areas such as education, gamification has spread as a useful strategy for make the classroom more dynamic. On the other hand, in the area of software engineering, the performance and productivity of the work team have been identified as key success factors, with motivation being an essential factor in achieving this success. Therefore, there is an important growth of gamification strategies in the classroom as alternatives to increase the motivation and commitment of the work teams. However, the existing teaching strategies in software engineering omit certain details about how to structure a possible learning environment, such as the classroom. In this work a methodological structure is proposed to gamify an educational environment of software engineering. The objective of this proposal is to contribute to the decrease of causes of failure of software development projects within which is the lack of motivation and commitment as well as social and human factors that affect processes related to software engineering. An example of activities developed in a course of agility for software process improvement of the Universidad de Medellín is presented. The methodological structure proposed was designed using technological tools and web 2.0 tools that managed to accompany the teaching-learning process taking into account defined gamification principles.",

By opposition, there is little prevalence of experimental work and, an abstract and, encyclopedic teaching continues to subsist, which often resorts to outdated and unrelated data of the student's reality. One possibility for the enrichment of the learning environments in Sciences is the Internet of Things that can enhance “hypersituation” environments of learning with data obtained in real time and contextualized in the reality of the student. This article presents an overview on the use of the Internet of Things in Education, highlighting potentialities and challenges, and listing some of the programmatic contents of Physical and Natural Sciences (grades 7th to 9th) that can be approached using the Internet of Things. Finally presents a device based on Internet technology of Things designed to be used in classes of Natural Sciences and Physics of the 3rd cycle of Basic Education Portuguese (levels 7th to 9th).",

    "abstract": "Background: Rehabilitation Nursing assumes a fundamental role in contemporary society in the response to the installation of new paradigms of chronic illness and dependence, induced by demographic aging and the advent of a large number of associated comorbidities. Health indicators sensitive to Rehabilitation Nursing care reflect how these nurses contribute to the health of the population in order to achieve health gains. It is necessary to define and contribute to the ontology of aging, which will allow, using machine learning processes, to provide foundations for knowledge acquisition and support for professional decision-making. Objective: To determine the indicators to be included in the ontology of aging, in relation to nursing care of rehabilitation of dependent elderly people in self-care with various comorbidities. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Articles published between 2012 and 2017 were selected by searching the MEDLINE, CINAHL and MedicLatina database, using PI [C] OS methodology, resulting in the selection of 11 articles. Results: We identified 30 sensitive indicators of Rehabilitation Nursing care in relation to the dependent person in self-care with comorbidity. As a proposal for inclusion in the ontology of aging. From the qualitative synthesis of the indicators, improvements were observed in the variables: Readaptation and Functional Reeducation; Wellness and Self Care; Symptom Control; Prevention of Complications; Psychological Support; Customer Satisfaction; Use of Health Services; Quality of Life; Promotion of Social Inclusion; Self-management of Disease and Health Promotion. Conclusions: This systematic review of the literature, which is part of the development of an ontology of aging and its integration into the discipline of Rehabilitation Nursing, aims to provide valid contributions to the corpus of knowledge on which its practice is based. The recognition of indicators sensitive to rehabilitation nursing care is an opportunity for reflection on praxis and a means of conducting to excellence in care and the development of the ontology of aging in international terms.",

Thus, it is imperative to systematize them in scientifically measurable indicators to demonstrate the benefit that rehabilitation nursing brings to improve patients' quality of life, thus ensuring excellence. Each area of scientific health should contribute to the construction of aging ontology. Objective: to identify indicators sensitive to nursing care of rehabilitation, in terms of self-care, in relation to those with respiratory pathology, to be integrated into the ontology of aging. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the EBSCO (full-text MEDLINE, CINAHL, Full-Text Plus, British Nursing Index), using the PI [C] O method with 6 emergent articles. Results: A total of 20 indicators were identified, including: Ability to perform activities, increase physical and functional independence, symptom management, reduction of complications, increase in quality of life, which can be allocated as a proposal for classes of the aging ontology. Conclusion: Knowledge of indicators sensitive to nursing care recognition of the importance of rehabilitation nursing in increasing self-care and autonomy for people with respiratory pathology, and research in this area is fundamental for its effectiveness and efficiency, and its integration in the ontologies of aging is fundamental.",

These elders usually present multiple diseases that require complex tools to identify the exact cares that they need.

Nevertheless, these frameworks are usually questionnaires that have to be performed by already overloaded professionals.

Such a module can work as a data input for traffic management systems in addition to more traditional sensors such as the magnetic loop detectors. We also present a novel approach to the vehicle classification problem based on the use of a fuzzy set. To illustrate the proposed approach, the detection and classification algorithms implemented were tested with different cameras in different scenarios, showing promising results.",

In this context, the use of Business Intelligence (BI) platforms has been shown to be an effective choice in support of decision-making. BI platforms are becoming a major asset for any Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME), as they have multiple benefits: efficient resource use, increased market share, identification of business opportunities and negative trends. Open source BI platforms provide most of the functionalities available in commercial solutions without licensing costs, and is therefore a viable alternative for SME. However, it is critical that SME choose the complete BI platform. In this paper, a comparative assessment was made of three commonly used Open Source BI platforms: Jaspersoft, Knowage (SpagoBI) and Pentaho. In this evaluation were used the criteria of Gartner, and the Knowage obtained the best results.",

In this work, we introduce a module to automatically categorize incident tickets, turning the responsible teams for incident management more productive. This module can be integrated as an extension into an incident ticket system (ITS), which contributes to reduce the time wasted on incident ticket route and reduce the amount of errors on incident categorization. To automate the classification, we use a support vector machine (SVM), obtaining an accuracy of 89%, approximately, on a dataset of real-world incident tickets.",

This article describes an innovative practice of Blended Learning Supported on a Learning Management System (LMS) whose aim is to enable older people developing digital skills through the using of multimedia teaching materials. The sample of older people was made of 53 Old Females (68 ± 7.61) and 28 Old Males (72.5 ± 7.27). 61 older adults participed in the face-to-face workshop on digital literacy and 20 participed in the blended workshop. Later, a Usability Test was summited to the adults who used the LMS. The results showed that the blended workshop is a very good idea as long as it is used as a support system, because if it were adopted in a totally asynchronous manner, they would have difficulties using it due to lack of assistance.",

Following the psychological perspectives in the context of rewarding, we study how motivation, reward emotions and task emotions can change problem-solving behavior, using the case of number puzzle solving task (Sudoku). The results indeed indicate that there is a relationship between problem-solving behavior and positive reward emotions which were caused by the leaderboard. Also, the results show that a positive emotional reaction to the task could improve problem-solving behavior in a monetary reward condition. Implications in the design of rewarding programs are discussed as well.",

    "abstract": "The growing need for Healthcare Information Systems that meets standards of rigor and demand, as well as the need to provide health researchers with the best quality data, has created a major challenge with regard to interoperability in information systems. Nowadays it is common patient data to be dispersed by various systems. Modern systems are tending to adopt standards for modelling and communicating information, but this is not true for legacy systems, where the precision in terms of medical concepts are not standardized. Many times these systems are developed solutions to a specific needs of a medical service, without care for the terminology of clinical concepts representation or how it is structured in terms of semantic. Research relies heavily on the available data, and in context of Big Data analysis, the possibility of aggregating data from multiple, different and distributed sources in a meaningful and straightforward way is relevant. The main objective of this work is to propose an integration architecture that enables access to clinical data from different heterogeneous sources for research purposes. This paper presents an architecture based on the openEHR standard and a proof of concept of the mapping component that provides a tool for matching the attributes of openEHR Archetypes/Templates and fields of databases. With this approach all the data distributed in various repositories, legacy or openEHR are potentially available to the researcher, through the creation of AQL queries in order to get aggregated results for additional research activities.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have extended the application of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to a wide range of different domains, including shared services with various purposes. With regard to transport systems, shared services enabled through technological solutions, especially in mobile space, have many benefits, such as mitigating traffic congestion and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, among others. In addition, with the population of large cities rising more than ever, citizens are becoming more sensitive to societal issues and other performance measures imposed by the new concept of smart cities. This work will study the literature with the objective of verifying the proposals and limitations of existing studies, prototypes and simulations, in order to provide a systematic evidence-based view of how the scientific community is applying MAS to leverage shared services for the implementation and feasibility of intelligent mobility solutions. In the course of the studies, we conclude that although some authors came to propose conceptual models and systems prototypes, the simulation component has been little explored and only synthetic data has been used. One of the reasons justified by the authors relates to the high costs of carrying out simulations. We did not find in the literature proposals that were effectively implemented and tested in the real world, but only prototypes and proposals of future developments.",

The purpose of this article is to present the use of a mobile application to facilitate the process of information flow between institutions that provide social assistance to children and adolescents within the Distrito Federal, providing communication with people who are likely to collaborate with donations. For the application development were used the Challenge Based Learning and Scrum methodologies. The Doei app was developed in iOS and is available for free download at the App Store. It is concluded that the awareness of people to engage in the social good is the great challenge of this application, considering that the technology only allows to mediate the interaction of who needs with those who have items to be donated.",

    "abstract": "Learning programming languages is essential for computer applications development and naturally for the technology evolution. The conventional teaching model of the subjects of initiation to programming is based on a set of tasks that usually result in a series of difficulties for the students which leads to an exhaustive monitoring by the teachers. It turns out that one of the main problems is that students often do not know if their work is correct (i.e. whether it works for a pre-defined data set) until it is reviewed and evaluated by the teacher. In this context, the Virtual Learning Environment becomes an attractive and interesting tool to help teach (and learn) programming. One of these tools is VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) a plugin of Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment). We believe that the use of VPL may represent a paradigm shift for students, but also, and especially for teachers, because teachers will have to spend much more time upstream to prepare tasks and activities, test the environment and verify validation of the data. However, it is important to note that downstream teacher effort can significantly reduce because students do not need as much attention given that feedback on the quality and functionality of the code developed is immediate. This work is a part of a PhD in Research at Information Technology in the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and has been developed from the last 12 months. This Ph.D. research aims to analyze the VPL's integration potential in the programming teaching-learning process in higher education. It also aims to verify if, with VPL, it is possible to make student's learning more effective and autonomous, with less time and effort spent by teachers in assignments evaluation. In the present article, we will present a work-in-progress where we will show how VPL was introduced in a teaching-learning process supported on JAVA programming. The teaching method uses EduScrum methodology and is included in the course of Computer Engineering of the Department of Informatics Engineering of the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto (ISEP / P.PORTO). The first results of this process will be presented.",

    "abstract": "Improve urban public transport service is an issue that worries the authorities that plan, regulate, and control this service, given its importance in sustainable development, since this service allows you to integrate the city, decrease the number of vehicles on the streets, reduce traffic congestion, minimize the emission of pollutant gases, as well as lower costs of mobilization of its inhabitants. To address the existing problems in the public transport service, a method of research with qualitative approach and a design whose model consists of a set of decisions in spiral, which are based on repeated cycles of analysis was used to conceptualize and redefine the problem over and over again, integrating the work with the following sequential phases of action: planning, identification of facts, analysis, implementation and evaluation. As a result of the work done, is managed to develop locally-new technologies for improving the procedures of planning, programming, operation and administration of the service of urban public transport in the city of Loja, known as SAE, SIR, SIU and SIVIG technologies that through a methodological framework, it was transferred to leadership, administrative and operational staff of four operators which provide this service in the city of Loja, as well as staff of the municipality. The results could generate new products and services to strengthen the provision of public transport services, which are being used in the city of Loja. This article shown the ways to plan, operate and manage public transport in the city of Loja based on the spiral model of action research and the use of web and mobile applications for an adequate management of an smart transport.",

The informants are Brazilian Master's level students who were on an exchange program to Portugal, at a major Portuguese university. Brazil, and in particular Rio de Janeiro, the focus of this study, are seen to have talented people and to be also open to technology - on the developing side as well as on the user side. Trust issues still exist - concerning e-commerce - and may indeed be pervasive in society. Brazil is currently undergoing a profound social and economic crisis, which it is trying to recover from. Indeed, the general lack of safety and security felt in Rio de Janeiro may even be a reason for the popularity of home and work deliveries - so that citizens will not have to travel - with travel constituting an additional risk which many may prefer to avoid. Thus, technology (a diverse set of apps) may be serving an additional purpose - that of ensuring security in daily life in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Some countries in South America such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have increased their presence in the production and export of orchids. Ecuador has 14% of the world's species and in 2014 its orchid exports increased 8%, this shows the importance of this product for the country. An orchid greenhouse is a botanical garden specialized in the cultivation, preservation and exhibition of orchids, these places require that physical variables such as ambient temperature, humidity and illuminance to be continuously monitored and controlled for the proper growth of orchids. The present work proposes the design, prototyping and deployment of a wireless sensor network for the monitoring of physical variables in the Municipal orchid greenhouse of Loja, based on open hardware technology. As a result, two prototypes were implemented: one from the variable monitoring node and the other from the central node for visualization and recording of variables. For the validation of the prototypes, performance tests were carried out in the field. Approximately 3000 samples were obtained with a 100% reliability rate in the transit of the data within the process of acquisition, transmission, reception and storage.",

    "abstract": "In this days, learning in the classroom is moving at a much slower pace than technologies. Thus, the use of ICTs in education allowed the classrooms to expand and transcend the limits of space and time, a situation that although it has enormous advantages, it is necessary to provide pedagogical characteristics that make them more user-friendly both as a teacher and as a student. The need of professor as a guide, planner, mentor and evaluator in the learning process is indisputable, that is technological developments should support these tasks taking into account didactic aspects and not only technical ones. One of the challenges that emerge is the need to personalize learning according to the student's abilities and the characteristics of the object that is learned. This paper present a conceptual model of an intelligent system that uses the concept of learning paths based on portfolios. For this, the system takes into account both the different levels of assimilation of knowledge that a student can achieve as indicators of learning that give professor the guide of the progress in the learning process. In this way, a learning route is proposed that seeks to achieve the highest levels of learning possible for a particular student through the use of study materials adapted to each situation.",

The investigation of these effects is performed considering the moderating role of ambidexterity on the proposed relationships. This investigation advances a theoretical model tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). A 90-item questionnaire exploring the relationships between DCs and marketing and innovation was developed, and a total of 387 valid questionnaires were collected from a sample of Portuguese enterprises. The results show the existence of a positive direct and indirect influence of DCs on competitive advantage and performance variables as well as a direct impact on MCs and ICs. This study contributes to filling the gap in the existing research on the direct impact of DC's variables on competitive advantage and performance by considering mediating role of MCs and ICs.",

    "abstract": "IT governance ensures that the needs, conditions, and choices of stakeholders are decisive of IT planning. To reflect on such planning and to enable the implementation of IT governance, can be used the framework: COBIT 5. The COBIT 5 Goals Cascade translates these needs into customized, achievable and specific institutional objectives. Innovation Processes, such as Design Thinking, are typically used to stimulate creativity with a central focus on the stakeholders. This process can also be employed to assist in the implementation process. This paper reports a case study on the construction of the Goals Cascade of the Department of Information Technology from Federal Public Defender (STI/DPU) — Federal department of Brazil. During the process, instruments, maps and validation meetings were developed with the agency's managers. In less than a year, it was possible to structure the cascade which allied with the application of the techniques of Design Thinking allowed the revision of IT planning to reach an IT position in a more strategic way.",

The system concept is based on technology to support citizen's co-creation providing information to a certain place - Cuscaria - whether it's a tourist spot or a coffee shop where people come together. Anyone can create a Cuscaria but need to contact the platform owners to mark the local with a beacon and with a theme. To access the information available for each Cuscaria, share experiences and emotions related to it, it is necessary to travel to the place where it is, to access its physical identifier (Beacon). Hence, anyone is able to find other people with the same interests and at the end of the day this system and concept promote in an effective way a place of acquaintance where is possible to achieve an interesting place to socialize. Also, it's possible to apply analytics to the platform to check trends and to support local strategies.",

    "abstract": "Spatial data is data or information that contains a geographical component. Its representation is considered to be increasingly important in decision-making and it is therefore necessary to guarantee access to spatial data in an easy, intuitive and fast way. The main problems of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are the large amount of information and performance of relational databases (RDBMS) in storage and in unstructured spatial data queries. This problem is significant, since the efficiency of accessing large amounts of spatial data over the Web today is important for conducting on-demand and real-time queries. This work presents a solution to improve efficiency in accessing large amounts of spatial data through the Web, by standardizing spatial data formats. This proposal, called Web GIS, uses the NoSQL MongoDB database engine and provides the spatial data in GeoJSON via a REST API. The results show that MongoDB has substantial advantages over relational databases in storing and querying large amounts of unstructured spatial data, since it supports the storage of data with different structures and also by the efficiency of its spatial operators.",

This current system has some deficiencies, among them the shortage of drinking water when the demand of the users is higher than the nominal one; and the large waste of potable water when the demand is lower than the nominal one. The present work proposes the design, implementation and integration of a monitoring and automation system applied to the JAAPS-LA pumping system, based on a wireless sensor network, open hardware and a PLC. As a result, all the modules of the system were implemented: the liquid level acquisition module in the distribution tank by means of liquid level sensors; the wireless data transmission and reception module; the drive module of the pump by means of the Programmable logic controller (PLC); and, finally, the solar-photovoltaic energy capture module. To evaluate the performance of the monitoring and automation system implemented, the behavior was monitored for 4 days, with the data obtained it was possible to verify the correct pump drive logic and the high efficiency (100%) of the communication system.",

The relational nature of such information is kept in the Animal Transit Guides (GTA), a mandatory issuance in Brazil. When evaluating such set of information, this work aimed at characterizing the bovine movement network in the state of Pará through the application of concepts from Social Network and Network Theory analysis. Where the nodes and edges that structure the network are respectively the rural properties and the number of cattle moved between them. The results obtained characterize the bovine movement in the state, which show distinct patterns such as the movement of a great number of animals rambling and a clear seasonality due to commercialization purposes. The evaluation of the network components' modularity also shows the subdivision of the state in four commercial clusters, where the central measures of its components define municipalities of economic and epidemiological interest. The results described herein help in the support of health surveillance and control measures, as well as the adoption of economic strategies and policies.",

In our environment the consumption of bottled water is the healthiest option for users. Therefore it is necessary that there are enough water purification plants in the locality, so that its production can supply the growing demand, however local companies have a manual and inefficient process. Based on the above, the design of an architecture of an automation system is proposed, which has two main functions: 1) control the level of liquid in the main storage tank, and 2) automate the process of packing the commercial drums by means of time-based dosing. The proposed system is based on an embedded system whose core is the ATMega32A microcontroller, float level sensors and an actuator system based on electrovalves. The performance of the prototype of the automation system was satisfactory since it avoided 100% of stockouts and overshoots of the liquid. In addition, the correction constants of the fluid dosing process were generated in order to obtain errors of less than 5% of the nominal volume of commercial water drums.",

    "abstract": "Average life expectancy of the humans has been increasing with the advancement of medicine, hence observing an aging of the population in general. Associated with aging, loss of cognitive ability and memory failure are often observed, which can have a great impact on the quality of life and autonomy of people who need to take medication on an hourly basis. In this work, we present the development of an application that helps to manage two key issues for the quality of life of the elderly: the time of medication and the time of medical consultations. The application is managed (information is added, altered or deleted) by a responsible, as a family member or health professional. After analyzing several solutions, it was verified that the biggest problem identified is the difficulty of interaction with the interface (sometimes it presents a lot of information and do not focus on functions of immediate necessity). In this context, we present a solution that focuses on two main objectives: first, to present a clear and simple list of medication and list of information of consultations; and second, to provide a simplified interface for the management of medication by a caregiver (child, nurse, and tutor). In the first development phase, we evaluated the usability of this interface, with ten health care professionals, who evidenced the potentiality of the solution presented here.",

It is estimated that a trillion of physical objects will be connected to the Internet until 2022. The low accessibility and the lack of interoperability of many of these devices in a vast heterogenous landscape will make it very hard to design specific security measures and apply specific security mechanism. Moreover, IoT networks still exposed and vulnerable to attacks aimed to disrupt the network. Therefore, additional security tools specific to IoT are needed. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) could fulfill this purpose. In this paper, we present a literature review on the IDS in IoT topic, mainly focusing on the current state of research by examining the literature, identifying current trends and presenting open issues and future directions.",

However, the consequences of a human error in these tasks can be: waste of water (vital resource) and energy consumed by the pumping system, and shortages from the DWTP to users. This demonstrates the need to design a low-cost technological architecture for the automation of the water pumping and storage system applied to DWTP. As a result of the project, a prototype was developed with electronic components compatible with the IoT paradigm, and it was applied in the purification stage of the DWTP of the city of Catamayo. To evaluate the operation of the prototype of the automation system, data was obtained from the input / output variables, for 24 hours every 6 seconds. The variables simultaneously acquired in field tests were: minimum level status, maximum level status, pump activation status, and manual / automatic mode of operation. With the signals, it was possible to confirm the correct logic of the pump drive and the high efficiency of the communication system.",

Consequently, monitoring of temperature and time is very important during the pasteurization process. If this monitoring is done manually, this negatively affects the quality of the product and the safety of the operating personnel of the process. Based on the previous problem, the purpose of this project is to design a low cost and portable architecture for temperature monitoring in dairy product silos. As results obtained, a functional prototype was developed and evaluated in the Lactofino industry. The prototype captures the data by means of an RTD sensor, conditions them, visualizes them and finally identifies and alerts the operator about the stage of the process in which the dairy product is located. For the evaluation of the prototype, the comparison of the temperature measured by the prototype and by a reference instrument was made, the maximum absolute error obtained was 1° C.",

That is why the following work addresses the design, simulation and implementation of a temperature control and monitoring system within a Turkish bath, seeking the comfort of users. The system consists of a sensor module which provides an input signal of RTD PT100 temperature sensor. Subsequently, the acquisition card processes the data to then send a signal when the temperature inside the Turkish bath reaches the maximum threshold established, consequently the valve releases the steam to reduce the temperature to the minimum threshold, once this lower threshold has been reached the valve closes the steam release. Finally, the system was developed and implemented, being evaluated in the hostel “Mi compadre” fulfilling the proposed objectives, to give security and comfort to the users.",

For tackling such need, we will describe a proposal for a secure, decentralized and shared repository of certified personal attributes. Service providers, which are the entities that need to gather such attributes, can benefit from a proper certification by the entities responsible for them. The certifying entities can benefit, because they retain the power to revoke previously issued certifications. Finally, individuals benefit because they have full control over the disclosure of their set of certified personal attributes, namely to service providers, in order to assert their identity.",

The idea is that each cell processes families of parts, thus reducing movements of the parts among cells. The main reason to perform this procedure is to reduce cost and time in the production of parts. To solve this problem, we use the Spider Monkey Optimization metaheuristic (SMO), an algorithm based on nature that has a fission-fusion social structure. This has resolved 90 instances of the problem of manufacturing cells, taken from the experiments of Boctor. The results obtained have shown that the SMO algorithm is able to successfully reach all the optimal values.",

Within the coffee production chain is the roasting phase, which is the most important stage in which the coffee bean undergoes physicochemical changes that provide its sensory characteristics such as aroma and flavor, however there are companies and producers in general that do it empirically. Based on the foregoing, the objective addressed in the present project is to propose an architecture for monitoring the roasting temperature, low cost, portable and compatible with coffee roasters used in our geography.

Among the most used techniques to extract essential oils is distillation by water-steam drag, however to guarantee safety in terms of work accidents, and, in order to homogenize the quality of the extracted oil, there is evidence of the need for these processes to have an automatic temperature controller, which governs the process. Based on the previous problem, the objective of the present project is to develop an architecture for automatic regulation of temperature in processes of extraction of essential oils. As a result of the present project, a prototype temperature controller was implemented and its behavior was evaluated in a laboratory distiller. In the evaluation of the behavior of the temperature controller, a rise time (Tr) of approximately 15 min., settling time (Ts) greater than 40 min., and steady state error (Ess) less than 2 °C were obtained.",

In this paradigmatic shift, technology plays a key role and organisations must know, understand and dominate the intricacies of industry 4.0. However an issues arises: aren't we putting technology ahead of the processes?. The truth is that I40 project are being implemented in different velocities in different companies and regions, even a small country like Portugal. Actually, despite of industries leaders agreed on the importance of the technological requalification (maybe pushed by the mediatism of the 4th industrial revolution), there is a lack of installed capability to embrace such projects. This concern is amplified when considering Portuguese sub regions. The impact of the I40 concept in the Portugues sub regions is the main motivation for this study on the Tâmega e Sousa region. The study combines the perspective/situation of the industry and the software houses. The way the I4.0 concept is being understood by the organisations in the Tâmega and Sousa region, and the degree of preparation for the phenomenon is discussed in this paper. The awareness of the lack of preparation of the organisations for the adoption of I40. strategies or I4.0 projects I4.0, together with the inability of the region's software houses to reverse this situation, led to the presentation of a practical set of recommendations. The framework of recommendations pragmatically translates the different dimensions associated with the challenges inherent in I4.0.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a natural process inherent in being human. During the aging process a person's physical and mental condition will degrade, imposing limitations on their life, which can have a great impact on their well-being. Although they are common to all humans, the consequences of aging can be aggravated by the decline in social relations and contact with family and friends. It is therefore of the utmost importance to maintain these relationships throughout life. In this sense, we intend to develop a system to support these people, allowing them to overcome their limitations, promoting and reinforcing the bonds between the user and the elements of his family and group of friends, using the technology. In this article we discuss the prototyping of a support system for the elderly to combat the lack of interaction between these individuals and their social group. With the use of prototyping it is intended a previous validation of the concept and functionalities of this system. The user is placed within the development process and, in this way, it is possible to evaluate the Human-Machine Interaction component and to detect possible problems so that they can be solved in a timely manner. This is an iterative process in which the system is constantly evaluated and readjusted until it is validated.",

Although several models and frameworks propose sustainability definitions, sustainability meaning is still emerging. Given that sustainability can be studied as a nonfunctional requirement or a quality attribute, this paper aims at exploring the sustainability concept from the software quality perspective based on approaches for classifying quality models. As a work in progress, the proposed classification scheme was piloted with papers gathered from a previously published literature review about sustainability and software quality. As a result, the classification scheme allows identifying purpose, domain, number of quality-related terms, sustainability dimensions, among others. However, other aspects, such as categorizing analysis models and validation approaches, might improve the classification scheme.",

Real-time monitoring allows the detection and early correction of unfavourable situations, optimizing consumption and protecting crops against diseases. This work describes an automatic system for monitoring farm environments with the aim of increasing efficiency and quality of the agricultural environment. Based on the Internet of Things, the system uses a low-cost wireless sensor network, called Sun Spot, programmed in Java, with the Java VM running on the device itself and the Arduino platform for Internet connection. The data collected is shared through the social network of Facebook. The temperature and brightness parameters are monitored in real time. Other sensors can be added to monitor the issue for specific purposes. The results show that conditions within greenhouses may in some cases be very different from those expected. Therefore, the proposed system can provide an effective tool to improve the quality of agricultural production and energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of the digital era, new technologies have brought technological changes, which have permeated the industry, the media and, in general, society. These technological advances should encourage that education pass from the transmission of content to the creation of meaningful learning environments. The lack of these changes means that students must overcome a series of situations that range from very rigid courses in their methodology, centered on the teacher, and not on the learner, generating apathy and disinterest in learning. Therefore, this work proposes to use teaching-learning methodologies that allow a greater participation of the student during their cognitive process, involving their interests and passions, facilitating collaborative work, and above all, generating motivation to learn. This is why this article proposes a methodological approach aimed at teaching-learning programming based on the development of video games with the purpose of engaging and motivating students during their learning.",

All this is carried out through wireless sensor networks that allow measuring a variety of punctual characteristics, necessary for decision making. By having a wireless connection, the challenges that arise become more aggressive and one of the most critical is the consumption of energy, since the sensors, being limited hardware devices need communication protocols and access controls to the environment (MAC) more efficient. This article aims to indicate the most efficient Access Control protocols (MAC) in the energy field over a wireless sensor network (WSN). With this, it is expected to obtain a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the energy consumption required by each MAC protocol and offer a recommendation to increase the useful life of sensor networks, conserving energy as much as possible.",

In the field of education, in spite of the efforts made to include people with disabilities, the indices of exclusion and inequity persist that make possible quality and equality teaching and learning processes. However, as evidenced by the lack of assistance and attention for the realization of an inclusive education, particularly for the population with hearing disabilities, we can also mention the growing interest in developing projects based on technologies that facilitate the development of skills and improve the processes inside the classroom. Taking into account the above, this article shows a research project that consisted of the design and implementation of a virtual classroom of inclusive learning aimed at students with hearing disabilities. The results obtained show the importance of technological tools in the teaching processes of non-inclusive populations, by improving processes of interpretation analysis in a secondary course in the area of mathematics of a school in the City of Bogotá, Colombia.",

Therefore, currently doesn't exist a market without being related to software. In parallel, there has been developed a set of models and standards for quality assurance. This is the reason why in the software industry the resources focused on software quality assurance have been increased, this is reflected in the large number of quality models such as: CMMI, ISO/IEC standards among others, which contain practices that help organizations to achieve better levels in quality assurance. Besides, this has generated the development of tools to support the quality assurance. This paper presents a systematic review to identify the tools and practices that are implemented to ensure quality in the development of software products and services. Moreover, an analysis of defect types with higher value in the software products is performed.",

With this information, a new generation of personalized services may be supported, as users can be provided with the content they need, although they are not aware of those necessities. In this paper a next-generation personalized service provision platform supported by cyber-physical sensors is proposed. Employed cyber-physical sensors include a mathematical model to extract information about the users' motivation. In this first implementation, motivational information is employed to offer adequate content to users in order to enhance their experience. An experimental validation is also provided in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed technology.",

    "abstract": "Maturity models (MM) have been introduced, over the last five decades, as guides and references for the information system management in organizations from different sectors of activities. In the education sector, MM have also been used to evaluate higher education institutions (HEI) in several dimensions, such as ICT, management, process management, course curricula, course/HEI accreditation, e/m-learning, online courses and pedagogical strategies. The HEI have an enormous complexity due to the specificity and quantity of their processes, demanding capable information systems (IS) and tools to manage these IS. Based on the guidelines of a methodology for a systematic literature review, the MM of different subareas of education are identified and categorized in this paper. For each MM associated with HEI IS, it is identified the methodology of development and validation, as well as the scope, stages and their characteristics by dimensions. This study resulted in the need to develop a MM for IS that supports HEI in their core business activities and management.",

This text illustrates our methodology of computing “over the Internet”, and presents a conjecture in Statistics to determine σ (standard deviation) from sums of samples of unequal size. The computing application runs on heterogeneous remote servers in parallel, one in Linux and one in Windows, as might befit a company. The conjecture is “verified” by Monte Carlo, a typically time-consuming technique, itself suggesting parallelization. We have here as objectives: to propose a solution to the statistical problem; to show the use of heterogeneous remote parallel servers; and to point to the Internet as a suitable computing medium.

First, the literature on the influence of the volume of potential beneficiaries on the success of offline fundraising campaigns for charitable causes is reviewed. Second, hypotheses are proposed linking the determinants identified in the literature to DCF campaigns. Thirdly, their explanatory capacity is measured through quantitative analysis based upon a database of 360 campaigns fostered by nonprofits via Microdonaciones, a donation-based crowdfunding digital platform, for the period 2012-2017. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses proposed. Results confirm that donation-based crowdfunding campaigns for charitable causes promoted through digital platforms and resulting successful, tend to be small and limited concerning the volume of potential beneficiaries intended to be assisted.",

Usually, the deployment of an indoor positioning system must be adapted case by case, according to the infrastructure and the objective of the localization. A particularly delicate case is related with persons who are blind or visually impaired. A robust and easy to use indoor navigation solution would be extremely useful, but this would also be particularly difficult to develop, given the special requirements of the system that would have to be more accurate and user friendly than a general solution. This paper presents a contribute to this subject, by proposing a hybrid indoor positioning system adaptable to the surrounding indoor structure, and dealing with different types of signals to increase accuracy. This would permit lower the deployment costs, since it could be done gradually, beginning with the likely existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to get a fairy accuracy up to a high accuracy using visual tags and NFC tags when necessary and possible.",

To commence, we started with the State of Art, studying the CSV theory created by Porter and Kramer, as well as the authors that were either in support of, or against, the strategy. Qualitative Research Method was used, thus focusing the enterprise case study, by analysing media interviews given by the managerial staff of RIR. Content analysis was used to process data and deliver results. The main limitation of the study was the lack of institutional information, due to an absence of responses, to the survey in sufficient time by RIR's managers, subsequently a triangulation of the information acquired could not be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Smart education systems and methodologies are based on the deep integration of information technologies in the educational process. Genuine platforms, concepts and methodologies such as cloud computing systems for collaborative learning, massive courses (MOOC) or flipped classrooms have been incorporated at different educational levels, although the European Higher Education Space allows an easier implementation at university level. Among all the tools belonging to the environment of teaching technologies, wikis have been reported as ideally suited for collaborative learning. Thus, nowadays, several Universities around the world are running Projects and events about the use of wikis in higher education. Therefore, in this paper the authors justify the use of wikis in the higher educational institutions, being focused on a special case: the Wikipedia. Wikipedia presents special characteristics which make it perfect to reach not only the specific learning objectives of a certain particular subject, but also the transversal abilities so demanded today (such as teamwork or social responsibility). Finally, the authors analyze in more depth the experience on the edition of the Wikipedia made by students and professors of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) in the course 2017 and the obtained results are presented.",

Therefore, computer science came to solve this problem by means of a branch of itself which is artificial intelligence and a sub field such as Automatic Learning (A-A). In the present paper we will define a methodology called M3S of IN, in which an appropriate procedure to follow is determined to have the best results in the extraction of data, to obtain greater knowledge and value in the information. This methodology will be based on the ID3 algorithm of decision trees which is based on mathematical concepts such as entropy and information gain within the analysis of the best attributes that can be considered for decision making.",

Within these, it has highlighted among other tools instead of the didactic forums where students among themselves and students and teaching teams could discuss and in general build knowledge within a collaborative context. The data coming from these forums have been analyzed, with different techniques, and have allowed obtaining some very interesting conclusions. However, in recent academic years there is a clear trend of migration of collaborative work that previously occurred in the forums to social networks and mobiles. This poses a problem since these tools are not coordinated by the teaching teams. The present work analyzes this trend and points out the consequences to which it may give rise.",

ICTs, in some countries has influenced and changed Higher Education. However, one of the features of this new methodology using ICTs to work in class, is mixing the traditional learning process with the virtual education in which students can search information on internet related with the topic that are studying during the class. This can motivates students and can result in a more efficient learning process. Many researches, especially with the constructivist paradigm in learning process, emphasize learning as an internal process, carried out by those who learn by themselves, as an active process of knowledge construction, which cannot be acquired passively. That is why the objective of the article is to propose a model for learning environments using technologies that guarantee the motivation and experimentation of a student of Higher Education.",

In this context, Delay Tolerant Networks, where applications need to transmit data in the environment of an intermittent or even non-existent network infrastructure, appear as a complementary and innovative alternative. In Delay Tolerant Networks, applications, in addition to inheriting their benefits, also inherit the challenges of decision-making in message forwarding.

In addition, detecting signs of drowsiness (or better yet, predicting a state of drowsiness is insufficient because it warns that the problem exists (it is a reactive system), but does not understand or resolve it, for this it is necessary to carry out the evaluation of the quality of the sleep and the detection of disturbances or disturbances of sleep, not forgetting that each individual has a circadian rhythm that may not be compatible with the rhythm of their daily activity. However, the rigorous evaluation of sleep quality and the detection of sleep disorders requires a set of clinical equipment that is costly and incompatible with daily use. It is necessary to create a low-cost system that is capable of detecting the possible existence of sleep disorders and classifying each individual relative to their circadian rhythm in a non-intrusive way.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the lowest income population worldwide has considerably increased the demand for credit of low amounts. However, many of the financial entities that provide such amounts do not have granting models that adapt to the specific characteristics of that market. Therefore, the development of granting models that are based on new institutional policies, which integrate quantitative and qualitative information designed exclusively to serve this sector of the population, is relevant. This article presents a methodology for the re-rate of credits from a database corresponding to a financial institution that is dedicated to the placement of resources effectively. For this re-rate a Vector Support Machine with Logistic Kernel was used, which given its flexibility and high classification capacity, allowed generating three granting models, where its results showed the partial relationships that define the granting policies of a given financial entity.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this work is to develop an intrusion detection algorithm in commands sequences. These sequences are based on user behavior applying in several classification techniques. This algorithm allows obtaining a precision in the identification of fraudulent activities. To develop this algorithm, we have worked with a public database called Unix Commands. In addition, the model applies multiple machine learning techniques such as decision tree C4.5, UCS, and Multilayer Neural Network. In this paper we use two forms for data classification, the first form will be to use the entire dataset with the 7 users, but the difference is that the model applies 5 commands or 16 commands. The model identifies the information of a user and the labeled as normal, otherwise, the user is labeled as an intruder (5 commands - 2 classes, 16 commands - 2 classes). The second form uses the dataset by sequential discrimination (discrimination in form of a decision tree). This methodology is used in the multiclass classification called one versus rest (OVR) (5 commands-OVR, 16 commands-OVR). The algorithm has obtained optimal results in the classification and a low false positive rate.",

    "abstract": "Sterilization in hospitals is performed due to the need of attacking and killing bacteria that can be dangerous for patients when intervened with medical instrumentation. In that sense, sterilization autoclaves are used, and controlling both temperature and pressure, bacteria are killed. Nonetheless, in some cases the level of humidity in the internal atmosphere is highly relevant to guarantee the success of the process. This variable is controlled by knowing the steam quality, however, it is not monitored online, but sampling is performed a few times a year, so pertinent adjustments are carried out into the boiler when needed. This periodic maintenance does not guarantee that the process is effective. On the other hand, instruments for monitoring steam quality are expensive, and cannot be afforded by many hospitals. As a result, a cheaper determination of steam quality is carried out by using chemical instruments like test tubes, adding critical errors in the measurements. In this paper a cost-effective measuring and processing method by implementing Internet of Things — IoT-techniques is proposed, based on strangulation calorimeter. All the calculations are performed in a Single Board Computer which is connected to an IoT platform for logging data, supervise in pseudo real time and use statistical tools to inference or predict. As a result, the IoT node can achieve measurement errors up to 0.25% FS, against 5.6% FS of traditional method. Furthermore, the inclusion of pseudo real time monitoring, allows maintenance staff to fix problems even in a predictive way.",

The proposed design was used by a group of professors to design interactive videos in the context of distance education of the Particular Technical University of Loja in Ecuador. The iGuión was evaluated by the teachers where it obtained more than 4 points on 5 in terms of design and ease of use, the 90% of the students participated actively and according to their perception 97% of them, indicate that the interactive videos allowed increase understanding of the content treated.

The problem consist in understand any success in real life saved in a video camera. This process for person recognition, objects, vehicles, danger places, alarms, etc, is the principal goal of this work. The propose is to use ontologies to classify events in recorded videos; for example, people in one place, vehicles in the security zone, etc; generating rules to know what does this event do and trigger this rules at the right time. For this solution we used the relationship between Protégé and Jade generating the agents that use the natural language for the alarms and actions described in the events analysis. The first test was realized in the office with excellent results.",

In this paper, we propose a variation of bat algorithm that self-adapting its parameter settings according to the performance exhibited. Bat algorithm is a relatively modern metaheuristic inspired on the ecolocation behavior of bats that employ echoes to identify the objects in their surrounding area. To evaluate the algorithm performance, we resolve 90 instances of the manufactoring cell design problem taken from Boctor's experiments.

It also has a signal processor FPGA-based which wirelessly receives data from the cerebral cortex using radiofrequency signals, and transmits command infrared signals to the automat. This process allows the user to apply control with no need for physical effort. The methodology of this design focuses on users with some type of limb movement deficiencies or difficulties to use them. Therefore, this process presents a system which enables users to obtain an immediate measure of their attention and meditation. This system helps users, with or without physical limitations, perform activities without using their limbs, either because they are using them for something else or environment limitations.",

Sometimes a new system requires to start up the incorporation of data inherited from those it replaces, this gives rise to a migration project that occurs in parallel to the development of the system. The particular aspect of this environment is the appearance of frequent changes in the new database as a consequence of the evolution in the construction of the system, which forces to adapt the migration. You get a process with the complexities of a migration, but in an unstable environment.

The initial evaluation methods were based on hypothetic-deductive systems, systems in which the same consultant established hypotheses to be solved based on the possible user behavior. These systems have been evolving towards a more active participation of the users making them part of the decisions and allowing a more active participation of the consultants during the test. The evolution of these methodologies is oriented towards the importance of taking into account the behavior of the user during the test session, making the evaluations more dynamic and more participatory. These sessions base their main objective on the results of the test and, therefore, on the pre-established and established behavior during the test. The study presented below is based on working the user experience as a discipline for evaluating user behavior, evoking the influence of emotions through the inclusion of gamification as a discipline to increase / improve experiences. This methodological proposal not only promotes the participatory design of the product, but also promotes user participation in the design of the test. The role of the consultant takes center stage in the face of the constant adaptation required by the new dynamic.",

This method was developed to solve complex optimization problems with variables in real domains. The search for the optimum is done by simulating the equilibrium of phases by means of a simple thermodynamic model widely applied in the chemical process industry. Each variable is treated as the most volatile component of a saturated binary system at a given temperature and pressure. The changes in each element of solution vector are made by using two new movement operators, the bubble point and the dew point. The algorithm has been tested with new mathematical reference functions producing results comparable to those achieved by other procedures.",

This approach is viable since the manifestation of social disorders as distinct phenomena can be related to particular crimes. Thus, with the mapping of social disorders, it is possible to analyze these phenomena, endeavor to understand their dynamics and promote preventative initiatives to combat them. The purpose of this study is to identify which methods and free software cited in the literature are the most highly recommended to carry out collaborative mapping of social disorders with GIS. With this research, it is clear that the use of GIS and mobile devices, aligned to collaborative systems, is a current trend in carrying out collaborative mapping of crimes and disorders.",

The first, where the educator creates a game from scratch, and a second one, where specific game components of an existing game can be configured (edited) by the teacher, abstracting the technical aspects of game development for non-programmer users. Nevertheless, whatever the perspective, the authoring games in an easy way is still a challenge, and even more, there is a lack of works considering educational aspects like Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), students' learning and playing styles, and learning mechanics. This work takes the second perspective and proposes an EGA platform that although embraces both the game and educational domains, puts the emphasis on the educational one. The platform provides educators with a mean for configuring educational games, and so adapt game's educational content to lessons pacing and students' learning needs. This platform is conceived generic enough to serve those educational games that are adapted to interact with it using a given protocol and communication language. In this paper, we present the architecture of the EGA platform, the communication protocol and the Authoring Description Language (ADL). We show the approach with an example of a maths game.",

    "abstract": "How to handle big amounts of data with several structures in an efficient way has been the key point of Big Data. The appearance of Hadoop has been a breakthrough in this field, by allowing to perform an analysis of important volumes of data, without the need of large supercomputers, but through commodity hardware complemented with a set of powerful software tools. The computing advantages provided by this new technology have made it very popular in a massive amount of areas and one of them is health data management. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the state of the art on Hadoop and its ecosystem, as well as to determine how it is possible to use the strength of these technologies, not only to analyze health data but also to reveal hidden information that can explain medical records in a better way. In particular, our work will be focused on determine how, behind veterinary data, there is an influence of the environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) are largely in computer science degrees, related to database discipline. They are an important part of many evaluations. Currently, computer aided assessments are widely used for multiple choice questions, however, they do not have the ability to evaluate a student's knowledge more comprehensively, going beyond right or wrong, which is necessary for the job with the diagram. This research project presents an innovative approach for automatic evaluation of ERD. This approach proposes a solution to the challenge of encouraging students to perfect their solution: seeking, in addition to a response that returns the correct result, a note that approaches the ideal solution. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the student receives instant feedback during the practical diagramming activity, which allows the student to redo his solution for an optimal solution; (2) complete integration of ERD teaching concepts with examples of online diagrams; (3) monitoring the student's activities, i.e. how many examples were executed in each exercise, how many attempts were made. This research is a first step in building a fully assisted environment, for example, with automatic evaluation for ERD teaching, where the professor is freed from the arduous work of correcting diagrams and can perform more relevant pedagogical tasks. The method, based on machine learning techniques, uses structured query language (SQL) metrics extracted from the ERD and experts grade to create the prediction model. The solution can be adapted to other types of diagrams, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).",

This process is aimed at optimizing costs and reducing environmental impact. Currently, different types of computational tools are used, from geo-referenced historical production maps to weather applications. In the case of spraying, it is essential that the producer can have real-time analysis tools in the same place, at the time of performing an application and thus be able to make decisions immediately, always considering the environmental impact. One of the most used tools in the evaluation of the quality of the spray is from the use of water-sensitive cards, which show with a reasonable degree of confidence the calibration state of the pulverizing machines. In this work the use of cell phones is proposed, to help in the process of calibration the spraying machines. For this purpose, the reading process of hydrosensitive cards is automated by means of computer vision technique. These devices allow the producer to immediately verify how a lot has been worked and recalibrate the machinery if necessary. The process followed and some robustness tests of this computational tool are presented.",

    "abstract": "Every individual presents the innate capacity to communicate as a way of being a part of the society and the world around themselves, throughout a child's development they learn how to communicate through the interactions that they establish with others. In the case of a child with severe communication problems, such as a child with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the family and colleague's interactions become considerably restrict and conditioned, which has a negative impact to their emotional, social and/or cognitive development. Thereby, it is fundamental to provide these children with the means to express themselves and to understand the individuals around them. In society, the verified existence of poor adapted material to children with communication disorders, in particular of adapted books in Communication Pictographic Symbols (CPS), and these can be materials that facilitate access to information by these children. The developed investigation is centred at the development of teaching resources, more specifically adapted books with CPS symbols, and their application along with children with ASD. It has had the main goal of verifying if these resources have eased the inclusion of these children in reading activities, as well as if it promotes a further development of the communicative skills alongside these children and their peers, in comparison with the original versions of the same books. The adopted methodology consisted in a qualitative research method, in favour of a case study and action-research approach, in an exploratory and descriptive research method. The investigation was based on fieldwork, which involved two children and the adapted books, developed in the scope of the research. During the research process, there were held practical sessions along with the participating children, where the corresponding fieldnotes were gathered. Subsequently, the special education teachers and class directors, from the respective children, were interviewed. After the data collection, process and analysis we concluded that the adapted books have been structurers and enablers of the communication, when facing the original versions of the books. The children's behaviour and communicational reaction towards the adapted books was of increased participation and dynamics when compared with the reaction towards the original versions of the books, promoting an equal the inclusion of the children with ASD in the reading activities.",

    "abstract": "Panoramic or aerial images can be acquired with some easiness and cover vast tracts of territory to be used in fire detection. The analysis of these images, in particular based on color and threshold indices, can be very interesting computationally when applied in real time systems and collected, for example, through drones or watchtowers. This paper presents a solution designated Color Algorithm for Flame Exposure (CAFE), which significantly improves an existing method (cf. Forest Fire Detection Index - FFDI) in flame detection, based on daylight images, in mixed Mediterranean landscape, containing vegetation, buildings, burning areas, land, etc. The CAFE approach, presented, adds a parameterizable transformation of the image into the Lab color space. This approach was tested in four distinct scenarios, significantly reducing false positives and maintaining an equivalent level of false negatives when compared to the FFDI approach.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the trend of cesarean section rates in a public hospital maternity after the implementation of a Clinical Decision Support System (SADC) for the Robson Classification. The implementation developed a model based on a decision tree that proposes the classification of pregnant women into ten groups based on six basic variables. After implantation, the cesarean section rates was observed between 2016 and 2017. In this period, there were 4,155 deliveries (37.6% cesarean sections). The evolution of cesarean section rates followed a growth trend, as well as the proportion of cesareans section between groups classified as 1 to 4, groups of pregnant women where cesarean sections are very preventable. In the two years it was observed that the SADC had no impact on the reduction of cesarean rates. It was concluded that in health services, work processes need to be articulated with timely decision-making strategies, so that the execution of actions can promote the qualification of services and improve the quality of patient care.",

Faced with such issues, some research have proposed solutions to improve the results in software project management in order to contribute significantly to its success. The objective of this paper is to carry out a study of the context of software project management, identifying the management areas that have been intervened with gamification strategies for software process improvement. To this end, this work proposes a systematic mapping as a research method that facilitates the identification of primary studies to analyze information and classify it based on established research criteria. We found 55 primary studies published between 2011 and 2017, on which we performed an information analysis. This analysis highlights the increase in the number of studies that use gamification as an improvement strategy for software project management processes areas. We classified the selected studies by analyzing the type of research method and the type of publication. This analysis shows that it is still an area of research in development and that it is necessary to continue working on the improvement of software project management processes with the aim of contributing to the success of its results.",

Then applying the fusion to the Value and PAN component through the TWD decimated daubechies (db4) generates a new Value (nval-m). With the nuance and saturation of the MULT image, the inverse HSV-RGB transformation is performed to generate a new multispectral image (N-MULT1). In the second methodology, the algorithm is used: Discrete Wavelet Transform not decimated (TWD not decimated) or Algorithm of À trous, applying the fusion to the Value component and PAN through the TWD not decimated generates a new Value (nval-a) and with the nuance and saturation of the MULT image the inverse HSV-RGB transform is made to generate a new multispectral image (N-MULT2). Finally, the results of the two methods are presented using the ERGAS, RASE and Qu indices for assessment. It is obtained that the à trous method is better spatially and spectrally.",

Recent research has addressed the analysis of HRV in these fields. However, in many occasions, the lack of common databases prevents researchers from validating their results by comparing them with other investigators' findings. This may significantly decrease the quality of the reached conclusions. In an effort to solve this problem, we present PhysioDataBase, a free online repository dedicated to physiologic signals and data exchange. PhysioDataBase allows researchers to create and share with the scientific community physiological signal files, and relevant complementary information, such as sociodemographic data, medication, or clinical history. All this information can be downloaded and used for performing HRV studies.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating research results is not always an easy task. Although it is interesting to compare personal achievements against similar works from other researchers, in many ocassions it is hard to replicate exactly the same conditions, because papers do not reflect all the variables of the context. To mitigate this problem, some standard systems have been created for researchers to unify this step in their works. One example of this is the bxb (beat-by-beat) tool from PhysioNet's PhysioToolkit, developed to compare results in beat detection. Delineation is an important part inside Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic systems, because it is necessary to properly identify waves inside the beats. Besides the position of each wave into the signal, onset and offset positions for a wave are also needed. The more precise these positions are, the better the diagnostic is. But unlike the case of the beat detection, there are no generic tools for delineation evaluation, and papers that deepen in this subject in most cases do not explain clearly how they get their results, or directly asked an expert to supervise the outcome of their systems. Because of this, the main purpose of the present work is to introduce an evaluation tool, named wxw, to assess wave delineation for a computer-aided ECG diagnostic system.",

    "abstract": "The auditing software is an essential tool to the auditor, being a mechanism which helps him/her to achieve its goal, to obtain efficiency, quality and reliability increase on the data analysis and evidence collection. The auditing software can be: Proprietary software (e.g. Caseware IDEA, Microsoft Excel, SPITA) or open source software or free software (e.g. Libre Office, SiAudi, Open Office). The purpose of this paper is to understand which is the most used software in the audit area and, amongst those ones, which are defined as proprietary software or open source software. Moreover, we intend to understand which are the factors that affect or hinder the open source software adoption. To achieve these goals, it was used a survey where it was possible to collect 64 answers. It was verified that the most used software is the proprietary software and that 43% of the respondents are in the first level of open source software assimilation. Additionally, it was verified that the external environment is the macro factor which positively affects the adoption of open source software in auditing.",

    "abstract": "The issue of fraud has recently been more frequent and is a common infraction that can be perpetrated by a single person or arise as a result of collusion, causing asset decrement or theft in organizations. External audits aim to obtain relevant and sufficient evidence that points to high, but not absolute, assurances that the financial statements are free from fraud or material misstatement. On the other hand, the main goal of internal auditing is to identify the risk of fraud by developing strategies that provide the capacity to prevent it and anticipate control needs. Organizations nowadays generate and store more information in electronic format. Because there are large amounts of data, the transactions that are subject of abuse are concealed and harder to detect by traditional means. Thus, analytical methods become increasingly fundamental in identifying and uncovering potential evidence of fraud.",

Thus, the more and the better the companies are prepared to be able to analyze data and make quick decisions, answering their environment, the more easily they will be able to overcome the adversities that arise day after day. In that sense, the use of an Enterprise Resource Planning System reveals itself to be an added value to the company's support, namely for support in the decision making of the members of Administration, through clear and objective quality information, reliable, aggregated and rationally organized, for simplification and automation of operational processes, with reduction of costs and gains in effectiveness and efficiency over the business processes. Thus, through a case study of a car parts trade Company, an analysis to the process of merchandise reception was carried out, by surveying the adopted procedures and the existing control methods over the inherent risks, to propose additional control measures, or reinforcement of the existing ones, with the intent to maintain acceptable levels, for the pursuit of the company's objectives.",

This investigation encompasses the analysis of communicational strategies and the use of the different media tools within the universities in Ecuador as well as the analysis of which media are preferred by the so-called millennials or Generation Y (target population). The study had 2 phases. Phase 1 was focused in identify the habits of media use of our target population. To accomplish this task, we gathered data from a survey of 8,000 college students as well as official information sources. Phase 2 was aimed to identify which digital communicational strategies are used in the different universities of Ecuador. For Phase two we used an actual metric tool known as fan page karma. The results of our study allowed us to identify and contrast the different social media the millennials prefer versus those utilized by the universities of Ecuador. The study also determined which variables were linked to the management of such social media by the different universities.",

This work seeks to propose, through a functional and technical analysis, an electronic commerce platform of tourism products and services that allows both the traditional commercialization of products and, in parallel, the negotiation in (almost) real time of tourism products and services, idealized by customers themselves, to which operators can reply via the platform itself.",

Starting from a sample of small Portuguese companies for a period from 2007 up to 2014 we analyze if the voluntary adoption of audit reduces the earnings management and therefore increases the earnings quality. The small companies can manipulate the earnings for example for reducing the income taxes to pay or to finance as also reducing the interest rate of those finance. The small companies are an important part of businesses, either in terms of employees and number. The voluntary audit is not very studied subject. The results suggest that the voluntary adoption of audit do not reduce the earnings management, and thus do not increase the earnings quality. These results may be due to the fact these companies are not visible and therefore the audit firms could not allocate as much resources to the audit.",

In takes as reference for the analysis and interpretation the statistics of exhibition and consumption of audiovisual productions of Latin American in the aforementioned platform in the months of April and May of 2017. Latin American production consolidates at a slow pace within of a world-wide audiovisual in which they stand out: Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Chile. In Ecuador, in spite of the investment that the Government of the Citizen Revolution (2007-2017) did in the audiovisual sector its presence is almost invisible in the platform of study. The average growth rates of the national cinematographic projects beneficiaries of the Cinematographic Development Fund and projects executed with the same fund between 2007 and 2016 are -11% and -8%, which shows that the subsidy encouraged the production, but not mass visualization in the context of study. In short, there is substantial Ecuadorian production, but these titles do not form the offer of Netflix.",

When talking about such an emergent and promising area as smart cities, it is important to understand the relationship between them and smart tourism, especially in small and medium-sized inland cities. The Portuguese Smart Cities Network comprises 46 Municipalities spread across the national territory. In this network, there are visibly fewer cities located inland. It is clear that the increasing tourist interest in Portugal is mainly targeted at big cities. It was this evidence that led to the present study, which focuses on determining whether the inland cities considered to be smart cities may be an alternative to this tourist flow. In order to answer this and other questions, a survey was conducted and the results are presented in this study.",

For this purpose, the two national newspapers with the longest trajectory in the spatial context analyzed, El Comercio and El Telégrafo, were selected. In order to determine the behavior that the Ecuadorian press has adopted facing these new digital media, the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the two newspapers chosen for this research were analyzed. Additionally, interviews made to the main representatives of these journals and the results of a survey made to 389 people were studied. Based on the data obtained, it is evident that, despite the large benefits that social networks present, the media analyzed do not take full advantage of the resources that these tools offer to digital journalism. Interactivity with users, such as the undeniable utility of social media, is unequal in the two newspapers studied, with a higher participation rate in El Comercio. Finally, Ecuadorian newspapers still use social networks more as an information repository than as real-time content spreading tools.",

However, it also represents a compositional feature hardly investigated by the Academy, despite the functional value it has developed over the last two decades in the digital scenario. Therefore, this study is based on the direct observation of the para textual publications of the Ecuadorian cyber media, El Comercio and El Universo, and their informational development through the virtual interaction network Facebook. For this purpose, the pragmatic characteristics and hypermedia components derived from the cyber news headlines were examined for 184 days to determine the degree of compliance with the formal standardization norms of the Spanish language and the use of the multidimensional attributes of the semantic network.",

    "abstract": "In the new scenario of digital communication, community radio assumes the challenge of media convergence that transforms one of its main characteristics, unisensoriality. In this way, the present article intends to analyze in an individual and comparative way the use of the audiovisual tools offered by the Facebook platform by the Community Radio of Ecuador and Peru. With this objective, a mixed methodology is proposed that uses the descriptive method through the quantification and qualification of the audiovisual aspects implemented by community radios. Based on this analysis, it is observed that although the media analyzed use audiovisual tools, not all of them present an adequate communication management of them, as well as media that do not take advantage of the audiovisual potential offered by Facebook. With this, it is concluded that the transition from analogue community media to the virtual world still requires a great work of transformation towards multimedia and the understanding of the characteristics of social networks and digital communication.",

Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATT) are examples of tools used for this purpose, but many other software programs are used to support audits. Considering this growing use of computer tools to support auditing, this study aims to identify the most used tools in the context of the internal audit in Portuguese companies, and to evaluate the factors that may influence the use of those tools. This research, through an inquiry, concludes that internal auditors mostly use generic rather than specific tools in their audit work. The use of specific computer tools to support auditing is influenced by the size of the workplace, more specifically by the size of the audit department. Other factors that also influence the use of these computerized techniques are the experience in auditing and the existence of a certified internal auditor in the workplace.",

Therefore, it is essential to carry out research on internal control in ERP contexts so that control measures may accompany the rapid development of those systems and the increase of their complexity so that the risks associated to their use may be reduced. This paper presents a bibliometric study on internal control in ERP systems and concludes that research on this topic is still scarce. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the level of research maturity is still very low because the number of publications regarding this subject is extremely small when compared to the number of publications in each of the core topics (internal control and ERP) individually.",

In a sample of 970 unlisted companies, we find evidence of a negative relationship between the audit and the level of earnings management. We also demonstrate that during the period of time in which the financial support occurred, there was mitigation in the relationship between the level of earnings management and audit.",

The results show a positive perception by the respondents about the contribution of the internal audit to control the excessive indebtedness. This research provides information that may be useful to the municipalities, in their economic and financial decision-making.

Hence this research evaluates the contribution of internal audit to organization's management and identifies the organizational dynamics which influence that contribution using a sample of management entities of 25 large Portuguese companies. Results reveal an effective contribution of internal audit to organization's management and show as enhancers of this contribution: the involvement of organization in internal audit, internal audit and management interaction and independence granted to internal audit. Top managers must ensure a strategic alignment between management and internal audit to reflect benefits of this activity in decision-making process and to gain competitive advantages.",

    "abstract": "In today's global society, where everything flows like liquid through the digital network and its noise becomes obvious, attention has become the most searched item by message senders. “To be” does not just involve “being” and presenting oneself, or arrives by reaching visibility. What is cardinal, what is essential, is located in the field of perception. That is, “to be perceived” is what is substantial. And, besides, it should be considered that perception would turn vacuous and would dilute itself in the instant's own dimension that rules the essence of the digital society, unless it is capable to implicate the receiver in a singularized relationship in accordance with continuity, while this is sustained by the latter devoting its time. This way, the binomial attention-time necessarily becomes indissoluble. This new approach to the communicative connection between sender-receiver has triggered an important acceleration of the expansive process of content reformulation, the formats encapsulating them, and the media circulating them. Just arriving plays the role of what is contingent. What is nuclear is to “remain,” sustaining that singular, individualized dialogue that is inherent to the collectivization of the digital presence due to the successive incorporation of communicative action-reaction in the melting pot of incessant feedback. The struggle between senders to reach their “desired” receivers - united under the concept of public - now does not have the final purpose of “arriving,” reaching them, and exposing themselves to them. Now, it is all about capturing their attention and withholding it to receive retribution from them in time, which is possible to be monetized. What is difficult is to capture attention in the more and more complex digital world. That is why information and communication technologies direct their development to a more exhaustive knowledge of the “digital subject”, where the so-called “big data” plays an essential role to be able to predict and anticipate certain individual behaviours and have a positive bearing on “capturing” their attention and generating a higher degree of engagement. This is the foundation of the emerging content marketing.",

    "abstract": "Several theorists and researchers consider that today we live in an era called “late capitalism”, other theorists call it the “world-culture” where the means of production and the capitalism of information have been left behind. This new capitalism, expressed in advanced and developing economies, focused on the Internet and the media as a means of reproduction and capital accumulation. Without a doubt, the content of the media that reflects the global culture on the Internet has changed consumer behavior. A principle that controls this scenario is the homogenization of the consumer. It has become evident that the creators of culture of the countries of the northern hemisphere have identified the criteria of globalism to expand communication, culture and the content of the media. On the other hand, we oppose coining the term capitalism of information, when the following data show that the use of the internet focuses on the use of technological platforms, for recreational and leisure purposes. The following article, search can give an idea of cultural capitalism and how the concepts of cultural industry, are still valid.",

The data used to construct the independent variable location index; as well as the dependent variables, differences in productivity (PROD), endowment of factors (DF), economies of scale (ESC), intensity of intermediate goods (IBI) come from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC), National Economic Census (CENEC) corresponding to the III Census of Manufacturing and Mining and II of Commerce and Services, carried out in the year 1980; and III National Economic Census and are based on the theories of international trade and localization. The results obtained in the econometric model indicate that the factor that influences the location of Ecuadorian industries is the average business size - economies of scale - that is adjusted to what is proposed by the new economic geography (NGE).",

All this with Article 20 of the Spanish Constitution and the debate on the limits of the freedom of expression in the background, in the midst of a cross-match between the so-called constitutionalist and independence political parties, between appeals to the Central Electoral Board (JEC) and accusations about manipulation by different television channels. In this context, the role of electoral debates in television becomes especially important, as a tool for achieving a better-formed public opinion, increasing the quality of public debate-citizen- and by extension the improvement of participation and democratic quality. The research presented here analyzes, in particular, the advertising and actions of self-promotion issued by the television operators (TVE, La Sexta and TV3) that organized debates among the candidates of the main political parties that attended the mentioned elections, in order to know the frame of reference and informative treatment offered by this TV's about the same event in function of three variables: the public or private nature of the medium, the territorial scope of them and the editorial line.",

As there is no certifiable standard for integrated management systems, this study seeks to measure the sensitivity of companies to a single certifiable standard for integrated quality and environment and safety management systems (SIGQAS). An empirical study, considering an exploratory analysis based on a survey methodology applied in industrial companies of the central region of Portugal, has been conducted, with, at least, the certified Quality Management System. According to the data analyses, a large number of companies (59%) consider that the existence of a single certifiable standard for SIGQAS would facilitate their implementation. However, the differences between opinions, are not statistically significant, wherefore the need for an integrative standard, is not clearly taking into account by the companies. On the other hand, it is evident to companies that consider the existence of the only certifiable standard, their motivation for the certification of SIGQAS. In view of this situation, is clear the challenge that auditing faces as monitoring function, while an integrated part of the system, which can also contribute to the resources optimization and continuous improvement. However, it is important to continue the research, in particular as regards the extension of the sample.",

In reality, this phase is vital to ensure the timeliness, adaptability and quality of the information available to end users. However, despite the recognized importance attributed to the optimization of ETL, it is rare to find Information Technology (IT) teams that develop metrics and indicators that allow the factual monitoring of their performance. In line with the saying “the shoemaker's son always goes barefoot”, those responsible for the development of ETL processes often base their optimization exclusively on previous experiences and professional sensitivity. In this context, the objective of this article is to study the concept of BI for BI, analyze its added value in the optimization of ETL processes and indicate possible monitoring indicators.",

Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATTs) have an important part in this process, since those methodologies can involve sophisticated statistical analysis and can be time consuming. For audit time series, CaseWare IDEA can be used to compute point forecasts, meaning that a single value is produced for each forecast. Even though the practical usefulness of this type of forecast is undisputed, the uncertainty in the forecasts is not expressed. To overcome this issue, a point forecast should be complemented with its prediction intervals. The R Project software is an interesting statistical tool to consider for this purpose, as it provides quick accurate analysis in a reproducible way. This paper describes how prediction intervals based on regression analysis can be computed in R Project software, for audit series with trend and/or seasonality.",

As far as the methodology was concerned, an inquiry was drawn up and the results obtained using descriptive statistics were analyzed. The conclusions pointed to the need to focus on the training of human resources and the relevance that the internal audit may have in meeting the requirements of the measures set forth in the new General Regulation on Data Protection.

For this, the use of mathematical models based on specialized software (Matlab), determines the characteristics of the iris establishing criteria or patterns to determine the existence or not of Alzheimer's. For this we have: i) The Fourier Transform to normalize the image; ii) The Hough Transform to locate circles in an image. In addition some learning methods based on three multi-layer classifiers were used: ZeroR, Naïve Bayes and Multi-layer Perceptron. Finally, to distinguish between the different types of pathologies, several samples must be used and well identified, that is, the data must be consistent and with a good resolution to avoid influencing the results.",
