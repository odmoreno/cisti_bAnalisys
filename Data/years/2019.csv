This evolution means that this mobile device almost loses its main functions of making calls and sending messages, and also acquire the functions of a computer with a low processing capacity. Much of the addition of these new features to the mobile phone was the responsibility of the telecommunications companies, as people, when acquiring a better mobile phone, make more use of mobile data. This responsibility is shared with smartphone development companies and applications to be installed on them. With these new devices on the market, and with the variety of applications available, people have a tendency to want to acquire them, since quite easily, they can perform some functions that they previously only had with a computer. This study shows the influence that the mobile phone has on people's daily lives, namely if they can make people become dependent on it, without realizing it. Thus, an exploratory study with a quantitative methodology was carried out through the application of questionnaires, and it was verified that people use the smartphone, mainly to facilitate their daily tasks.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760845","mobile phone;smartphone usage;technological stress;addiction;personal relationships","Mobile handsets;Instruments;Internet;Stress;Companies;Information systems;3G mobile communication","","1","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the groups identified, the next step is to find all the grammatical periods, which will be analyzed so that groups capable of describing actions and formulas can be located and assembled. Since the text, in the semantic sense, is a seam or an interlacing of words that forms a sense of information that does not obey a rule, a sequence or an algorithm of thought, it becomes necessary to standardize the description of the characteristics of the theme. In this process step, with the rules standardized and reorganized according to the algorithm, any article will be treated as if it were a computational structure, since this is one of the means to know what actions or functions the article describes, and that will be rewritten in the schema: object, property, modules and functions.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760772","Algorithm;Text;Object;Feature;Function","Nanoelectromechanical systems;Information systems;Semantics","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information and Communication Technology tools combined with data analysis techniques can be used to make these Open Data understandable to anyone interested, machine-readable, reusable, and a source for improved decision support, innovation, accountability and efficiency. This paper analyzes some Open Data initiatives within the Brazilian Government in order to verify if they meet the requirements of the Open Data definition. The results indicated that those requirements were all almost fulfilled, but there are still challenges to be overcome, such as greater update frequency, better license-free specification, and effective availability of all data which can be open to citizens. These results can help governments to identify the gaps that need to be addressed and make Open Data initiatives more effective.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760592","open data;open government data;transparency;data analysis","Government;Portals;Economics;Technological innovation;Collaboration;Licenses;Standards","","4","","32","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Curiously, television, in terms of audience, is resisting with difficulties the push of the Internet and maintains the leadership in quantity of audience, but it is necessary to measure the virtual multi-user impact if you include advertising inputs. The debate is how to measure, in a technically adequate and efficient way, the audiences. The progressive penetration of the HbbTV (Hybrid broadcast broadband Television) standard in homes breaks the traditional patterns of audience measurement. It supposes the union between the Internet and audio-visual, so that, in interactive contents, the viewer can derive towards online contents. This raises certain situations, such as the control of the duration of the visit to an advertisement, and new decisions on the control of users. It can be considered a single visit, or segment the audio-visual metrics of the Internet. In this quantitative research the data of a survey on HbbTV in Spain is analyzed. Professionals of the sector are questioned about the way forward to some of these debates. It is concluded that the data obtained by visit of multi-users in virtual environments must be integrated, but that the minutes of follow-up through the Internet must be determined according to the rules of minutes per hour of television advertlsing.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760796","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Internet;Measurement;Broadband communication;Advertising;Standards;Cable TV","","","","20","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The article discusses the design of a software application designed to be installed on smartphones and to be used by only one hand. Through the design of an ergonomic interface, according to the anatomy of the human hand, new forms of interaction and the use of this type of devices were studied. The study presented in this paper seeks to identify if the adaptation of people at the time of interaction is due to the dimensions of the device or if that interaction is also constrained because of design issues. Some applications present an inadequate interface, which has not evolved and does not introduce new methods of interaction for promoting interactions that require the use of only one hand. The article explores synergies between Interaction Design, Human and Ergonomic Factors, and Information Architecture. The methodology chosen for the development of this project was the Agile Design Science Research (ADSR) applied to a specific case study. The proposed solution uses service design thinking techniques with context-awareness mechanisms applied to the healthcare sector. In the context of the case study, the research challenges focus mainly on monitoring the impact of the proposed solution on streamlining the interaction of the customer-segment with the customer care service provider in the healthcare institution, using mobile devices. Such dematerialization of processes transfers customer interaction to new channels, reducing the need to travel to the institution for simple administrative processes. The value proposal, therefore, focuses on a set of services for self-management of the information necessary for the client to be able to interact more comfortably with the customer service provider in the healthcare institution.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760687","interaction design;service design;smartphone interface;context-awareness;user experience","Europe;Software;Medical services;Monitoring;User experience;Information systems","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BI platforms are a major asset for any enterprise, as they have multiple benefits that become a competitive advantage. It is known that BI implementation costs are one of the top factors for the non BI spread over Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Open source BI platforms provide most of the functionalities available in commercial solutions without increasing costs for organizations. Another factor also known to keep BI aside from SMEs: the complexity of implementation. This paper intends to answer the question that arises when the SME decides to move forward: can we implement a BI system? How complex will it be? It is conducted a case study where a prototype implementation of Pentaho BI platform takes place using a real case and data. The aim is to verify the complexity level of this implementation process and if it is within reach of an SME. The overall conclusion is that even though the process is not that complex, it should be managed by someone with knowledge in this area, either from the organization or from external.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760740","business inteligence;open source;SMEs;Pentaho","Tools;Business intelligence;Companies;Data mining;Decision making","","5","","14","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the new business model, especially, the one which implies access paid to cultural content, namely music, movies, TV series, images and news, does not still show a great success. In order to understand how the consumers of the generations X and Y (Millennials), from countries with unfavorable economic conditions, known as PIIGS, have adhered to the reality of online consumption of cultural content. The results from the Flash Eurobarometer 437: “Internet users' preferences for online accessing content” show the existence of three groups of consumers, and only one of them has a propensity to access paid content. Thus, by knowing the profiles of these three groups of consumers, it is possible to direct marketing campaigns tailored to each of them and to evaluate possible ways to convert consumers that only use of free services into consumers of paid services.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760841","Internet;streaming;music;movies;online cultural contents","Cultural differences;Internet;Sociology;TV;Media;Companies","","","","20","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We aim to contribute to the equilibrium between strong controls and maintain flexible the way people operate on an organization. The drive of this paper is to introduce a compatibility risk matrix to establish a measure of a specific GDPR data protection principle - Purpose Limitation- in accordance with the best practices. This will allow an organization to add new services and verity if it maintains the compliance with GDPR with a minima efforts.

This happens due to deficiencies in the fiber (attenuation, dispersion, conversion). Therefore, we can say that the distance a signal can travel without losing or corrupting information is limited. It is necessary to regenerate the signals periodically using regenerators. Given an optical network, the regenerator location problem tries to install a subset of regenerators with the minimum possible cost, in a way that each pair of nodes can communicate with each other. In this paper bio-inspired algorithms are used to solve this problem. Results obtained using 480 different instances prove their efficiency in solving the regenerator location problem.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760761","Evolutionary Algorithms;Optimisation;Regenerator Location Problem;Computer Networks","Optical fiber networks;Computer science;Information systems;Repeaters;Signal resolution;Optical fiber dispersion","","1","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that, we collected the top-20 results retrieved by Google to 23,779 queries from 20 topics and used several readability metrics. The results of the analysis showed that the content from organizations (like colleges and other institutions) and health-related content have lower readability values. Categories Games and Home are on the opposite side. For the categories identified as having less readability, tools can be developed that help the user understand their content. We also found that top-ranked pages have higher values of readability.

Effectiveness is measured in terms of the number and severity of defects found. The software under test is a set of Java web applications. The testing process was carried out by two testers within the organization. Our results show that automated testing needs a higher initial effort, mainly caused by the creation of the scripts, but this cost can be amortized in time as automated tests are executed multiple times for regression testing.

Real-time monitoring includes vital signs monitoring equipment and the approximate location within and shape of the facilities, which will allow monitoring technicians at Private Social Solidarity Institutions (IPSS) to verify in real time the physical condition of their users. This system intends to make a significant leap in the use of ubiquitous and pervasive, nonintrusive computing, in the support of entities related to the Social Protection sector. In this way, the monitoring and followup of the users will be carried out by a specialized technician who can at any moment initiate a process of search and rescue of some users who may be in danger, that leaves the protection zone confined to IPSS, that loses vital signs, or is facing any other adverse event that could compromise their safety and, in the limit, their own life.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760634","Internet of Things;Orientation Systems;Support Technologies;Intelligent Systems;Ubiquitous Systems","Monitoring;Real-time systems;Temperature sensors;Senior citizens;Internet of Things;Sensor systems","","","","17","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transparency index of each of the portals evaluated was obtained. The average score, on a maximum scale of one hundred, is 39 for the portals of municipal governments and 64 for provincial governments. It seems that there is an influence between the region of the country to which the government belongs and the transparency index obtained, governments of the Sierra region have slightly higher scores. The degree of compliance with the indicators evaluated seems to be independent of the complexity of the information required in it, so that each government evaluated obtains very close scores in each group.

With this, it is concluded that, because it is an accident with multiple influencing factors, it must be combated by multiple agentes. Nongovernmental organizations in partnership with municipalities and religious institutions should inform the elderly population of the fall, its causes and consequences. The Federal Government together with the Ministry of Health must carry out a plan of continuing education activities for health professionals about falls in the elderly and, finally, partnerships between large media and university centers to disseminate to the lay population the real impacts of the fall and its consequences.

Resources for financing originate in the public or private sector. Most research projects in HEI are funded by public funds that are increasingly directed towards the development of innovation according to specific policy guidelines. Funded research involves distributing a considerable amount of money, which can lead HEI to desirable behavior by the funder and align their objectives with research priorities that ensure greater reward. In this paper, the aim is to analyze public funding, since it guarantees the subsistence of researchers and the means to conduct research in HEI, providing an overview of their evolution and current state in particular with regard to the nature and dynamics of funding schemes for research, and how these schemes contribute to their results. To achieve the objectives, a review exploratory of the literature on research funding was carried out in order to investigate its state of the art. The university's research environment has undergone profound changes as well as research funding systems.

However, software process improvement (SPI) initiatives are complex because search to ameliorate the conditions and behavior of the professionals involved in software development. For this reason, indicators about change resistance in SPI initiatives show that underestimating the complexity of a change process and its consequent resistance to change weakens the results of such improvement. Therefore, there is a growing search of strategies for reduce the change resistance and as a result of this search, gamification is being used in this context because it helps to modify and influence the behavior of people and thus achieve the proposed goals. Motivated by the gamification benefits, in this article we propose a classification of the models of change resistance found in the literature looking to define a strategy that facilitate SPI initiatives implementation. Such classification proposal will be an input for the gamification use to decrease change resistance common causes in SPI initiatives.

Our objective was to evaluate this approach and compare the applicability of the previous findings. We conducted the first replication of the controlled experiment in 2015, and subsequently conducted two differentiated replications in 2018. We evaluated the responses of 33 participants in terms of quality, coverage, relevance and efficiency and discussed insights regarding the impact of context factors. Participants were divided into treatment (security requirements templates) and control groups (no templates). Our findings support some previous results: treatment group performed significantly better than the control group in terms of the coverage of the identified security requirements. Besides, the requirements elicitation process performed significantly better in relevance and efficiency metrics in two of the three replications. Security requirements templates supported participants to identify a core set of the security requirements and participants were favorable towards the use of templates in identifying security requirements.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760631","security requirements;requirements engineering;software engineering;replication;empirical study","Security;Software systems;Task analysis;Object recognition;Measurement;Requirements engineering","","2","","16","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose and compare approaches to compute the degree of association of a concept to lay and medico-scientific terminology. We use different thesauri for this purpose and use the cosine similarity to measure the closeness of concepts with subsets of those thesauri. The evaluation of our approaches uses an existing glossary containing concepts in both terminologies in English and Portuguese and a and a set of queries submitted by users and classified by health professionals as lay or medical-scientific.

The presented strategy uses human-like gait with varying parameters such as step length and walking speed in order to adapt the robot's locomotion to different foot-floor friction coefficients. The gait parameters are chosen in order to minimize the probability of slipping, leading to an undesired fall. This choice of gait parameters is based on the analysis of the ground reaction forces and human behavior. Also, gait adaptation is further improved in order to follow a desired ZMP trajectory, through the use of a controller that offsets the hip and ankle joint angles. The novelty of this work lies on the fact that machine learning techniques are used to adapt the gait parameters and joint corrections to make the robot more resistant to both slipping and external disturbances.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760942","ZMP;Human Gait;Slippery Floors;Friction Coefficient;Intelligent controller","Friction;Legged locomotion;Trajectory;Floors;Humanoid robots;Foot","","1","","31","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the collection of climate and biodiversity data presents significant challenges. This work performs a survey of the main quality problems identified in the bioclimatic data collection process. The methodological procedure consisted in identifying the problems, assigning the data quality dimension affected, and suggestions for possible solutions to the problems. The results of this survey showed that ambiguous methodological procedures during the data gathering and human interference are important factors for data quality impairment and the information obtained from these data.

Its development must be linked to the use of regulations that imply “Must be“ and its application must be decided in accordance with the legal principles, which compel the doctors and technicians to be accountable. The incessant development of medical technology, in its application in telemedicine, can lead to the vulnerability of ethical principles, and with it, the damage and misinterpretation of Medical Law.

Since some cloud providers offer free services for educational purposes, this article presents partial results from an empirical study that explores the tools and services of the Google Cloud Platform for education in a b-learning tutorial program.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760707","Cloud computing;education;information and communication technologies;higher education institutions","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Education;Google;Software as a service;NIST","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Originally, sensor nodes were connected in closed networks, where they only collected data and sent them to a central server to be processed. However, with the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution and the era of Cyber-Physical Systems, Wireless Sensors Networks are employed in a large catalogue of applications, many of them critical: traceability, ambient intelligence, biological signal control, etc. At the beginning, simple encryption techniques were enough, but as more sophisticated applications are proposed, protection schemes turn also more complex. In particular, schemes based on digital signatures, hash functions and Public Key Infrastructures are extensively implemented. Nevertheless, all these solutions present a very important problem: nodes must store a secret key. As future systems will be unmanaged and be deployed in remote places without surveillance, the use of ROM memories where keys are stored in a permanent way is a critical risk. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new scheme for signature delegation in WSN, based on magnetic Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). PUF take advantage of any physical properties to build private keys which are inaccessible and impossible to replicable; what added to the intrinsic complexity magnetic phenomena will enable us to define an inviolable signature scheme. A simulation scenario is also defined to validate the usability and performance of the proposed framework.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760800","Wireless Sensor Networks;Physical Unclonable Functions;Chaotic resonators;Digital signature;Automatic key generators","Wireless sensor networks;Resonant frequency;Generators;Magnetic fields;Permeability","","1","","16","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can be argued that digital literacy is a set of skills associated with the use of ICT that each individual must develop in order to function in a computerized society. The purpose of this research is to describe the experiences, needs and learning styles of older adults (over 60) who participated in Digital Literacy Workshops - both face-to-face and mixed. This study had the participation of 98 adults aged 60 or over, including 72 women (68.5 ± 6.9) and 26 men (73.3 ± 7.4).

On the other hand, the learning style most adopted by older adults is multimodal (69%), which means that they process information in more than one way.

This has resulted in the prevalence of redundant users data on different services. To protect and regulate access by users to these services identity management systems (IdMs)are put in place. IdMs uses frameworks and standards e.g SAML, OAuth and Shibboleth to manage digital identities of users for identification and authentication process for a service provider. However, current IdMs have not been able to address privacy issues (unauthorised and fine-grained access)that relate to protecting users identity and private data on web services. Many implementations of these frameworks are only concerned with the identification and authentication process of users but not authorisation. They mostly give full control of users digital identities and data to identity and service providers with less or no users participation. This results in a less privacy enhanced solutions that manage users available data in the electronic space. This article proposes a user-centred mandate representation system that empowers resource owners to take full of their digital data; determine and delegate access rights using their mobile phone. Thereby giving users autonomous powers on their resources to grant access to authenticated entities at their will. Our solution is based on the OpenID Connect framework for authorisation service. To evaluate the proposal, we've compared it with some related works and the privacy requirements yardstick outlined in GDPR regulation [1] and [2]. Compared to other systems that use OAuth 2.0 or SAML our solution uses an additional layer of security, where data owner assumes full control over the disclosure of their identity data through an assertion issued from their mobile phones to authorisation server (AS), which in turn issues an access token. This would enable data owners to assert the authenticity of a request, while service providers and requestors also benefit from the correctness and freshness of identity data disclosed to them.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760690","Privacy;User-centred;Mandate representation","Data privacy;Privacy;Identity management systems;Authorization;Authentication;Web services","","6","","30","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform.

The information acquired is always stored in digital media, organized in a group with indexing access in any order, which allows them to be related to indexer types of another group in digital media. The methodology is based on the generation of a unique indexing in such a way that the information is ordered hierarchically. Once a single indexing is made into a digital media, the algorithm can describe the order in which the information should be displayed or worked. The result is the availability of the information in a more optimized time in relation to a conventional logic, and always meeting the project objective. The choice of one of the types of heuristics, the indexing ordering and the crossing between digital media leads to the obtaining of a greater or lesser time in the access to the information and in its treatment, where normally the lack of this indexation is cause of delay in access or even of the absence of some data.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760861","Heuristic algorithm;Alternative logic;Indexing","Indexing;Media;Heuristic algorithms;Presses;Encoding;Optimization","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterized by various sources of pollution that can lead to unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, laboratory activities, especially in the case of experiments using thermography, require the supervision of several parameters. The proliferation of the Internet of Things paradigm (IoT) shows great potential for the creation of automatic solutions for monitoring indoor environments. In general, people spend about 90% of their time inside buildings so it is significant to use realtime monitoring systems in order to identify bad ambient conditions. The timely detection of poor ambient conditions allows you to plan interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. This paper aims to present a laboratory environment conditions supervision solution based on IoT architecture called iLabM+. The solution is composed of prototype hardware for the collection of the data environment and a Web portal for data consulting and analysis.

On the other hand, the ageing of the global population presents a great opportunity for the development of solutions for ambient assisted living. The majority of existing air quality monitoring systems on the market are expensive, do not have direct forms of communication with the user, do not use social networks to share collected data and do not offer support for automated robots. This article presents iAirBot a standalone robot capable of monitoring indoor air quality. A gas sensor and a “Sun Spot” sensor network are used for monitoring air quality. Other sensors can be added to monitor specific pollutants. The results reveal not only that this automated mobile air monitoring solution is feasible as well as that indoor air quality may in some cases be very different from what would be expected. The proposed system can provide an effective form of interaction with the user. The authors believe that in the near future the company's robots will have APIs for data sharing in social networks as well as offer interconnection with indoor monitoring systems.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760641","air quality;ambient assisted living;smart city;smart home;wireless sensor networks","Monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Logic gates;Air quality;Software;Sun","","6","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a clear evidence that these internal disparities can lead to the continued marginalization of people and regions “disconnected” from global information networks, which support the modern economy and causing strong inequalities. By other side, data available about the ICT use are normally from central regions and not Less Favoured Regions.

However, IoT devices lack a good security layer due to lack of resources: small memory, processor and/or battery. Consequently, new potential attacks and security problems have arisen. In order to detect and mitigate these security problems Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)can be used, However, abnormal traffic must be distinguished from normal IoT patterns. In this article, a study was done on characterization of traffic signatures of two typical IoT application protocols - MQTT and MQTTS - with the objective of generating and collecting IP flows of said traffic. An IoT application scenario was simulated and using the traffic collected, an analysis of MQTT and MQTTS flows were elaborated to identify flow-based signatures that could be used to identify the network traffic of IoT application protocols.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760849","Cibersecurity;flow monitoring;network intrusion detection;Internet of Things;MQTT;MQTTS","Internet of Things;Protocols;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Cryptography;Open systems","","2","","12","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The way of teaching as well as the learning process are not the same as in older times, so we think that it is important to analyse the phenomenon. There are several advantages to the use of technology, and the future heralds even greater evolution. The effect of technologies on teaching has been very significant and even university professors resort to the usage of websites or other technological tools. The concept of innovation is not only associated to information and communication technologies, but also to the process and innovative supply of methods of access to knowledge. Therefore, associating innovation to the teaching of languages is something completely acceptable, since the usage of technological resources is a form of innovating. Because the final objective is to find a coherent response that indicates what is currently happening in the world of education concerning languages, primary data was obtained via a total of eleven interviews answered by young language students and professors. With this study, we conclude that technologies will continue to have an impact on the future of teaching. There is a general consensus concerning the relevance of obtaining better academic results. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that learning becomes more facilitated with technology because there is easier access to information.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760619","MALL;Línguas L2;TELL;Adaptive Learning;Flipped Learning;e-learning","Adaptive learning;Electronic learning;YouTube;Technological innovation;Information systems;Tools","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)are an example of one of these technologies with recognized results because that seems to contribute to the acquisition and mastery of digital competences in the context of the realization of the teaching-learning process supported by the networks. It is in these networks that all the participants in the educational process interact and collaborate with all, cultivate connections, debate the themes, present their criticisms, update their knowledge, acquire new skills, make decisions, but generically develop as members of a connectivist community. Based on these assumptions, in this research we intend to make a review of the literature to identify the aspects that, in detriment of regular education, to encourage the teachers to adopt the MOOC as technology for their professional development and to carry out the process of teaching and learning. Thus, through an exploratory research, characterized as documentary, we use the main sources of information, in this case scientific articles published on the subject to understand the relevance and contribution of the MOOC in an educational universe supported by technologies. In general, the results, although preliminary because of temporal limitations issues in accompanying the rapid evolution of the scientific production of knowledge, suggest that on the one hand the teachers opt for MOOC education for the ease of distance learning; on the other hand, adopt the MOOCs for the acquisition of digital skills oriented to the new challenges.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760597","digital skills;educational institutions;MOOC;teachers;technological modernization","Collaboration;Cultural differences;Information and communication technology;Reflection;Technological innovation;Training","","1","","37","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, mouse usage requires movement control, hand posture and finger positioning, as well as, precision clicks for different functions (one click, two clicks, drag and click.) This training is often done in real interaction situations, that could led to inefficiency of use the digital environments and also user's frustration and discouragement.

Many pieces of research in the field of psychology, neuropsychology and cognitive neurosciences, have detailed the way in which the extraction of such information is carried out, even proposing models of the functioning of visual attention. From these models, computer scientists have proposed computational variants, which imitate human visual attention. This field of research is known as saliency detection on images. In this paper, a new and simple approach for detecting visual saliencies based on Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding is presented. Our method first subdivides the image into full overlapped patches and runs a dictionary learning over them for obtaining its sparse representation. Then, by analyzing the sparse coding matrix, we compute how many image patches a dictionary atom affects in order to classify them as frequent or rare. Then, we calculate the saliency map of the image according to the composition of the image patches, i.e. an image patch is considered salient if it is mainly composed of rare atoms, an atom is rare whether it affects a few patches. Numerical results validate our method.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760988","saliency detection;dictionary learning;sparse coding","Dictionaries;Machine learning;Encoding;Visualization;Saliency detection;Computational modeling;Sparse matrices","","2","","24","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Treatment of such mental disorders involves exposure therapy, which is usually conducted on a gradual and systematic basis, allowing modifications in the therapeutic setting with different exposure sessions. To meet these conditions, the therapist needs to evaluate the patient's responses in the previous sessions to define the content of the subsequent sessions. Therefore, we intend to use the psycho-physiological responses from the participants during the sessions through peripheral (i.e. ECG, EDA, EMG) and central nervous system responses (i.e. EEG) associated with emotional expression, as well as the participatory input to a visual analog scale (i.e. tactile feedback input system, avoiding huge hands movements and interruptions during carrying session) as an indicator of the subjective experience of emotions during the session (i.e. figures with different moods). This data will be also used to define the contents of each session, through a decision algorithm based on the history of the previous sessions for the same individual. All data resulting from this application will be recorded in a database to create individual reports on the session outcomes. The hardware to be used for psycho-physiological recording will be the Bitalino system (Plux) and the software for the AR development the NyARToolkit and Unity 3D software.

Inability to realize the importance of Linear Algebra and its applications in technical subjects is one of the reasons of poor academic performance of students. The typical teaching approach separates the Linear Algebra's from technical subject. This does not necessarily promote student's awareness in both subjects. This paper presents a new teaching approach which combine Linear Algebra and Image Processing contents. The methodology presented is based in teaching Linear Algebra contents such as matrices and matrix transformation using Image Processing applications. This could lead to a whole new interesting learning environment, new teaching approaches that are more stimulating for students and more productive and dynamic for teachers.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760909","teaching mathematics;linear algebra;image processing","Education;Linear algebra;Electronics packaging;Digital images;Image color analysis","","1","","25","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposal detail ed in this article aims to link Quito with several new generation technologies such as : Internet of Things (IoT), the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard for communication of heterogeneous sensors, and a system of notifications in real time using the protocol Communications Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). These technologies will be used for the development of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) that will take advantage of the mass deployment of smartphones in society as main sources of information, and also include Arduino and Raspberry modules to verify efficient communication. This ITS bases its operation on the crowsensing paradigm, which allows to reflect with greater accuracy the reality of the object of study, the more collaborators use the system; reaching up to 30% improvement in the situational awareness of the environment variable, traffic.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760715","Intemet of Things;Sensor Web Enablement;Message Queue Telemetry Transport;Intelligent Transport System;Crowdsensing","","","1","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More often than not, however, the linguistic competence required to do so is well beyond that of the majority of NNS. While software applications can serve to assist NNS in their English writing tasks, most of the applications available are designed for users of English for general purposes as opposed to English for professional purposes. Therefore, these applications lack the specific vocabulary, style guidelines and common structures required in more specialised documents. Necessary modifications to meet the needs of English for professional purposes tend to be viewed as representing an overly complex and expensive task. To overcome these challenges, we present a software called O-WEAA (Ontology-Writing English Assistant Architecture) which makes use of an ontology that represents the knowledge which, according to our formalisation, is required to write most types of specialised professional documents in the English language. Our formalisation of the required knowledge is based on an exhaustive linguistic analysis of several written genres. The proposed software is composed of two parts: i) a web application named Acquisition Interface Module, which allows experts to populate the ontology with new data and ii) a user-friendly, general web interface named Writing Assistant Interface Module which guides the user throughout the writing process of the English document in the specific domain described in the ontology.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760895","Knowledge Acquisition;Knowledge Representation;Corpus Linguistics;Ontology Classification and Retrieval;Natural Language Processing","Software;Tools;Linguistics;Dictionaries;Ontologies;Task analysis","","1","","19","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the automatic extraction of features from multispectral images, many researchers have appealed to the use of CNN models, which integrate layers with different structures in context with the solution of a problem, which suggests quite a challenge. That is why, in this article, we propose a method to evaluate the stability in the design of convolutional layers for labeling and identification of palm cultivation units from multispectral images. The structure of the proposed convolutional layer will be given in terms of a fuzzy feature map, obtained as a result of the Cartesian product of three vegetation indices commonly used to evaluate plant vigor in this type of crops (NDVI, GNDVI, RVI), represented as compact maps (radial basis functions). The stability in the design will be given in terms of the dominance of the main diagonal that defines the structure of a convolutional layer obtained as a result of the Cartesian product of two compact maps that represent the same multispectral image.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760741","Convolutional Layer;Deep Learning Models;Convolutional Neural Networks;Dominance Index;Fuzzy Cognitive Map","Deep learning;Vegetation mapping;Indexes;Adaptation models;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","","9","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to its big dimension, it presents some difficulties regarding its organization. The lack of cohesion of the parade during its course is one of the issues observed that originates several and large empty spaces, which end up to discredit the parade. This paper presents the study the issue related with the Parade's organization/planning, by proposing a solution based on low-cost technologies. In this work we intend to study the problem of empty spaces, proposing a solution based on low cost technologies and evaluating the performance of this solution with its potential users. In this way, a process of collect information was initiated through the observation of the Parade, an interview with the organization and a inquiry of the collaborators and another one for the drivers. Based on the collected information, it is proposed a solution that uses smartphones to interconnect through a mobile application and also a web management application, in order to monitor the Parade and help in suppressing empty spaces. The proposal was evaluated to its potential users through a functional prototype. Usability and User Experience tests were performed and the results were promising. It is intended to validate the proposed solution in the field and extend the proposal to other Parade.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760674","courtship;parade;distributed coordination;GPS;mobile application","Global Positioning System;Smart phones;Monitoring;Laser radar;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Urban areas","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The focus is on Integrated Reporting - IR that presents financial and non-financial information through integrated thinking. An Integrated Reporting presents a hybrid situation because it includes financial information that is subjected to a mandatory audit, and non-financial information that can be assured in a voluntary basis. In this way, the inclusion of assurance information can be seen through a legitimation lens representing the organizations' effort to increase legitimacy. The motivation behind this paper is to discuss the assurance presented on Integrated Reporting. The research's objective is to provide an analysis on the differences between companies from different geographical origins related to the assurance provided on Integrated Reporting. The methodological approach is characterized by a qualitative study on the assurance included in Integrated Reporting. The empirical analysis is related to the analysis of the reports of 45 organizations. We find that the company's geographical origins implicate differences in the information disclosed related to assurance. The paper's contribution consists on new insights into the emergent field of assurance on Integrated Reporting with the increase of the understanding of the assurance report's characteristics, which are disclosed by companies from different geographical settings.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760836","Integrated Reporting;Legitimacy Theory;Sustainability Reporting;Sustainability Assurance;Integrated Reporting Assurance","Companies;Sustainable development;Ethics;Europe;Standards organizations","","","","26","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The treatment and analysis of the collected data allowed to point out a set of performance indicators that could characterize food waste over time, according to the following categories: i) food waste index (ADI), ii) number of meals waste “(NRD) and iii) generated waste accumulator (ADG). For these indicators, several representation (visualization and synthesis) supports were identified and studied to create a dashboard that is intended to be objective and intuitive concerning the reading of waste generated in an ERC. The aim of the work in progress is to develop a proposal for the representation of waste indicators, which allows the identification of consumption patterns, contributing to daily planning and decision making in ERCs. Developments in progress are intended to contribute to reducing the levels of waste through ongoing support in the planning and preparation of menus. Resource management and good operating practices require simple, objective, replicable and ideally inexpensive collection procedures. In this sense, a compromise solution is presented between the operationalization of the collection (observations and representation), the details of the data collected and their synthesis and visualization in an operational dashboard. The applicability of the proposal under development (indicators and dashboard) was subject to some tests with real data of an ERC, being the current study a first contribution to the treatment of the sustainability problems generated by the wastes produced in this sector of activity.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760929","Catering Company;planning Meals;waste;sustainability;dashboard","Monitoring;Planning;Information systems;Containers;Companies;Data visualization","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In short, there is at least a problem with traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems, as they cannot suggest the best combination of tasks, people and timings, which can increase the benefits of running them, while reducing the costs and risk factors. Yet, it is an irrefutable fact that the current business environment is highly dynamic. On the one hand, we need to be more efficient to execute what is operational and obvious, releasing scarce resources for more critical areas. Then, dealing with business process management and automation, a common claimed benefit is associated with the improvement of performance. In addition to this and other potential benefits, we also highlight some potential operational risks from the adoption of AI-based systems like RPA. The acceleration in the business context makes it more difficult to predict what changes will occur and how they can affect the technological solutions used in the increasingly automated business processes. We point out the fact that immature or not well-trained models can eventually decrease productivity and increase errors from unsupported or even wrong decisions. We present a case study in the banking sector, which illustrates some examples of benefits and risks arising from BPM solutions that use AI-related agents/artifacts.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760733","Business Process (BP);Business Process Management (BPM);Business Process Automatiom (BPA);Robotic Process Automatiom (RPA);Artificial Intelligence (AI)","Automation;Task analysis;Robots;Artificial intelligence;Tools","","43","","26","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Historically, the tax favors the financing of economic activity through debt, the so-called debt bias, led to over-indebtedness of national firms with harmful effects on the economy, aggravated in a context of increasing international competition. This study investigates the impact of the new tax framework for corporate financing on firms' leverage, focusing on the analysis of the trienniums 2010-2012 and 2014-2016, pre- and post-alteration, respectively. Our findings suggest that after 2013, the firms covered by the new regime adjusted their capital structures, which means they reduced their average leverage levels. Moreover, we find a negative relationship between leverage and average effective tax rate which, contrarily to what would be expected, was not weakened, but slightly reinforced, by the new regime.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760767","corporate income tax;capital structure;leverage;financing expenses","Finance;Art;Europe;Information systems;Limiting;Economics;Focusing","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last decade, this digital transformation has led to a change in the behavior of marketers and managers around the world. It should be noted that, although there are still some fears arising from the use of social media in the B2B context, it is unquestionable that these have become essential in the design of a competitive strategy. The purpose of our study is to identify the main determinants of the adoption of social media in the B2B context. Based on a sample of 223 workers from B2B companies, the structural equations model was used to test the relationships among the variables learning, memorability, errors, usability, usefulness, social influence, satisfaction, trust, intention to use social media and adoption of social media. The results showed that all variables considered are fundamental in explaining the adoption of social media.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760701","Social Media;adoption;key determinants;B2B relations","Social networking (online);Internet;Information systems;Mathematical model;Companies;Usability","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this paper aims to analyze what kind of studies have already been carried out, what methodology and what sample are used, results and what limitations and gaps are found, in order to provide guidelines for the Project. A systematic literature review has been done, structured from original publications, dated from 2008 to 2019 and based on the concepts: quality of life, information and communication technologies, older adults, aging and active aging. Although there were few studies, the results identify that is important to pay particular attention to the selection and distribution of the participants by groups and to the size of the sample. In addition, they reinforce the positive relationship between the use of technologies and the maintenance or improvement of quality of life, reduction of the feeling of loneliness, and promotion of active aging.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760768","quality os life;information and communications technologies;older adult","Stress;Aging;Internet;Instruments;Information and communication technology;Information systems;Cultural differences","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Promoting physical activity is a priority challenge and audiovisual content can give an important help to achieve this aim. Nevertheless, it is fundamental that the potential consumers of these contents identify themselves with them and can use them easily to support their practice of physical activity. In this paper, the authors describe a strategy that was followed to develop a set of audiovisual contents potentially capable of supporting the elderly to perform certain physical exercises. This strategy considered various preferences revealed by this group and involved them throughout the development process. Given the widespread use of mobile phones and their potential to be used to support physical activity, this paper also presents an approach for making these contents available within a mobile application that supports physical activity. The results of this stage of a broader study corroborates the idea that older people are predisposed to consume this type of content and recognize it as valuable. It also contributes to better understand in what way this type of content can be delivered in a mobile application that is being developed to support older adults to carry out physical activities plans.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760724","Digital Video;Physical Exercises;Physical Activity;Older adults;Mobile application","Statistics;Mobile applications;Smart phones;Senior citizens;Visualization;Information systems","","1","","15","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design changes and the increase of automatisms, leads to transformations in the interaction between the operator and the decision support system, also reverting to changes in the cognitive processes, in the processes of information search and processing, such as situational awareness, anticipatory thinking. These changes can affect operators, both positively or negatively, and may have the opposite effect to the intended. They can cause an increase of the cognitive effort or until the undervaluation of events that are relevant to the safety of navigation. The present article presents preliminary results of a study that aims to analyse the work performed by the RADAR operator and the cognitive processes present during a period of great cognitive activity for all elements of the ship bridge. The data are being collected on Portuguese naval vessels sailing in high density areas of navigation and proximity to hazards, in the ports of Lisbon and Setubal. Records are made using Eye Trackers operated in the RADAR operator and by observing their work in a team, supported by audio and video recordings of all the activity on the ship's bridge. These data are complemented by two questionnaires for assessment of situational awareness and work effort (SART and NASA-TLX), totalizing the data of three questionnaires. The results suggest that the RADAR operator is subject to a high cognitive effort and that the interaction with the team is very important for this to maintain a good level of situational knowledge.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760656","Eye trackers;Navigation;Cognitive processes;RADAR","Radar tracking;Navigation;Cognitive processes;Visualization;Safety;Marine vehicles","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Internal audit functions are therefore encouraged to use technology-based tools such as GAS in the execution of their duties in an effort to respond to its various stakeholders' needs and expectations in an efficient and effective manner. GAS comes with a number of different functionalities that the internal auditor can use. This paper explores the purpose of the use of GAS as a data analytics tool by internal audit functions in Australia. The research results indicate that respondents are utilising GAS for a variety of purposes. The top five purposes for which the respondents make use of GAS often to always during separate internal audit engagements are: (1) for conducting full population analyses; (2) to identify transactions with specific characteristics or control criteria for tests of controls purposes; (3) to evaluate fraud risks; (4) to obtain audit evidence about control effectiveness; and (5) for selecting random samples for tests of controls purposes from key electronic files.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760882","Computer Assisted Audit Techniques;Control environment;Generalised Audit Software;Internal Audit;Tests of Controls","Data analysis;Tools;Australia;Inhibitors;Planning;Task analysis;Monitoring","","1","","53","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current work presents a proposal of solution to help manage the demands related to the process of prediction, evaluation and classification of shutdowns in Brazilian Hydropower Plants for a regulatory agency. The method, by weighing a relevant set of factors, aims to indicate the projects which should be prioritized by the inspection team, based on criteria data mining techniques such as logistic regression.

This evolution has allowed almost unlimited access to the content, without having to be subject to the programming grid of a television, now there is the possibility of seeing what you want, when and where you want. However, an increase in the demand for content through television brings with it several disadvantages: the need to adapt to different screens and devices, the speed of connection, the location or the validation of the subscribers. The above generates a problem in the fragmentation of the audience, both for advertisers and for distributors, who affirm a sustainable business model. For example, the subscription to video on demand (SVOD) model, as offered by Netflix or HBO, makes programmers and distributors address some of the concerns of advertisers to increase the flow of investment in television advertising. Some of them would be: Scale, it is not enough to buy time in a program that is broadcast in a predetermined time zone; Measurement, the gross audience index (GRP) metric is no longer as simple as a result of the different broadcast platforms and devices; In technology, we find users who want to access content from different devices, or even want to see a series on their smartphone while they are on the train and can continue when they get home, this time on the television in their living room. The evolution in which television is immersed affects both the audience and advertising. In recent years, the effort is focused on finding a solution to the fragmentation of the audience, with the consequent obtaining of the optimization of budget revenues and advertising campaigns. The work presented here carries out an analysis of the audiences, through the study of the websites of four SVOD platforms: Netflix, Blockbuster, Hulu and HBO.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760790","audiovisual content;SVOD;video on demand;audience;Netflix;advertising","TV;Internet;Adaptation models;Video on demand;Advertising;DVD;Information systems","","4","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How can we ensure that the technology we develop and/or evaluate does not harmfully impact our research participants, even if unintentionally? Drawing on a case study of a communication app developed to address loneliness and social isolation in later life, as well as on years of ethnographic fieldwork with older people, we argue for an ethical display approach. This approach: i) bridges procedural and situational ethics, ii) engages ethics throughout the research process, and iii) maps both positive and negative `unintended consequences', applying Robert K.

Traditional marketing, conventional advertising and reduced price strategies, lose effectiveness in a new era in which the consumer acquires power and prominence, so in addition to the improvement and evolution of the characteristics of the products, it must be provided attention to the customer experience, since the potential lies in conquering the emotions of consumers.

In fact, this generation is seen as a potentiator of market growth, considering that the future of the luxury sector will depend on the capacity to reach this generation. This topic is particularly relevant for the marketing area, namely for the tourism sector. Another of the major trends for the tourism sector is the sustainability issue, with an emphasis on ecotourism. In this work we discuss the main contributions of the literature that allow to interlink the domains of luxury marketing, millennial generation, and ecotourism, proposing a set of hypotheses for future research.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760822","millennials;luxury;marketing;trends;ecoturism","Market research;Companies;Information systems;Millennials;Cultural differences","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of technological artifacts, including robotics, has gained prominence in the educational area due to the possibility of developing low cost prototypes, allowing the use of a larger portion of the school community. Since the pedagogical process can be benefited by the use of artifacts to demonstrate concepts, a research was developed to identify which technologies are or may be appropriate for use in the teaching-learning process in the Brazilian Basic Education. This paper presents the results of the research from the perspective of teachers of this phase of education. From these results, it is possible to guide future work related to the development of pedagogical proposals mediated by these technologies, mainly related to the use of demonstration artifacts.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760595","Educational Technologies;Educational Robotics;Basic Education","Information systems;Educational technology;Software;Robot sensing systems;Hardware","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Human Machine Interface (HMI) for manufacturing process control is a key component within this concept. This work presents the process of developing an HMI, supported by web technology, and adapted for an additive manufacturing equipment. The HMI should allow monitoring and manipulation of its parameters by providing the operator with a tool capable of providing timely information on the manufacturing process as well as the equipment itself and should allow direct control of the instrument. The paper presents and describes, the adopted methodology, the proposed architecture, the prototypes and the studies with the users and the respective results of the usability tests. Users were involved in the design process. The final interface was assessed very positively by the users (operators).","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4349-3","10.23919/CISTI.2019.8760932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760932","Human Machine Interface;Industry 4.0;Smart Industry;User Centered Design","Software;Monitoring;Process control;Visualization;Industries;Hardware;Manuals","","","","","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
