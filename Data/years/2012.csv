In a short time span, high speed Internet has become fundamental to modern economies, allowing access to increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated services; thus, it is important to monitor its progress. One of the most frequently used indicators in the international context to measure the Information Society progress, is the Broadband Penetration Rate. This indicator is often misused and limited to the discussion about the progress of countries and regions in terms of their integration in the Information Society. This article intends to present clear evidence that this is an indicator which, despite providing us with important signals regarding the spread of broadband, has several weaknesses, inevitably affecting the conclusions that can be drawn concerning concrete policies to effectively promote broadband. Consequently, the abusive tendency to solely use this indicator to measure the success or failure of policies that can promote the development of the Information Society originates simplistic and limited analyses and leads to erroneous conclusions.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263053","Broadband;Broadband Penetration Rate;Information Society","Internet;Broadband communication;FCC;Monitoring;Europe;Abstracts","","","","22","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their performance depends on their ability to evacuate generated heat outside the working assembly to the air. A very effective and widespread method often used in engineering employs the fins. They act as a thermal bridge between the heating wall and the reactive medium. However, their design is very complex given the wide range of models employed. The model selection then becomes very difficult for the machine designer owing to the number of often conflicting constraints faced. The complexity of mathematical models of heat transfer phenomena, cannot allow considering an analytical and/or digital solution. This technological gap motivated considering a discussion in the present paper. A decision support system design is proposed.

In this environment, and given the increasing organizational complexity, the use of a methodology to assist the implementation of outsourcing projects has become almost necessary. In recent years several methodologies and models have been proposed, especially for supporting client outsourcing organizations, but we do not consider them to be complete, they do not cover all necessary aspects to manage an outsourcing project.

Thus, energy costs are a significant determining factor in economic and social prosperity. Consequently, politics, industry and research focus on both exploitation of alternative energy sources for energy generation and development of concepts, methodologies and technologies to reduce energy consumption. A remaining challenge is energy analysis and optimization of complex systems, such as industrial automation systems. Individuality and dynamics of the system's surroundings during operation time make it difficult to identify goal-oriented optimization measures. This contribution proposes a model-based user-centric approach for automated energy analysis of systems of industrial automation systems. The approach supports users in reducing their energy costs by automated generation and application of individual electrical energy optimization proposals. The goal is effort and complexity reduction by mapping elements and influences with impact on electrical energy costs to appropriate models for model-based analysis. The focus of this paper is on support for model creation by the introduction of hierarchical analysis levels that enhance user-centricity of the proposed approach.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263056","energy;analysis;user-centric;model-based","Optimization;Automation;Analytical models;Water heating;Proposals;Energy consumption;Computational modeling","","","","21","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we describe a system that uses pervasive computing technologies for advertising purposes. It uses contextual information and personal interactions to delivered ads to individuals and to support socially-aware content selection to best fit users' interests in a public place. Based on personal interactions, the system builds an up-to-date social model that combines information about categories and ads the individual users' accessed and contextual information. This model, combined with the ads characterization and financial issues, supports the decision of which ad will be presented at each moment. Based on these principles, an advertising system was developed and evaluated. Initial results indicate that this can be an interesting approach to improve the usefulness of pervasive advertising systems for both individuals and people in public spaces.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263063","Adaptive Systems;Ambient Intelligence;Context-Aware Applications;Pervasive Advertising;Public Recommender Systems;Socially-Aware Computing;Ubiquitous Computing","Advertising;Mobile handsets;Context;History;Servers;Pervasive computing;Bluetooth","","1","","12","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model refers to returns, prices and transaction volumes of stocks that are listed on the Colombian Stock Exchange (BVC), and particularly to time series that represent the returns of the stocks of Ecopetrol. The proposed model uses the estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA's) for the short-term projection of the returns of such stocks. The EDAs, unlike other optimization techniques that are based on traditional evolution algorithms, provide greater statistical robustness in shaping the population of individuals and with respect to the number of generations that are required to solve the problem. For this purpose the EDA incorporates three dynamic populations that explore the solution space of the problem by using a mechanism which propagates the differences that exist among the best individuals. Additionally, it includes a strategy to preserve the diversity of the population. The proposed model allowed short-term projections for the future values of the returns of Ecopetrol stocks, departing from a set of parameters and variables that make up the stock price. This way the behavior of a specific asset can be described over time and the complexity which is associated with the application of traditional techniques, that allow the modeling of financial time series, can be eliminated.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263068","Time Series;Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA's);Evolutionary Computation;Evolutionary Mechanism;Ecopetrol","Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Time series analysis;Estimation;Evolutionary computation;Covariance matrix;Media","","","","23","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even if the current video capsules can provide a good assistance for diagnosis tasks, especially on the small bowel's examination, the necessity of performance's improvement is evident. In order to increase frame rate and reduce energy consumption, a possible solution is the image's compression. A number of freely available lossless and lossy codec libraries were evaluated regarding objective criteria as peak signal-to-noise ratio and software's running times, providing a good estimation about image's quality, algorithm's complexity and energy consumption when computing medical images. Based on characteristics of the video sequences not exploited by the current implementations, an ultra low complexity video codec is proposed.

The model gathers industry standards and literature of ERP, linking three determinants anchored on RBV to `ERP value' (usage, collaboration and analytics capabilities), on which three hypotheses are postulated. Testing was conducted thought structural equation modeling as implemented in partial least squares (PLS) on a data set web surveyed across Portuguese firms. Our findings show that collaboration and analytics capabilities, together with usage, will contribute to `ERP value'. This study contributes to the ERP literature, in particular how SMEs can exploit value from ERP.

Risk events, that have been defined by the national regulator, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia, according to the definitions of the Basel Accord II, will be modeled by using linguistic variables. The relationship between events will be described in terms of a number of inference rules provided by an expert; while the fuzzy sets are described by the frequency and severity that can be associated with each event. The results that were obtained through the model showed good behavior with regard to the construction of the loss distribution (LDA), and as well with respect to the estimated value at risk (OpVaR), for which a number of scenarios were taken into account that allowed a simulation of data associated to the management of this type of risk.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263091","Takagi Sugeno Fuzzy Logic;Operational Risk;Information Systems;Aggregate Loss Distribution (LDA);OpVar (Operational Value at Risk)","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Data models;Analytical models;Bayesian methods;Silicon compounds;Risk management","","","","37","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the suggested learning system, QR codes will allow an automatic authentication on moodle platform by the student through his profile and his mobile device. These codes enclose the necessary information to connect the context-oriented materials and the learning places. Each student follows guidelines with the instructions of the learning places to visit, informing about the QR codes to decrypt.

A central Portuguese hospital has a Virtual Electronic Patient Record that includes a Breast Pathology module (VCBreastCare) being used for the last 3 years. Aim. We aim to (1) select and implement MAs in VCBreastCare and (2) evaluate the use of these by its' users. Methods. First, a list of algorithms was retrieved through a site search in The Medical Algorithm Project (Medal), and experts selected 13 medical algorithms. An extra algorithm considered important that was not in Medal was included. A questionnaire to evaluate the importance of each of the 14 MAs was applied to the VCBreastCare users and the 3 most important MAs were implemented using Web technologies. The evaluation of their use was performed by another questionnaire and by analyzing the MAs usage logs during the first 3 months. Results. MAs for “Family History”, “Breast Biopsy” and “TNM Classification” were implemented and made available in September 2011. Although the physicians initially considered MAs important, they did not use them significantly (<; 1% of patients). Discussion. The low usage rate was disappointing when compared with their initial motivation. Four explanations/measures can now be proposed: (1) due to the high quality of the health professionals involved MAs are simply not useful, (2) the selected MAs were not the most appropriate, and so new MAs will be implemented, (3) automate MAs, thus the result is automatically calculated and alerts are displayed indicating consults or exams that patient should do, or (4) users will be forced to use the MAs by incorporating them in the patient record.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263099","medical algorithms;breast pathology;evaluation","Classification algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Breast cancer;Breast biopsy","","","","19","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hands, since 1999 the SQL specification has introduced new features to manipulate objects in relational databases which since then has been called Object-Relational Database (ORDB). At present, many DBMS offer resources to manipulate objects in database, but the most of the application developers just map class to relations tables, failing to exploit the strength of O-R model. The lack of the tools that aid the project of database contributes to this situation.

It describes the extent to which the presented system facilitates the interaction and communication between members of the academic community, using the Internet, with services available on the Web complementing them with email, SMS and CTI. Through a perception, backed by empirical analysis and results of investigations, it demonstrates how this type of practice may raise the level of satisfaction of the community. In particular, it is possible to combat failure at school, avoid that students leave their course before its completion and also that they recommend them to potential students. In addition, such a strategy also allows strong economies in the management of the institution, increasing its value.

To raise the security awareness we present an analysis of BT attack methods and tools over time. We paid particular attention to the severity, possible targets and the ability to persist over new versions of BT. Results show that adversaries can take complete control of the victims' mobile device features if they forget to use simple safety measures like turning off the BT when not in use.

Typical this kind of distribution is made by television channel broadcasters which try to make their content globally available, using viewer's resources to support a large scale distribution of video without incurring in incremental costs. However, the lack of adaptation in video quality, combined with the lack of a standard protocol for this kind of multimedia distribution has driven content providers to basically ignore it as a solution for video delivery over the Internet. While the scalable extension of the H.264 encoding (H.264/SVC) can be used to support terminal and network heterogeneity, it is not clear how it can be integrated in a P2P overlay to form a large scale and real time distribution. In this paper, we start by defining a solution that combines the most popular P2P file-sharing protocol, the BitTorrent, with the H.264/SVC encoding for a real-time video content delivery.

This paper focuses on design and preliminary considerations to implement a messaging service according to a virtual communities model. LRN was used as a learning platform for design and implementation tests, and we addressed advantages and disadvantages of using contracted services as opposite to local implementations. In addition, we present some considerations about proprietary hardware and software, data security and some of main problems were encountered during the implementation process.

In order to achieve that, the battery-powered wireless motes have to optimize the usage of their batteries to make them last longer. However, these motes must keep doing the main purpose for which they were deployed, that is, sampling the environment. These requirements provide a research framework in which many authors have been studying in the last years. They have stated several different descriptions of ""sensor network lifetime"". Some definitions measure the time when the first network mote stops working (due to the lack of battery energy). Other definitions keep track of the time spent until a certain amount of motes fail. In these cases, the network lifetime is independent of the sampled environment and does not take into account redundancy and fault tolerance. Using a new innovative concept of network lifetime, a new battery-powered WSN lifetime model based in data redundacy and hardware redundacy is proposed. With this model, energy consumption can be minimized, and therefore, a reduction in the change of batteries is obtained. The proposed method also provides a new metric which determines when a network stops being useful.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263125","formatting;style;styling;insert","Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Redundancy;Batteries;Mathematical model;Fault tolerant systems","","","","19","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present survey was made among people who regularly use the services of libraries. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of the population and 787 answers were obtained. Data was collected from readers who attend several types of libraries: public (central and local), of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, belonging to the universities, specialized and private. The findings of this research suggest that the vast majority of the readers, despite exhibiting high degree of expectations, consider that the services of the libraries have a good quality; and the values found for the gaps are not significant. The readers' perception of the service quality is also high considering the various types of libraries analyzed, which may eventually be considered a good indicator of the quality and performance of the professionals who work in libraries. Based on the findings of the present research we conclude that the service quality in the library network approaches significantly to what is expected by the users.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263128","SERVQUAL;Satisfaction of the User;Evaluation;Information Services;Library Services;Total Quality Management","","","","","30","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However the analysis of speech at the acoustic level could be not enough to determine the emotion of a user speaking in a realistic scenario. In this paper we analysed the spontaneous speech recordings of the FAU Aibo Corpus at the acoustic and linguistic levels to extract two sets of acoustic and linguistic features. The acoustic set was reduced by a greedy procedure selecting the most relevant features to optimize the learning stage. We experimented with three classification approaches: Naïve-Bayes, a support vector machine and a logistic model tree, and two fusion schemes: decision-level fusion, merging the hard-decisions of the acoustic and linguistic classifiers by means of a decision tree; and feature-level fusion, concatenating both sets of features before the learning stage. Despite the low performance achieved by the linguistic data, a dramatic improvement was achieved after its combination with the acoustic information, improving the results achieved by this second modality on its own. The results achieved by the classifiers using the parameters merged at feature level outperformed the classification results of the decision-level fusion scheme, despite the simplicity of the scheme.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263129","Emotion recognition;spontaneous speech;acoustic features;linguistic features;decision-level fusion;feature-level fusion","Acoustics;Pragmatics;Speech;Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Logistics;Training","","1","","29","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation of physical, chemical and biological processes in coastal ecosystems is used as a way to understand the system internal dynamics and to predict its evolution over time, in order to promote behaviors environmentally friendly and to induce effective and efficient management of the ecosystem as a whole. However, there are several ways of translating and interpreting the data provided by the simulation such as applying appropriate data mining models. This paper describes an approach that uses a Decision Tree model to produce intuitive information about the influence of several environmental variables on the growth conditions of bivalve species within an aquaculture exploration in a coastal ecosystem. This information is captured by relating the values of simulated variables, like water temperature or organic matter, with the length of the bivalve's shell, extrapolating information about the organic or physical conditions that increase or decrease the growth of the bivalve species, and guiding the stakeholders to locations for the best practice of the seeding process.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263134","Decision Trees;Patterns;Data Preparation;Ecological Behavior","Decision trees;Biological system modeling;Ecosystems;Data models;Mathematical model;Vegetation;Sea measurements","","","","12","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their importance is considerable when it comes to guarantee safety and protection during a crisis. However, sometimes discrepancies arise between the goals of the plan and its outcomes, because people find it hard to take them very seriously, or due to the financial and time resources required. Serious games are a possible solution to tackle this problem. They have been successfully applied in different areas such as health care and education, since they can simulate an environment/task quite accurately, making them a practical alternative to real-life simulations. This paper presents a serious game developed using Unity 3D to recreate a virtual fire evacuation training tool. The prototype application was deployed which allowed the validation by user testing. A sample of 30 individuals tested the evacuating scenario, having to leave the building during a fire in the shortest time possible. Results have shown that users effectively end up learning some evacuation procedures from the activity, even if only to look for emergency signs indicating the best evacuation paths. It was also evidenced that users with higher video game experience had a significantly better performance.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263136","Evacuation simulator;fire drill;modelling and simulation;serious games","Games;Buildings;Fires;Training;Computational modeling;Engines","","6","","15","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a matter of example, in automated trading systems a delay of 1 ms may be worth $1M. In addition, nowadays business decisions are made on the basis of increasing volumes of information, complicating the adoption of decisions on time. These requirements are common to those found in other real-time application domains. Consequently, adapting certain tools used in such domains may be a solution for business applications too. This paper draws several scenarios where middleware based solutions are justified, with particular insight on real-time behavior and control of QoS (Quality of Service) needs. More specifically, we provide certain guidelines to use OMG DDS (Data Distribution Service) as communications backbone in soft real-time business applications. DDS is a recent publish/subscribe middleware specification which provides mechanisms aimed at easing the creation of complex distributed applications such as those allowing the definition of content filters or tuning QoS parameters. Unfortunately, DDS is a complex technology so the programmers of business applications may benefit from certain guidelines that help them in the identification of the topics as well as the values for the QoS parameters provided by DDS.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263138","Middleware;QoS;Eventing;Publish/Subscribe;DDS core","Quality of service;Real time systems;Middleware;Reliability;Business;Guidelines;Servers","","","","18","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two additional modules were required when performing the movement: Inverse kinematics module which computes the value of the joints to position the foot at a given position and the stability module which is responsible for the robot's stability. Simulation tests are performed under different ball positions, relative to the robot's orientation, and for various ball directions.

The problem lies in lighting conditions differences from real environment and virtual objects superimposed. This problem takes on special significance indoors, to visualize interior design proposals, because a non-integrated scene may seem unlikely and unattractive. In this paper, we describe a teaching experience conducted in the framework of an interior design specialization course. It was carried out by students from the School of Building Construction of Barcelona in November 2011, at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Students were required to use AR freeware tools for modeling and visualize their own proposals indoor. The challenging task was to make virtual objects blend harmoniously into the real scene, so they should appear as if they were like real. New modeling techniques have been experienced in order to add lighting conditions maps to virtual objects. We used for that radiance and global illumination simulations from the real environment to get real scene lighting information. Experience was useful to determine the consistency of illumination between the virtual objects and the surrounding real objects in the scene, as well as, to evaluate the importance of the use of this technology in interior design proposals and architectural visualization.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263163","Interior design;Augmented reality;education methodologies;luminic immersion","Visualization;Lighting;Software;Materials;Education;Augmented reality;Proposals","","","4","33","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of a Channel Assignment Problem (CAP) is to assign appropriate number of required channels to each cell in a way to achieve both efficient frequency spectrum utilization and minimization of interference effects (by satisfying a number of channel reuse constraints). Channel assignment algorithms are formulated as combinatorial optimization problems and are NP-hard. Devising a DCA, that is practical, efficient, and which can generate high quality assignments, is challenging. Though Metaheuristic Search techniques like Evolutionary Algorithms, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization prove effective in the solution of Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA) problems but they still require high computational time and therefore may be inefficient for DCA. A number of approaches have been proposed for the solution of DCA problem but the high complexity of these proposed approaches makes them unsuitable/less efficient for practical use. Therefore, this paper presents an effective and efficient Hybrid Discrete Binary Differential Evolution Algorithm (HDB-DE) for the solution of DCA Problem.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263173","Dynamic Channel Assignment;Mobile Networks;Optimization and Soft Computing","Vectors;Convergence;Benchmark testing;Algorithm design and analysis;Interchannel interference;Equations","","2","","24","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research intents to characterize the organizations and the knowledge strategy implemented; it also intends to identify technologies, practices and processes used and to acknowledge benefits and difficulties of knowledge management systems implementation. Other purpose of the research was to identify the job title for those responsible for knowledge management activities. The main findings indicate that job titles are very diverse and in most case don't explicitly refer the expression knowledge management. According to knowledge management technologies, the most commonly used by the organizations are corporate intranets or portals. The study results show that the existence of a knowledge management strategy or a business strategy including a knowledge management dimension in organizations is critical. In that cases the resistance of employees to carry out knowledge management activities is lower. However, only a third part of organizations refers the knowledge management dimension in their business strategy and even fewer organizations have a knowledge management strategy. The main difficulty faced by organizations when it comes to implementing knowledge strategy is the lack of experience and expertise in the area of KM. On the other hand, the main benefit identified was to be able to explore more efficiently the existing knowledge within the organization. Moreover, the study concludes that KM efforts assume different levels in organizations implanted in Portugal. Large organizations seem to have high levels of formalization and implementation of KM activities. However, most organizations still presents very incipient initiatives and results show that the implementation of knowledge activities is mainly a result of informal and isolated initiatives developed by few employees in organizations.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263174","knowledge management;strategy;organization;technologies","Knowledge management;Organizations;Portals;Internet;Software;Hardware","","","","8","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, each day the concern for the quality of software product itself and not only by the processes used for development is greater. Thus, standards have emerged as the ISO / IEC 25000, which define a quality model and an evaluation process for the product. However, certifications that take as their object the software product itself and ensure compliance of the product of a set of requirements, are less widespread.

Cellphones, smartphone's, PDA's, MP3 devices, laptops, tablets and more recently vehicles, are some examples of devices where a Bluetooth interface is present. As these devices are always used or carried by persons, we can study patterns of human mobility by analyzing the electromagnetic signals produced by these devices, in this case by the Bluetooth interfaces. Among other options, these studies can be realized through activities of Collaborative Sensing. The Bluetooth technology is normally used in an environment that does not consider the mobility of the devices. An example of this is when we exchange files between a smartphone and a laptop, both devices are relatively close and motionless during the file exchange. In this paper we evaluate the potential of the Bluetooth technology as a source of data for human mobility analysis in dense urban environments with high mobility, such as a street in a city. For this, the probability of detecting a Bluetooth device in a mobile environment has been estimated both theoretically and experimentally. The achieved results show that Bluetooth is suitable for activities of Collaborative Sensing.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263195","Bluetooth;high mobility;detection probability","Bluetooth;Vehicles;Performance evaluation;Sensors;Collaboration;Portable computers;Probability","","","","8","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the fact that ITIL does not formally consider the existence of a Service Management Office (SMO) as a way to guarantee its permanence and efficiency once the ITIL implementation phase ends, an online survey was applied to 169 Latin American companies in order to answer the question: What does an organization need in order to guarantee ITIL goes beyond its implementation stages? Evidence suggests that the main challenges on implementing ITIL are the time devoted by the IT staff involved in the project, their capabilities in the understanding of ITIL purposes, and the support from senior management; therefore, the existence of an SMO could represent a way of facing those challenges and realizing ITIL benefits more effectively, representing also new challenges for IT professionals.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263206","ITIL;SMO;Service Management Office;organizational structure;Organizational Models and Information Systems (OMIS)","Companies;Standards organizations;Information technology;Best practices;Customer satisfaction","","","","18","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data is daily generated and then sent to a central database in the Ministry of Health's Central Administration for the Health System (ACSS), which, after aggregation, is sent to Regional Health Administrations (ARS) and other institutions. Given the scope of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto (FMUP) as a teaching and research institution, and as a result of collaborations established with ARS North and ARS Center, the data that each intervener has access to was provided. Thus arises the motivation for writing this article, seeking to ascertain dissimilarities between different data sources and the possible implications of these differences to the hospital production numbers and consequently to its funding. To achieve our aim we used a tool to calculate indicators, namely the indicators “Inpatient data” and “Case-mix”, selected to represent the hospital production. The results obtained show significant differences between the data obtained directly from the five hospitals present in this study and the aggregated data obtained from ACSS. This kind of data is commonly used in many studies for various purposes such as epidemiologic studies or hospital performance management. It is never too much to stress the need to be aware of possible data disparities among different data sources, even if the primary source is the same.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263213","hospital databases;case-mix;hospital production;funding","Hospitals;Databases;Production;Educational institutions;Medical diagnostic imaging;Information systems;Surges","","","","21","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Poor data can lead to loss of competitiveness of the organizations holding these data and may even lead to their disappearance, since many of their decision-making are based on them. This makes data cleaning an essential process. The currently existing approaches to solve these problems are closely related with database schemas and specific domains. In order to use this process in different repositories, it is necessary that machines understand these data, i.e., it is necessary an associated semantic. The solution presented includes the use of ontologies: (i) for the specification of data cleaning operations and, (ii) as a way of solving the semantic heterogeneity problems of data stored in different databases. With the cleaning operations defined at the conceptual level and existing mappings between domain ontologies and an ontology associated with a database, they may be instantiated and then proposed to the user to be executed over that database, thus enabling their interoperability.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263214","Interoperability;Ontologies;Data Quality;Data Cleaning","Cleaning;Ontologies;Databases;OWL;Quality management;Data models","","","","18","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, we present a serious game with a multi-touch interface envisioned to encourage and teach digitally excluded people on how to use the Portuguese Automated Teller Machine (ATM): a commodity much needed by society, but still avoided by some, mainly due to their fear of the digital world. An exploratory study was conducted to investigate if a serious game based on a new interaction paradigm can have a positive influence in the struggle against the Portuguese digital divide. We believe that the findings of our pilot case study can be useful to determine if a multi-touch serious game, due to its intuitiveness and ease of use, can stimulate the digitally excluded people to handle the ATM on a regular basis.

This paper describes a way to integrate openEHR queries with HL7 messages to query a local repository of patient information at an external institution, enabling a multi-agent system designed for the retrieval of multi-institutional data to search for and retrieve patient data essential for the process of care delivery. With health open standards and technologies a model was developed in order to enhance the discovery and retrieval of patient health data, this model have harmonized health data source input (HL7) which is modeled through metabolic templates with the same structure of an archetype template, providing openEHR compositions. Consequently building an openEHR repository with the modeled compositions allows the agents to use the Archetype Query Language for searching and retrieving the clinical data found in archetype-based EHRs.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263222","electronic health records;data integration;HL7;openEHR;multi-agent system","Standards;Medical services;Data models;Information systems;XML;Semantics;Educational institutions","","","","17","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus our work on hierarchical medical organizations. The model estimates the reputation of an individual, RTRHIOS, taking into account information from three trust dimensions: the hierarchy of the system; the source of information; and the quality of the results. Besides the concrete reputation value, it is important to know how reliable that value is; for each of the three dimensions we calculate the reliability of the assessed reputations; and aggregating them, the reliability of the reputation of an individual. The modular approach followed in the definition of the different types of reputations provides the system with a high flexibility that allows adapting the model to the peculiarities of each society.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263223","Trust;Reputation;Hierarchy;Quality-Oriented","Reliability;Organizations;Medical services;Adaptation models;Telemedicine;Software agents;Measurement","","","","11","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

João since 2005 that retrieves and integrates clinical record data. One of its modules is a MultiAgent system for Integration of Data (MAID) that provides automatic report retrieval from departmental systems. The currently deployed MAID uses a static interval for the scheduling of report references retrieval actions. As each department differs in report production rate throughout the day and between weekdays there was a need to optimize and adapt the report reference retrieval scheduling according to each departmental system profile. A Scheduling Agent was developed that, through the past report production and retrieval data, generates a dynamic schedule for the report list retrieval agents. Optimization tests were performed for a specific period of time and a specific department. A set of monitoring data was collected to observe and compare the differences between non-optimized static scheduling and optimized adaptive versions of MAID. The changes introduced by the scheduling agent allow for an optimized report reference retrieval, adjusted to the report production patterns of each department.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263224","Multi-agent systems;electronic health records;systems integration;optimization","Schedules;Optimization;Monitoring;Receivers;Databases;Dynamic scheduling","","","","8","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Evidences of this emergence are the existence of smart homes, smart vehicles, intelligent manufacturing systems and most importantly, the appearance of the concept of intelligent cities. Humans are presently surrounded by technology that is intended to increase their quality of life and simplify their daily activities. Multi-Agent Systems are an example of technology that can be used in these activities. The concept of ubiquitous computing is implicit in these technologies and can generate an invisible ambient of interactivity. This paper presents a survey and a comparative analysis of some of the research projects concerning Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The main objective of this work was to understand the current necessities, devices and the main results in the development of these projects. By analysing these projects using several evaluation criteria one of the main conclusions is that most projects do not explore the potential of human profiles in the context of ambient adaptation. Thus, this may be a very interesting research area for future work.","2166-0735","978-989-96247-7-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263229","ambient intelligence;multi-agent systems;ubiquitous computing;human-computer interaction;profiling","Humans;Ambient intelligence;Context;Intelligent sensors;Human computer interaction;Sensor systems","","1","","22","","30 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These approaches not only require effort on the part of those who develop them, but also create dependency between the developed context-aware applications and the systems developed for obtaining and providing the context information, thus hindering their reuse in other applications.
