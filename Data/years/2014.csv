From this axiomatic truth, the primary objective of this dissertation is focused on the analysis and specification of an information system that would allow better monitoring of the mentally ill. The approach to health in Portugal is still done in a stray without the necessary interaction of various health professionals on what is of paramount importance in health: the best interests of the patient. Given that, in contemporary societies, mental health has become all the more complex and troubling, with increasing prevalence. It is in our view essential to concentrate in creating sustainable alternatives, allowing not only the survival of the NHS, as well as the improvement of access to medicines and health services.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876861","Mental Health;Information Systems;Recommendations;Participation","Medical diagnostic imaging;Monitoring;Information systems;Biomedical monitoring;Proposals;Abstracts;Face","","","","34","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This reality leads to a fragmented system of storing and retrieving essential patient data that impedes optimal care leading to the coexistence of somewhat autistic systems. Providing means for scattered clinical information to be congregated where and when needed may have a strong impact on healthcare quality. Interoperability is a major requisite for effectively sharing information between systems. Standards like openEHR play an important role on achieving interoperability. Agents are software entities, which can embody different perspectives of the surrounding environment and act accordingly. They can perceive the dynamic character of the environment and update their knowledge, enabling pro-activeness regarding actions that are better suited according to a particular user and a given set of goals.

New challenges are being faced in higher education particularly in the areas of student motivation, engagement and attainment. As a result mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. Traditional methods of delivery such as lectures and tutorials need to evolve to counter these challenges with new pedagogical approaches explored including the use of new technologies. Today's students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. This paper describes a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology to develop and explore the use of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that integrates a web-based platform for the study of mathematics as part of an active learning constructivist setting. Students will utilise graphics tablets to create online content consisting of solutions to mathematical problems which will then be used by other students to reinforce core concepts. The platform will provide active support to engineering students especially those in their first year of study and mature students returning to education. It is expected that early use of the platform will help identify areas of weakness and provide the self-learning environment required for students to become more proficient in those areas. By challenging the student to demonstrate an active engagement in their learning and by encouraging the meaningful use of technology in the classroom, an improvement in the quality of learning that students experience should be realised.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876867","engineering mathematics;active learning;student engagement;student learning experience;graphics tablets","Graphics;Least squares approximations;Engineering education;Tutorials;Educational institutions","","","","11","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on the integration of new miniaturized solid-state radiation sensors: a CdZnTe detector for gamma radiation and a high efficiency neutron detector based on novel silicon technologies. The sensing unit will include a wireless communication interface to send the data remotely to a monitoring base station as well as a GPS system to calculate the position of the tag. The system will also incorporate middleware and high-level software to provide web-service interfaces for the exchange of information and an expert system to continuously analyse the information from the radiation sensor and correlate it with historical data in order to generate an alarm when an abnormal situation is detected. REWARD will be useful for many different scenarios such as nuclear terrorism threats, lost radioactive sources, radioactive contamination or nuclear accidents. It can be deployed in emergency units and in general in any type of mobile or static equipment, but also inside public/private buildings or infrastructures. The sensing units will be highly portable thanks to their low size and low energy consumption. The complete system will be scalable in terms of complexity and cost and will offer very high precision on both the measurement and the location of the radiation. REWARD's goals will be realized by the collaborative effort of eight highly specialized partners, though synergistic research organizations, wireless sensor networks providers, software developers and application users. The modularity and flexibility of the system will allow for a realistic introduction to the market. Authorities may start with a basic, low cost system and increase the complexity based on their evolving needs and budget constraints.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876872","Real Time Wide Area Radiation Surveillance System;CdZnTe detector;Neutron detector;Small;mobile;portable;modular sensing units (tags) with wireless communication interface;Scenarios ranging from nuclear terrorism threats;loss of radioactive sources to nuclear accidents","Middleware;Security;Monitoring;Neutrons;Sensor systems;Mobile communication","","","","4","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sample consisted of 20 female and 15 male older adults, divided into three groups: G1 (n = 12, 71.2 ± 7.5 years) performed traditional physical activities, such as weight lifting and dance; G2 (n = 13, 69 ± 5.8 years) did interactive activities using the Xbox Kinect (with the ‘Body and Brain Connection’ game) and made use of Spirulina platensis; and G3 (n = 10, 70.7 ± 4.8 years) undertook the same interactive activities and used a placebo. The results show that both traditional and interactive physical activities improve three parameters of functional capacity, namely aerobic endurance, agility, and balance (p ≤ 0.05). However, we found dissimilar effects in two parameters of functional capacity: there were no gains in flexibility in the three groups and there were only gains in terms of speed in G1 and G2. The intake of Spirulina platensis in G2 might be boosting the aerobic speed.

In this research, they were used with the objective of making the students design and produce Digital Educational Resources (DER), in this case vodcasts. These vodcasts covered all the curriculum content of the discipline of Geology, 12thGrade, in order to promote learning and to verify their effects on educational outcomes. To achieve these objectives we have developed, over a school year, teaching and active learning strategies, where students were asked to search, select and critically evaluate information to produce vodcasts and reflect on these processes. The vodcasts were produced taking into account some of the principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the cognitive load theory for the production of multimedia messages. Students joined with enthusiasm and commitment to this methodology and have made a very positive review, stating that this allowed them to acquire scientific and technical knowledge, develop digital and communication skills, and work in teams, in a learning environment that provided them with a high degree of freedom, personal satisfaction and autonomy. The vodcasts were inserted into a rich technological classroom environment, such as the use of Moodle and the production of ePortfolios. The results of the formal tests in this discipline were quite good (mean = 14.7 points, in a 20 points scale). When compared to the results of students in previous years, with the same teacher, who kept constant the use of Moodle and of the ePortfolio, we noticed that there was an improvement. In 2012, students that used the Blog and the ePortfolio had an average of 14.1 in formal tests and in 2011, only using ePortfolios, had an average of 13.2.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876879","active learning;active teaching;ePortfolio;multimedia learning;vodcasts","Geology;Internet;Digital audio broadcasting;Production;Blogs;Education;Multimedia communication","","","","25","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, migrating face-to-face learning methodologies to an online teaching environment is certainly challenging. More specifically, collaborative work, which provides valuable learning outcomes in classroom-based environments, is apparently unable to meet the online paradigm due to its intrinsic specificities: widely heterogeneous profiles, considerably large numbers of subscribers, scarcely balanced and doubtfully relevant feedback concerning students' progress, and poorly conducted personal attention facilities. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Sagittarius, a novel Open Educational Resource that uses data mining techniques to overcome such limitations. This open-source software enables building reliable and effective working groups in order to boost the learning experience of online courses by means of collaborative work.

Besides, the significant costs associated with these techniques implemented up to now make its worldwide spread prohibitive. The main focus of this Doctorate Thesis in Information Management is to create an automatic detection method for EFMD using distinct remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing techniques for EFMD have important applications to readily monitor illegal dumping and natural disaster outputs, and to improve rescues at sea. Moreover, marine management improvement can be easily attained not only from more efficient cost-effective EFMD detection and collection, but also from better understand the quantitative links between EFMD and marine systems health.

However, most of these tools have a configuration phase, where test input data is provided manually by the tester, which influences the quality of the test suite generated. By adding coverage analysis to MBT tools it is possible to give feedback and help the tester to define the configuration data needed to achieve the most valuable test suite as possible. This paper presents a tool, PARADIGM-COV, that produces coverage information both over the PARADIGM model elements (to assess if input data is adequate to cover the test goals and assess if preconditions are achievable), and during test case execution (to identify the parts of the model/code that were actually exercised).","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876896","software testing;test coverage analysis;model-based testing","Analytical models;Software;Measurement;Data models;Connectors;Software testing","","3","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An increasing interest is growing regarding embedded computers since they offer advantages related to portability, dedicated tasks, invisibility, amongst others. However, a plenty of hardware platforms are in the market, so it is complicated to determine which the best for a particular need. Benchmarks make those tasks easier by performing measurements in hardware by running applications and performing comparisons. Nevertheless, they are thought to meet some quite particular kinds of applications. Moreover, if some benchmark applications have to be merged, i.e. voice or images processing, there are not schemes to correctly measure hardware platforms. On the other hand, requirements such as reliability and availability are not commonly assessed as a dependant set in hardware platforms. In this work, we propose a novel method to select hardware architectures for Human Centered Computing based on benchmarking, genetic algorithms, weighted sums and statistical distances in order to consider non-functional requirements.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876901","HCC;Non Functional Requirements;Hardware Platforms;Optimization","Benchmark testing;Hardware;Vectors;Availability;Optimization;Algorithm design and analysis","","1","","36","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although many proprietary solutions have been proposed, the standard IEEE 802.15.4 is about to become the global standard for WSN, since utilizes energy-efficient schemes to access the channel, and to transmit information at low speeds. However, this standard does not have a strategy for information differentiation, in which packets from nodes with a higher priority need to be sent sooner than packets from other nodes. Consequently, this paper evaluates, by means of numerical simulations, the assumption of an information differentiation scheme, which consists in modifying the Contention Window (CW) in the slotted IEEE 802.15.4, considering that nodes with lower CW values have higher probabilities to access the channel than nodes with higher CW values. Partial results show that this information differentiation scheme increases the channel access probability, when two or three levels of CW are implemented within the network.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876903","IEEE 802.15.4;Differentiated Traffic;Contention Window","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Object oriented modeling;Multiaccess communication;Wireless sensor networks;Niobium;Energy efficiency","","","","12","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the iEcoSys system (Intelligent Ecologic System) developed by the authors. It is a technological tool that identifies the waste produced individually, using RFID tags embedded in rubbish bags - the iBags. When depositing waste, the recycling center identifies and weighs each bag and the collected data is sent to a server system using ZigBee communication standard. When the information reaches the server system, it is inserted into the database management system, making it possible to see the deposited waste in the iEcoSys Internet portal, and even order new iBags. Making the cities smarter and promote sustainability by changing the paradigm of receiving the recycled rubbish instead of paying for the waste produced, is the contribution of this study.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876904","Environment;Sustainability;MSW Management;PAYT;GAYT;Sensor Networks;Zigbee;RFID;Smart Cities","Recycling;Solids;Cities and towns;Europe;Database systems;Radiofrequency identification;Microcontrollers","","8","","16","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, irregular rainfall, coupled with the occurrence of high temperatures, are strong obstacles to the preservation and growth of plants, causing high rates of water deficiency. Recently, several systems of soil monitoring and irrigation control have been developed with the aim of improving water use efficiency. This study describes a system (iRain), developed by the authors, which aims to ensure autonomous and efficient irrigation in urban gardens. It consists of a net of sensors and actuators with Zigbee communication and control software for storage and availability of monitoring data on a web portal in real time. In manual mode, the irrigation management is the responsibility of the irrigation manager in order to control the system from the portal. In automatic mode, the system prevents watering if there is a forecast of precipitation (up to 3 days) and if the humidity of the soil has not fallen below a critical value. In this mode the decision is made at the local base. The system also gives preference to irrigation at night and during periods of light wind in order to obtain more accurate and efficient irrigation. Thus, the iRain constitutes a valuable tool for promoting sustainable use of this scarce natural resource.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876907","Environment;sustainability;sensor networks;irrigation management;sensors;Zigbee;smart cities","Irrigation;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Meteorology;Base stations","","10","","9","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The motivation of developing Hipster is the lack of standard Java search libraries with an extensible, flexible, simple to use model. Moreover, most of the libraries for search algorithms rely on recursive implementations which do not offer fine-grained control over the algorithm. Hipster provides a wide variety of classical search algorithms implemented in an iterative way like Dijkstra, A∗, IDA∗, AD∗ and more.

The aim of our research is to contribute to the multiple quadcopter simulation area introducing a platform for the design, simulation, and development of quadcopter MultiAgent Systems (MAS). Specifically for this paper, we minutely discuss the proposed architecture and present the implemented prototype focusing our experiments on the scalability and the resource usage of it. The results demonstrate that the centralised perspective limits the scalability mainly when the physical engine is being used; also, we identify that the method responsible for the 3D update is the platform's bottleneck.

This article is within the scope of the characterization of the profile of this new students, intensive user of digital technologies in their various platforms (PCs, notebooks, tablets, smartphones, digital games). Theories have been proposed in order to conceptualize the profile of this ""new student"" as well as the set of skills and cognitive, motivational and emotional competencies arising therefrom. Among these, we highlight the concepts of ""digital natives"" and ""digital generation"", terms that refer to the generation of intensively socialized individuals from early childhood in the use of digital technologies. In recent years these types come under fire since the impact of digital technologies is mostly due to the type, usage context and motivation of different users, rather than to age and gender. The objective of this paper is to discuss the main criticisms of these typologies, from the notion of ""visitors"" and ""resident"" digital. Besides the theoretical discussion exploratory research with 127 adolescents from Rio de Janeiro, aged between 11 and 19 years, of both sexes, aimed at mapping the types, motivations and contexts of use of digital technologies in their daily lives was performed. A questionnaire as a method of data collection was used. The results obtained corroborated overcoming the initial concept of digital natives, indicating the variety and multiplicity of levels of engagement and use of digital technologies are crucial variables for this use factors such as availability, interest and mastery of these technologies and their respective platforms.

Nevertheless, the potential of ubiquitous computation in order to promote social integration of citizens with impairments is focused and elucidated. The benefits of applying so much effort on accessibility as well as on usability is asserted and related to universal design. Hence, in order to promote a more universal applications development, the mobile operating systems available in the market, which are more plausible to be chosen and used by people with impairments, are scrutinized and shown from a standpoint of a developer that has accessibility and usability concerns.

However, this is not a trivial task: the large number of parameters to be taken into account to generate heterogeneous groups in a class is a key parameter that increases the complexity of the task. Currently, this process of group allocation is manually solved by the teaching staff; an individual profile analysis is performed for each student and then each one is assigned to a particular group, which can take more than a week of work when the number of students is around 120.

In this sense, the learning and the teaching process have to take such developments into account. As a consequence the teaching profession is evolving from an emphasis on delivering information to an emphasis on creating learning environments [2]. Indeed, the new challenges related with the integration of ITE into all aspects of the learning process require revising the traditional educational paradigms that have been prevailed for last years. Thus, on the one hand, the theoretical framework of this paper is based on literature about information technologies, in general, and information technologies in higher education, in particular. On the other hand, the empirical framework reflects the best practices in this field used in the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda (IPG, Portugal).

This test is part of a methodological approach that aims at the creation of a framework coined SPEED (Simulation of Pedestrians and Elicitation of their Emergent Dynamics). A population sample of 22 subjects was used to test such a methodological approach, which consists in having the subjects answering a questionnaire and later on, in playing a Serious Game. The game environment presents the same scenarios shown in the questionnaire using more elaborated 3D rendering to provide players with a sense of realism. The game was developed under the Unity3D game engine and based on the Serious Games concept. Preliminary results are promising, showing that the challenge made players think about the various situations that might happen when facing an emergency. They are also implied to reason on their stream of decisions, such as which direction to take considering the environment and some adverse situations, such as smoke, fire and people running on the opposite direction of the emergency signalling.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876951","serious games;way-finding;emergency planning;building evacuation;human behaviour elicitation","Games;Fires;Buildings;Sociology;Statistics;Training","","8","","25","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This language has a lexicon, plus syntactic and semantic rules such as any oral language. This work's motivation was based primarily on two aspects: the PSL qualified interpreters are scarce, and the most common digital method to present sign language, namely the video with humans, it is a difficult medium to edit and reuse. After said that, it makes perfectly sense to use a deaf-signer virtual human capable of reproduce this language. With the advent of the Microsoft Kinect, the motion capture sessions turn out to be a easiest and more accessible process than the conventional systems. Our research involves this low-cost technology to support the animation of a virtual human. This paper describes an application within the education domain, which uses an avatar as a PSL virtual interpreter. The virtual signer objective is to teach basic concepts of PSL in a fun and easy manner, targeted especially to children. The tool allows the translation of Portuguese words to PSL, it allows to combine signs into simple sentences, and also illustrates several grammatical concepts such as: negative or interrogative sentence construction; gender and plural marking; and verbal time conjunction. It was included as well, a didactic component to test the user's knowledge, through a simple game of association between words and signs. The evaluation results shows that the application could contribute to the PSL education, and shows that avatars are useful in the sign language context.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876959","Portuguese sign language;PSL;avatar;animation;motion capture;children;education;Kinect","Avatars;Visualization;Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Software;Education;Animation","","5","","27","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New methods demand new organisation alternatives that, in turn, require new educational policies and put pressure in current assumptions of education itself. Distance Education is a challenge by itself. It places new demands both to the learner, but also to the facilitator. A set of seven dimensions for a distance learning environment were identified, which positively impacts the setting of learning experiences: (1) access tools; (2) technology experience; (3) habits and study skills; (4) human factors and life style; (5) goals and guidelines; (6) learning preferences; (7) personal characteristics [1]. This paper defends that the learners, when asked about their characteristics, taking into account different issues of their familiar, personal and professional life, available technology resources, technology skills, as well as motivation and learning preferences, provide an information set that, if turn available to facilitators, allow to both players (learners and facilitators) the mechanisms that ease the adoption of learning strategies, that enhance the possibility of a well succeed learning experience. To accomplish the research goals, an empiric study was conducted in the context of a Distance Education (DE) institution, taking a sample of 214 learners, with diverse characteristics. The data analysis allows the confirmation of the position validity and proves that it is possible to know in advance the distance learners more important characteristics and of the surrounding environment as means to access potential success and rate failure. Based on such knowledge it is possible to establish a classification of those characteristics, suggesting strategies and counseling to support decisions and thus to improve the distance learning success.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876960","Distance Learning;Learners characteristics","Computer aided instruction;Context;Instruments;Educational institutions;Sociology;Statistics","","1","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of the availability of these technological resources, we seldom find pedagogical practices grounded upon institutional guidelines which make the best of these tools. This is partly due to the fact that leaderships don't always have a clear and objective perception, as well as a quantitative perspective supported by indicators, of the subject. This entails leaderships are not able to portray accurately and promptly the performance of these technological policies in schools. School leaderships should point directions that lead to the proficient use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) so as to pave way for a educational paradigm shift that reflects a new conception of teaching and learning. In this context, it is the aim of this investigation to identify the necessary information that should be collected as well as the proper models and instruments for data collection that support the decision-makers in adopting adequate measures to the educational contexts of each school community. Hopefully, this contribution will aid in the setting of new paths for the development of information systems applied in educational settings, indicating functional organics for the automatic, systematic and systemic collection of indicators that support the decision-making process as far as technological policies in educational contexts are concerned. Among these stages are the review and estimate of investments, training necessities, supervision practices, partnership needs and the change in suppliers. The present paper was elaborated as part of a Doctoral Degree program in Educational Leadership by the Portuguese institution Universidade Aberta Portuguesa, in the context of the project “Teaching Procedures, Technology and Innovation in Alternative Educational Measures”, integrated in the third dimension which comprises the problematic regarding the integration and use of technology in the educational intervention and learning outcomes.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876983","innovation;information and communication technology;information systems;indicators;leadership","Instruments;Lead;Internet;Educational institutions;Context;Information systems","","","","15","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The management of these volumes, from capture, storage, search, transfer, analysis and visualization, still provides interesting challenges. One critical task is the efficient retrieval of data (raw data or intermediate results from analytic tools). Previous work proposed the TravelLight method which reduced the turnaround time and improved interactive retrieval of data from large temporal datasets by exploring the temporal consistency of records in a database. In this work we propose improvements to the method by adopting a new paradigm focused in the management of time intervals instead of solely in data items. A major advantage of this paradigm shift is to enable the separation of the method implementation from any particular temporal data source, as it is autonomous and efficient in the management of retrieved data. Our work demonstrates that the overheads introduced by the new paradigm are smaller than prior overall overheads, further reducing the turnaround time. Reported results concern experiments with a temporally linear navigation across two datasets of one million items. With the obtained results it is possible to conclude that the improvements presented in this work further reduce turnaround time thus enhancing the response of interactive tasks over very large temporal datasets.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876986","large datasets;temporal data;time-oriented data;data retrieval;self-balancing interval tree","Data structures;Memory management;Algorithm design and analysis;Data visualization;Databases;Complexity theory;Testing","","4","","8","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the Spanish case, where large corporations are not the majority of the business, but are SMEs [5], an approach of this kind raises the question not only about CEOs but about the entire chain of command. The principle that all agents involved in a process of outreach contribute to this projection is applied [4]. This work in progress (short paper) focuses on the variation of the point of view when considering the different hierarchical levels of the chain of command. The study across 4 categories (CEO or Director, Senior manager, Middle management, technical staff) revealed homogeneous general trends but at the same time some specific differences which had to be taken into consideration.

Para grande parte destes casos existe uma dificuldade acrescida, não só em encontrar o dono do animal, mas também em reunir os esforços de inúmeros voluntários que, de uma forma ou outra, pretendem ajudar. De forma facilitar a procura de animais perdidos, foi proposto disponibilizar uma aplicação móvel em iOS, que permite a um utilizador colocar anúncios sobre animais perdidos e/ou encontrados, com base na localização onde foram vistos pela última vez. A aplicação serve igualmente de apoio à busca do animal. Sendo este um serviço que foca principalmente o senso comum e o espírito de entreajuda, torna-se importante notificar o utilizador no seu dia a dia, em situações em que ele pode ser verdadeiramente útil sem prejudicar, por exemplo, o seu itinerário. Por isso, foi criado um sistema de alertas que avisa o utilizador, ao passar numa determinada rua, quais os anúncios atuais na sua proximidade.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876991","GPS;smartphone;aplicação móvel;anúncios;notificações;crowdsourcing","Animals;Global Positioning System;Twitter;Facebook;Crowdsourcing;Portals;Ground penetrating radar","","","","7","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not feasible to analyze a significant number of documents in a short time without the support of a computational tool. The Information Extraction aims to extract from textual documents only the relevant information defined by the user. This information can be mapped and classified in the field of health through ontologies. This paper proposes the design of an information extracting mechanism that, in a hybrid form, can combine: an extractor for textual documents; the construction and use of a domain ontology for evidence-based nursing, aiming to assist in the classification of documents which will be extracted by the extractor and in the representation of this domain with respect to the computational area.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876992","information extraction;ontology;text classification;evidence-based nursing","Data mining;Ontologies;Information retrieval;Medical services;Internet;Abstracts;Media","","","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a synchronization model based on message digests to synchronize relational databases between mobile devices and a server, in order to minimize the data transferred between the device and the server and to minimize the processing done by the mobile device. The approach consists in a synchronization model where the amount of data to be exchanged has been reduced to the minimum. In order to achieve the model above a registry is done in the device with the new, the modified or removed content, which purpose is to send only the essential data for synchronization from the device to the server. Regarding the synchronization from the server to the device, the modifications are calculated and sent to the device. This model is independent of proprietary solutions and can be adapted to any system or platform, often involving software development to the mobile application and the application server. The results of testing the model show that the proposed model can achieve better synchronization times than the competitor models, while always fulfilling the set objectives.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876996","Mobile Devices;Synchronization;Relational Database;Mobile Database","Synchronization;Servers;Databases;Mobile handsets;Mobile communication;Data models;Business","","6","","15","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different States have incorporated this practice as a way of optimizing their resources. Therefore, software acquisitions require public calls for software tenders. Unfortunately, in Latin-American countries and, specially in their local governments, there are software projects formulated under conditions which seriously affect the success of these projects. In this paper we use the metaphor of the “brave new world” in order to close an empirical approach to the “real world”. We present a set of rules to be applied in e-government projects. These rules have been compiled from a set of expert “survivors” in the software market in a developing country. The goal is twofold, firstly, to propose a quick guide of non-functional requirements for e-government projects and, secondly, to show how using a literary metaphor allows to justify an epistemological position to empower the experience value of their original actors.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6876999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876999","e-government;software biddings;non-functional requirements;outsourcing","Software;Silicon;Silicon compounds;Electronic government;Outsourcing;Abstracts;Industries","","1","","13","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite all the problems, it is understood that the country is trying hard to improve the quality of its elections, which includes using electronic voting (e-voting). However, the claim on how Indonesia is ready to implement e-voting in its presidential election is considered baseless, or at least is believed to be premature. There are many issues that need to be firstly addressed, such as infrastructure unreadiness, people's reluctance to accept the technology, and lacks of standard and framework prior to the implementation; before jumping into conclusion that the country needs the technology. This paper argues on the needs for a thorough study on e-voting and serves as a preliminary towards a standard and framework for implementing the technology in Indonesia. It looks at the problems lingering the country's previous elections and the issues with implementing e-voting in Indonesia. This paper suggests that such study should see through the perspective of development research. Finally, it proposes a framework that urges the application of participatory processes and promotes iterative development work.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877000","electronic voting;e-voting Indonesia;e-voting standard and framework;Indonesia's presidential election","Electronic voting;Nominations and elections;Context;Internet;Standards","","2","","41","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to access such tools via mobile interfaces is increasing in importance, particularly with the rise in power of mobile hardware. Yet, in the field of real-time 3D graphics, progress is hampered by both the lack of cross-platform software compatibility (particularly lack of mobile browser WebGL support), and by lower hardware performance for certain plaforms, especially mobile. In this paper, we analyze the barriers for developing cross-platform 3D graphics technology and, based on this analysis, present a suitable cross-platform pipeline that allows the viewing and editing of real-time 3D scenes in a collaborative environment. We compare a mobile implementation of this pipeline with a WebGL-based engine for desktop use, and present and discuss results on the differences between these two implementations. We further demonstrate a system for collaborative 3D scene creation using our pipeline with a custom plugin for the modeling software Autodesk Maya.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877014","3D;graphics;WebGL;Editor;Pipeline;Modelling;Collaborative","Three-dimensional displays;Pipelines;Collaboration;Mobile communication;Engines;Rendering (computer graphics);Solid modeling","","","","13","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Informants suggested that the extent to which the client and vendor understand each others' expectations is crucial to using ITIL effectively, as are knowledge sharing and other aspects of good communication. This is also consistent with a further study of 83 ITIL users' experience. However, informants observed that it can take time before ITIL processes are fully understood and incorporated into practice. The paper concludes that where ITIL practices and principles are internalized into the day-to-day processes and behaviours of the firm (and its IT culture) the greatest benefits will be obtained.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877020","IT outsourcing;IT outsourcing relationship;ITIL;Maturity model of ITIL","Outsourcing;Organizations;Standards organizations;Information technology;Educational institutions;Information systems","","3","","23","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, it is particularly relevant the online availability of data which would allow citizens to make public officials accountable for their actions (transparency for accountability). One important issue concerning online transparency assessment is to know which data should be made available in public sector entities web sites in order to facilitate the accountability process. In general, research literature selects such required data according to legal requirements and international standards (such as those from public sector accounting), thus not taking into consideration the requirements of ordinary citizens as ultimate recipients of accountability related information. To close this gap, and considering the role of journalists as information brokers, a qualitative content analysis was performed on news from three Portuguese newspapers published in a month period. The analysis resulted in the identification of a set of relevant information items for public debate concerning the actions of public officials, from a journalistic point of view. This set of items might be used not only as a baseline for conducting public entities online transparency assessment exercises, but also to guide the development of new integrated platforms aiming at facilitating citizens' access to transparency for accountability data.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877029","eGovernment;open government;transparency;accountability","Portals;Electronic government;Local government;Internet;Europe;Context","","","","23","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main function for a Flapper valve of a Fuller-Kinyon type M pump is to prevent that the air generated to convey the bulk material through a conveying pipe flows inside of the material chute through the rotating screw. If this will occur, the material flow will decrease or even stop, causing a reduction of the pump capacity. Thus, it is necessary to maintain calibrated each flapper valve in the plant. This process of maintenance is done ten times per month, or when necessary, and it needs the pump to be shut down, taking up to two hours to finish the complete process. For this reason, an augmented reality application is being developed, aiming to reduce the consumed time by the maintenance process. Using this application, it is expected to dedicate less time training the new personnel responsible for the maintaining process, displaying tridimensional models, animations, images and text information that would simplify the instructions shown in a printed manual and adding an interactive environment between the users and the information displayed. A mobile device either a tablet or a smartphone is to be used as the hardware that will run the application, allowing the user to take it right to the working area, either in a workshop or directly in field. The information displayed includes CAD models of the pump and its components as well as animations illustrating the instructions to follow in each step of the process. Also, the right tool to use in each step will be indicated following by security warnings when needed. This project was developed from knowledge and experiences gathered among the different previous AR projects developed at ITESM.

As a result of this interest, several studies and theories have been applied to this field, mainly to larger companies, and with a lesser application to the universe of small businesses. Portuguese business context is mainly composed by owner managed companies of the small businesses. The theoretical support that was considered most appropriate to back the analysis was the trade-off theory. The trade-off theory, in general terms, explains the amount of cash reported by companies on their balance sheets. This study is based on a sample of Portuguese manufacturing firms. It uses a methodology of econometric nature, based on models that were constructed to test if the tradeoff theory can explain the amount of cash held by these companies. The modeling considered four key variables (determinants) significant in the explanation of such amounts: the ""net working capital"", the ""debt"", the ""size"" and ""cash flow"". Moreover, after a closer analysis, the results indicate that there are significant differences when if there is or not an auditor that certifies the accounts of the companies is added as control.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877054","cash balances;manufacturing;portuguese micro-enterprises;trade-off theory","Companies;Manufacturing;Context;Econometrics;Biological system modeling;Bills of materials","","","","14","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most countries rely on surveillance systems to monitor the status of the epidemic which are based on cases notification by physicians. It can take several months until the diagnosed cases are notified and there are even cases that are not reported at all. The purpose of this paper is to adjust the Portuguese notification data to these main possible biasing problems. For the reporting delay we will use the traditional conditional likelihood estimation for count data assuming a Poisson distribution. For the cases that are not reported at all, we will use a mixture of Poisson distributions, based on natural conjugate prior distributions, and estimate the unknown parameters through maximum likelihood. The Poisson model suggests that approximately 80% of the Portuguese AIDS cases were reported within one year after the diagnosis and that the majority of cases were notified in the first three months. The BB/NBD model suggests that the probability of a new AIDS case being notified gets higher once a large amount of AIDS cases has been notified.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877056","Reporting Delay;Underreporting;HIV/AIDS;Portuguese Notification System;Count Data;Poisson Regression;BB/NBD Model","Delays;Human immunodeficiency virus;Mathematical model;Data models;Surveillance;Europe","","3","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All the work presented here was based on two premises: the use of Scratch as a tool and the students as producers of media, which in turn developed their creativity, problem solving skills, and augmented their media literacy and critical thinking aptitude. In this plan of action, we considered three phases: in the 1st phase we evaluated several methodologies for introducing Scratch; in the 2nd phase we focused on collaborative learning in small groups; in the 3rd phase the focus was on developing a game with the whole class. For the duration of this study, it was noticeable that the group of students easily adapted to Scratch. We concluded that the use of this tool motivates students and improves the learning process. It also contributes to a higher level of concentration and promotes collaborative learning. Additionally, it facilitates creativity, dialogue and the overall relationship among students. The teacher quickly understood that this tool allowed the shift into a pedagogic model based on the collaborative construction of knowledge.

Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising communication method within nanonetworks, since using electromagnetic waves is not very likely due to the size of the nanomachines. In molecular communication, information is encoded onto molecules at senders and the molecules propagate to receivers in a controlled manner. This control is one of the most important challenges, and this paper will describe some solutions for molecular communication. Since molecular communication offers means to transport information-encoded molecules to receivers and allows biological and artificially-created components to communicate with each other, future applications for health care are discussed in this paper. Results are obtained from computerized simulation scenarios selecting appropriate parameters for optimal performance.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877070","Molecular;Communication;Simulation;Nanothings;Nanonetwork;Nanomachines;Nanomedicine;Endocrine","Nanobioscience;Molecular communication;Receivers;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;Monitoring;Transmitters","","","","25","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is not just things connected to the Internet - it is intelligent systems that we will be able to build on top of IoT that will introduce us to a better quality of life. However, IoT is facing a major problem: fragmentation and interoperability problems. If we want things to communicate with each other, intelligently and autonomously, then the new future Internet must be structured to allow such thing. The industry must adopt current standards and provide interoperability among other systems and developers must be aware of this issue too. Every new device should be IoT proof for future integration in IoT. In this article, there is a focus on these health-related use cases where they are detailed and explained how IoT could be deployed to aid in specific cases.

But experience is essential in under-standing the problems and especially their solutions. A real software project is difficult to practice because of its long duration and the potential of high damage if the project fails. Simulation games in a sandbox are a well-known approach for practicing complex content. But the design and development of such a game needs much knowledge about all the relevant processes that should be simulated. In this paper, we propose a general framework and a method that can be used for developing project management simulation games for an educational purpose in the software engineering domain. We developed a general simulation model including aspects of ergonomic analysis, work psychology, learning theory and software engineering. With this, we are able to simulate not only the working processes but also the character of the developers. It can be used without understanding the simulation model, so there is no need to understand all the complex content behind. Considering existing solutions, our approach supports different types of games, without making limitations to the game design. We show that with adequate abstraction there is no need to develop an own simulation model for each simulation game. Instead, all relevant aspects can be integrated in a general simulation model.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877074","Simulation;Simulation Game;MABS;Project Management;Software Engineering Education;Experiential Learning","Games;Object oriented modeling;Software;Software engineering;Education;Context;Project management","","4","","15","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To change this, biofeedback techniques using physiological sensors are being studied as possible replacements for traditional videogame interaction devices. In this paper, we continue on-going research by introducing unimodal and, for the first time, multimodal biofeedback game mechanics aiming at enhanced depth and expanded game design possibilities. We developed a First-Person Shooter to test these concepts against traditional unimodal mechanisms, and conducted an empirical study with 32 players. Both unimodal and multimodal variants provided high levels of fun to players, with subtle differences suggesting that these types are best leveraged depending on the interaction context on which they are applied.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877078","Biofeedback;direct biofeedback;multimodal biofeedback;unimodal biofeedback;game design;games;physical computing;physiology;physiological control","Games;Biological control systems;Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Physiology;Mice;Artificial intelligence","","2","","19","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New challenges are being faced in higher education particularly in the areas of student motivation, engagement and attainment. As a result mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. Traditional methods of delivery such as lectures and tutorials need to evolve to counter these challenges with new pedagogical approaches explored including the use of new technologies. Today's students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. This paper describes a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology to develop and explore the use of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that integrates a web-based platform for the study of mathematics as part of an active learning constructivist setting. Students will utilise graphics tablets to create online content consisting of solutions to mathematical problems which will then be used by other students to reinforce core concepts. The platform will provide active support to engineering students especially those in their first year of study and mature students returning to education. It is expected that early use of the platform will help identify areas of weakness and provide the self-learning environment required for students to become more proficient in those areas. By challenging the student to demonstrate an active engagement in their learning and by encouraging the meaningful use of technology in the classroom, an improvement in the quality of learning that students experience should be realised.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877081","engineering mathematics;active learning;student engagement;student learning experience;graphics tablets","Graphics;Least squares approximations;Engineering education;Tutorials;Educational institutions","","","","11","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A comparison was made between the data received from the software's modules that could be used for auditing purposes and the data on which the auditing techniques were applied after extracting and tutor-oriented evaluations were performed. The evaluations regarding the monitoring, assessing and managing of the teaching process in the activities of the Networked PBL of Moodle software's auditing function were made in consideration of the findings. It was concluded that Moodle was sufficient for meeting the basic data requirements for educational auditing, its modules alone did not have Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) function; a CAATs add-in, which would be created or used for fulfilling the educational requirements, would be useful.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877087","networked learning;problem based learning;e-PBL;teacher training;NPBL;auditing","Education;Software;Least squares approximations;Correlation coefficient;Computers;Data mining;Monitoring","","","","10","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper focused specifically on the use of audit sampling and computer assisted audit techniques (CAATs). The focus of the paper was the banking sector in South Africa. The increasing volumes of transactions that are processed by banks on a daily basis necessitated the internal audit function to adopt strategies in order to obtain audit evidence in a cost efficient manner in the execution of its mandate to senior management and the board of directors. The results derived from the paper indicated that audit sampling is still used more frequently compared to the use of CAATs. An anticipated decline in the use of audit sampling is however expected with an increase in the use of CAATs in the coming years. In addition, all the respondents indicated that the adoption and implementation of CAATs in their audit methodology is a priority within the next 12 months.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877088","Internal audit;CAATs;Chief Audit Executive;Non-statistical sampling;Statistical sampling;Tests of controls","Sociology;Statistics;Banking;Business;Standards;Testing","","4","","28","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although hundreds of experimental studies are achieved especially for English, which is a non-agglutinative language, the number of efforts for Turkish, which is one of the most popular agglutinative languages in the world, is counted something on the fingers of one hand. Therefore, a solution is sought for Turkish spam e-mail problem taking the special characteristics of Turkish e-mails into consideration. The developed spam filtering framework has four components named as morphological decomposition, feature selection, training, and test phases. A fixed-prefix stemming approach is used to extract the features of an e-mail and then the Mutual Information (MI) method is carried out as the feature selection method. The Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers are employed and the recognition accuracies obtained from these methods are considerably satisfactory. The highest accuracy rates are 91.08% for ANN and 87.67% for DT methods when the dimensions of feature vectors are selected as 150×5) and (75×5), respectively.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877092","Spam;legitimate;e-mail;mutual information;artificial neural networks;decision tree","Artificial neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Text categorization;Unsolicited electronic mail","","2","","21","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clustering ensemble has emerged as a potent approach for ameliorating both the forcefulness and the stability of unsupervised classification results. One of the major problems in clustering ensembles is to find the best consensus function. Finding final partition from different clustering results requires skillfulness and robustness of the classification algorithm. In addition, the major problem with the consensus function is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is due to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a novel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks technique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach is used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the quality of databases. This can generates good results and efficient data partitions. To show its effectiveness, we support our strategy with empirical evaluation using distorted speech from Aurora speech databases.","2166-0727","978-9-8998-4343-1","10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877093","","Databases;Noise measurement;Speech;Clustering algorithms;Noise;Maintenance engineering;Robustness","","","","17","","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
