Toward a model for tracking bank internal audits: A solution framed on the multidimensional modeling approach
ABSTRACT
Audit activities are the way to determinate and guarantee the efficiency of operational and financial quality of organizations in general, and bank institutions in particular. As so, empowering audit teams with systematic measures which the application is supported by a technological tool that allows to plan, carry out and guide audit actions with a continuity perspective is the overall objective of this work.

It was an output of this work the development of a prototype of an illustrative tool. However, the conception process are out of this paper scope. For validation purpose one relied on a questionnaire that was submitted to auditing technicians, allowing to assess the created model on its usefulness.
