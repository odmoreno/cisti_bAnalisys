Curricular integration of ICT in non-university education levels: Model of adjustment and roadmap
ABSTRACT
In the context of non-university regulated education, from a detailed work we have done, we found the problem that there are a curriculum to teach and there are, also, some ICT resources that we can be used for teaching such content, or pretensions to design ICT resources for them, but there is no nothing to link the contents of the different areas, of the curriculum, with ICT resources is to design for themselves and with existing resources. This article proposes a solution using a model of curricular integration of ICT, characterized by providing the necessary adjustment between software and ICT resources and curriculum. The model supports a technology solution from a catalog of curricular educations intentions related to ICT (CIEC-tic), from which it enables the modeling of Didactic Units, so as to integrate the resources of the Learning Object Repository by a curricular focus mainly. It explains the model and proposes a roadmap for the same.
