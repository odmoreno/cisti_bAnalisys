Economic growth and internet access in developing countries: The case of South America
ABSTRACT
The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of internet access on the economic growth in ten countries of South America in the period 1996-2016. For that, a panel data model was used in addition of some covariates (some of them instrumental variables). Results show the existence of a positive correlation between access to the internet and the variation of GDP (when considering instrumental variables, it is shown greater robustness in the model).
