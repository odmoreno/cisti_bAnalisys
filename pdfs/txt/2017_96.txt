Automation of standardized usability questionnaire for iOS mobile platform
ABSTRACT
Usability is one of the factors that determine the success of a system. To improve it is necessary to evaluate the interfaces using evaluation methods. Often the results of these evaluations are different when performed by different people, indicating lack of sistematicity and predictability of evaluation results. Questionnaires are methods used to collect opinions of the users about the usability of a system, and can be automated. This paper analyze the possibility of automating one standardized usability questionnaire for further automation. A bibliographical research was carried out about the concepts of Human-Computer Interaction, usability, usability evaluation methods, automation and usability questionnaires and a systematic review was conducted to identify automated usability questionnaires. No automated standardized usability questionnaires were found. The Post-Study Systems Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was chosen to be automated because is small, free and highly reliable. Analysis of the users and specification of the system requirements and architecture were made.
