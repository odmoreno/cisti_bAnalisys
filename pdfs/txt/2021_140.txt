Performance Comparison of the Trajectory Execution Between 2 and 4 DOF Caudal Fin of a Fish Robot
ABSTRACT
This document contemplated the implementation of an autonomous robotic fish multilink of two degrees of freedom, by caudal fin propulsion that, according to propulsive mechanisms employed by fish, propels itself using lateral oscillations. A performance comparison was made between the fish of 2 links and one of 4 links in caudal fin, whose stability and maneuverability were evaluated based on the Schiehlen method for multibody systems. The structurally proposed fish is composed as an open system of two links with a rigid head, flexible rear body and the mobile caudal fin. Finally, the experiments and results regarding the swimming obtained are exposed by observing the oscillatory movement and the functionality of its caudal fin to meet the displacement on linear trajectories.
