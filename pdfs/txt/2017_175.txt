Monitoring of urban dynamics using LiDAR data: Case study of a sector in Bogotá — Colombia
ABSTRACT
This article aims to propose a methodology to monitor the urban dynamics using LIDAR data. The study area corresponds to 12.5ha in the urban sector called Sucre, in the city of Bogotá (Colombia). The methodology proposes the classification and filtering of LiDAR data (acquired in 2009) for the identification of the points corresponding to the soil (which represent the digital terrain model - DTM) and to the buildings (which represent the digital building model - DBM). The digital models created from the LiDAR data are compared with the 3D model created from the reference data corresponding to the cadastral information made by the Cadastre of the city in 2011 (data available at IDECA). Results show three zones of change where new buildings can be evidenced, which were revised using Google Street Maps®. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the methodology for the generation of the volumetry of the city from LiDAR data is an alternative to arrive at the modeling of the reality that is expected in Cadastre 2034.
