Management of Animals on Farms : A BLE-based solution
ABSTRACT
Since nomadic peoples, livestock farming has been one of the forms of human subsistence that allowed for an increase in the quality of life of societies. This activity has, however, under-gone changes about the size of herds, as well as production methods. Currently, there is a massive implementation of technology at the service of agriculture, allowing the automatic acquisition of in-formation and the consequent processing of it, enabling faster and more assertive decision making. These developments are also a reality increasingly present in livestock where the technology al-ready developed allows not only help in management, but also to know the health status of animals. The Animark LESS system is characterized by a low-cost solution that allows monitoring the presence of animals in the herd, with good contributions to animal welfare. The proposed system was tested in a goat farm.
