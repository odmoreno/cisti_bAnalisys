Implementation of virtual worlds in distance studies
ABSTRACT
Nowadays there is a growing interest in the use of virtual reality environments because through immersive education participants can be offered a feeling of “being there”, through a synchronous connection that allows them to communicate with a sense of presence. The present work shows the methodology that we used for the implementation of Virtual Worlds (MV). It was developed with OpenSimulator for two subjects of a Distance education system in order to facilitate real practices of judicial hearings. It is exposed as a tactical alternative in the teaching-learning process; in addition, the results obtained are exposed when evaluating the methodology through the use and functionality of the virtual environment by students, teachers and technicians of university centers. The results indicate that 25% of students consider between difficult and very difficult to move within the MV, despite the 75% of students exposed the interaction within the MV was easy and very easy; so that, they mention that it is of great functionality due to the benefits obtained in terms of improving communication with other users and the immediacy of responses; 70% of the technicians participating in the tests were not inconvenienced, while the teachers considered very entertaining how the practice was carried out in the MV.
