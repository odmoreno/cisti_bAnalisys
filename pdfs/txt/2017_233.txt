A simplified method to enhance the analysis for new information systems in corporate environments
ABSTRACT
The impact of efficient Information System Strategy Plans has proven crucial to modern-day corporations. However, during the analysis phase for a technical solution to fulfil an identified need in an enterprise, many teams tend to focus on a very issue-specific analysis and overlook its underlying global corporate impacts. On the other hand, it is difficult and time-expensive for these teams to analyse every existing corporate solution and how they are affected by their technical decisions. Moreover, such analysis still represents a significant organisational risk. To reduce such risks and perform a more efficient analysis we propose a simple method that considers an initial high-level analysis, focusing on the most common requirements of an enterprise in what concerns its Information Systems.
