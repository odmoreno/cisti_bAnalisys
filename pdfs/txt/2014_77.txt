Extension of the Brazilian Federal government Budget ontology to support the representation of geolocated human development indicators
ABSTRACT
This paper proposes an extension to the Ontology of the Brazilian Federal Budget, available today as Open Data, in order to integrate to this ontology geolocation concepts that enable decision making in the budgetary field, considering the regional characteristics of the country. The proposed extension involves the transformation of relational data representing locators which are key elements of the budget data model, linking them to the concept of geo-regions of Brazil, so as to use those locators in the composition of RDF triples published as open data. To evaluate the effect of this addition, this paper analyzes the results obtained by consulting locators related to education and health, comparing the obtained rates with those of the trends extracted from the corresponding Human Development Index, and concluding with a trend analysis regarding the regionalized allocation of budgetary resources.
