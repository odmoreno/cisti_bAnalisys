Metaverse: : an analysis of the conceptual structure
ABSTRACT
Metaverse is a compound word combining meta (beyond; transcending) and verse (the root of the universe; cosmos; the whole world), which denotes a new virtual universe created beyond the real world. This paper aims to explore the conceptual structure of the metaverse from a Web of Science (WoS) database search and metadata analysis using the R-Bibliometrix package. This research identified the following performance indicators: most relevant sources, corresponding authors’ country, most cited countries, word cloud extracted from WoS subject categories, and cumulative dynamics of authors’ keywords. The conceptual structure analysis used the following features: thematic map of authors’ keywords; thematic evolution of authors’ keywords; and factor analysis using the multiple correspondence analysis method. It is concluded that the metaverse will merge the virtual and physical worlds and create a new engagement model based on several emerging technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and edge computing.
