Detection of moving objects through color thresholding
ABSTRACT
In image processing area and segmentation algorithms based on thresholding, the intensity of the image (grayscale) is usually obtained in order to differentiate the regions of the objects and the background. The segmentation based on the threshold works well when the image has a high intensity in the contrast, this characteristic is key to make a good classification of the pixels. This document will explain some theoretical concepts to identify objects by means of their color (thresholding), this technique was implemented in the development of a game program. Furthermore, the thresholding range for the red, yellow and green colors was found in order to achieve a better approach in the object detection. This project used the python programming language, Pygame graphical interface libraries and the OpenCV library free open source about artificial vision.
