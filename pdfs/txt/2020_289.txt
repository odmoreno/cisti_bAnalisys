Technologies and Senior Population: Challenges and Opportunities
ABSTRACT
This article aims to identify the factors that limit the adoption of information and communication technologies by the senior population. Through a questionnaire with a convenience sample type, applied to 102 people over 65 years old in the Lisbon region, it was possible to understand the difficulties that the senior population feels when using ICT and to understand the relationship of the elderly with ICT. Age, low qualification and lack of perception of benefits are presented as the main factors that limit the use of technology. It has become important to analyze the policies and initiatives that have been developed to try to combat the digital exclusion in the senior population, and which of the initiatives developed had the greatest impact in reducing the difficulties experienced by them, such as training sessions and support from teachers and family.
