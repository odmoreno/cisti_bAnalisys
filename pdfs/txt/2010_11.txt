Architecting multimedia-rich collaborative learning services over Interactive Digital TV
ABSTRACT
Distance learning has developed greatly in recent years, and several major technological approaches have been defined. One of these is t-learning, that is, the provision of educational services over Interactive Digital TV. In this paper, we present a Java-based software architecture for the development of distributed t-learning applications and services, based on freely available technologies. The proposed framework provides convenient support for the specific needs of t-learning with strong emphasis on interactivity, promoting the creation of student communities and shared workspaces on a peer-to-peer basis. We also introduce a CASE tool for visual development of such services, distributing their functionality among a number of sceneries that provide for differentiated roles among those in a community.
