A developemnt model of units of learning for multiple platforms
ABSTRACT
The need to ensure flexibility, compatibility, interoperability and reduce costs of production and maintenance of resources can be obtained with the use of internationally recognised specifications as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), IEEE Learning Object Metadata (IEEE LOM) or Instructional Management System-Learning Design (IMS-LD). In this way, the research aims to verify whether a development model of Units of learning (UoL) based on open source online tools for authoring and execution of UoLs, that meet the criteria of usability and without deep knowledge of programming language by developers provide effectively increased implementation or the re-use of UAs complete or parts in different Electronic Learning Systems (ELS). For this, we intend to conduct a survey of authoring tools or editors and players to perform an analysis of competitors in order to identify the potential, general operating characteristics. Thus, to perform the surveys will be used as collection instruments: questionnaires and interviews with samples from groups of users and developers of educational content. Already the evaluations of the tool developed will be carried out by groups of users that include samples of all those in potential, in order to ensure the production of reusable content. Therefore, it is expected that the authoring tool and your player can assist in the development of UoLs for different ELS from a lean and simple semantics, which facilitates and ensures interoperability, changes, adjustments, maintenance and reuse of the UoLs.
