The educational technology of radio in the European Union
ABSTRACT
The radio in the Internet has reshaped the way in which listeners access program content, directly influencing the communicative and educational relationship between the audience and the broadcasters. In these arguments, in vogue in the international academic scene, the need arises to understand the bases that ground to collective discourse, its hybrid thoughts and identities. As a result, we obtained, through this discourse analysis, a sample supported by ideologies that are influenced by historical and social factors in Portugal and Spain, based on qualitative research.
