Monitoring and automation of the water pumping and storage process applied to a water treatment plant
ABSTRACT
In Drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), mainly those that are in the rural area, your pumping operations are done manually. However, the consequences of a human error in these tasks can be: waste of water (vital resource) and energy consumed by the pumping system, and shortages from the DWTP to users. This demonstrates the need to design a low-cost technological architecture for the automation of the water pumping and storage system applied to DWTP. As a result of the project, a prototype was developed with electronic components compatible with the IoT paradigm, and it was applied in the purification stage of the DWTP of the city of Catamayo. To evaluate the operation of the prototype of the automation system, data was obtained from the input / output variables, for 24 hours every 6 seconds. The variables simultaneously acquired in field tests were: minimum level status, maximum level status, pump activation status, and manual / automatic mode of operation. With the signals, it was possible to confirm the correct logic of the pump drive and the high efficiency of the communication system.
