ABSTRACT
In a study over the academic years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 data were collected which allowed studying the attitudes of students to the computer and the internet and the relationship between attitudes and that students use these tools claim to do. It was also applied a range of logical reasoning, which acted as moderating variable. This study was conducted to determine if the variable integration of Information and Communication Technology (computer use and Internet) in a systematic and regular classroom had any effect on the attitudes of secondary school students in the face of technology. Students participated in 75 randomly selected samples do not have that corresponded to only three classes in science and technology existing in the school where the study took place. From the methodological point of view it was decided to design a quantitative approach with quasi-experimental approach combined with a qualitative description and interpretation of the process. As data collection instruments were used two questionnaires: One of “Attitudes to the computer and the Internet” and the other “The use of computers and the Internet.” The questionnaires were administered by teachers of each class in Biology / Geology under the guidance of one of the authors. The results showed that sex had no significant influence, but age seems to affect the attitude toward the computer as well as regular use in the context of the classroom.
