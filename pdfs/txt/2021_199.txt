Analysis of the parameters of a solar tracker system, based on movements of a power generation system
ABSTRACT
Dual-axis mobile photovoltaic systems are the best option to make the most of solar energy, and it is necessary to use tools to make a detailed analysis of these systems, the objective of this study is the analysis of parameters of a solar system of two axes, based on the positions, on the voltage generation, and its relationship with the climatic conditions. Two systems are analyzed in Simulink, which allowed to study of the impact of the movements of a two-axis system and simulates how energy was generated in a solar panel, for which mathematical models were considered based on inductance, capacitance, and power. and solar radiation. In addition, a 2-axis mobile solar panel prototype was designed, with which real values were obtained about the resulting power and voltage in order to compare them with a power generation system to which average solar radiation and temperature were assigned. It is concluded that this type of panel allows to maximize the collection of solar energy, and these can be an alternative in mobile scenarios where the movement of the sun affects its performance.
