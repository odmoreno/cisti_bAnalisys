Enterprise Architecture Model oriented to Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry : Integration of Geospatial Concepts in a Specific Framework
ABSTRACT
A model is presented to integrate the geographical dimension - specific ontology - in the architecture descriptions of organizations dedicated to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, housing construction subsector. For this, the fundamental concepts and properties of a representative company are studied and the affected geographical elements that are considered in accordance with the strategic direction of the organization in the business layers, information systems and technology are determined. The discipline of integration of the geographical component required the evaluation of the needs of the organization's value chain using an adaptation of the Architecture Description Method (ADM), proposed by The Open Group, to generate a Specific Model of Geospatial Enterprise Architecture.
