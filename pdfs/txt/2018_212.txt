Business intelligence: Evaluation of occupational risks using a dashboard focused on decision making
ABSTRACT
Business Intelligence (BI) has been used for many business benefits because it shows trends, mainly sales, using dashboards: which products are sold more and which are less or how are the trends of consumers. On the other hand, the Occupational Health and Safety is critical for any company, because the absenteeism of employees due to an accident or work-related illness reduces productivity, and other unforeseen expenses. Therefore, there has been an opportunity to use BI in the area of health and safety at work. The purpose of this article is to propose a methodology to assess occupational risks by employee and show them on a dashboard so that employers can decide what measures they will take for the physical well-being of the people and the profitability of the company.
