Quantitative evaluation of Azores municipalities websites
ABSTRACT
In recent years, the number of sites and users has grown exponentially, and web applications became increasingly diverse and complex. The popularity of the Internet, however, does not necessarily imply the satisfaction of users. The quality of websites, especially the usability of the interface does not allow an easy and efficient access to information. This paper presents the evaluation of Azores municipalities' websites based on a method of quantitative assessment. This procedure allows not only an individual evaluation, but also a comparative assessment of the analyzed websites. In this case, the method was applied to already available websites. However it can be used in any stage of the development cycle, allowing a usercentered interface design, thereby ensuring the quality requirements of the interface.
