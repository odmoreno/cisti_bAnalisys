Intelligent decision support system for the efficient energy management in household environments
ABSTRACT
Knowing energy consumption habits can contribute to efficient decision making in household environments. This work presents a decision support system, based on intelligent energy storage, which is able to manage both the electric power and the smart home devices of a house in order to optimize the local energy consumption. The architecture of this system mainly consists of two units. Firstly, the Local Energy Management Units (LEMU), which are located inside the houses and are able to maintain the electric power consumption under a threshold value and to switch on/off the devices by using the X10 protocol. Secondly, the Central Energy Management and Intelligent System (CEMIS), that receives operation data from each LEMU, analyses them using behavioral algorithms and decides the best way in which each one has to operate, smoothing the load profile and optimizing the use of the resources.
