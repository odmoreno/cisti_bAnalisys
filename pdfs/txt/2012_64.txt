The e-learning applications on higher education: Its actual and future significance. Statistical validation
ABSTRACT
In this paper we analyze the evolution and the importance of the e-learning resources in the global higher education with a vision for the future. Its interest is due to the fact that these resources are switching from being mere support and complement for education to becoming directly involved in more advanced studies, including the participation of colleges of renowned prestige. The statistical methods are very important for the interpretation and validation of the e-learning resources. For this reason, in this work we deal also with the analysis of an important test: the hypothesis test, its validity and accurate application. We discuss the edition of a Wikipedia article by first year UPM (Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid) students in such a way.
