System for monitoring and control energy consumptions
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (loT) is a concept created to define the technological revolution of the devices used in day-to-day connected to the global Internet network. It is a technological revolution on the rise that is already present in various types of equipment. Thereby associating the need for monitoring of energy consumption to the paradigm of the Internet of Things, we intend to design and build an automatic system that allows monitoring and control of power outlets connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi called "iPlug". This system is a smart plug that fits a generic socket and provides information of power consumption (s) device (s) connected to it by calculating the current and the line voltage, this information is placed in a database. The iPlug also lets you know whether the outlet is on or off, change your status, and access to consumer data through two applications, a web portal and an application for iOS.
