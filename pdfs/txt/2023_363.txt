Virtual Reality for Sensory Therapies: A tool for children with attention deficit disorder and Down syndrome
ABSTRACT
The aim of this project is to develop a virtual reality tool for sensory therapies to make the experience more engaging and effective for children. Sensory therapies, which often involve prolonged periods of sitting and doing repetitive tasks, can become boring and result in decreased attention and motivation, hindering the child’s progress in therapy. To address this, the virtual reality tool, called “Sensory Space Work,” utilizes gaming and VR elements to hold the child’s interest and keep them motivated. The tool also features a database to track the child’s progress and activity, making it easier for therapists to monitor their progress. In a two-month testing phase in a hospital setting, the tool has produced positive results and is showing promise as a valuable tool for sensory therapies.
