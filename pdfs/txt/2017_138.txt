ABSTRACT
Patients in critical units require intensive care and constant monitoring, as their health condition is critical. Among the various care, the hydride control is fundamental, which is also known as control of gains and losses This care measures and records the total of fluids ingested and eliminated over a period of 24 hours. This article presents an application able to record and calculate the hydride control of patients in critical condition, hospitalized in intensive care units and/or semi-intensive. This application requires users with knowledge in the care area with patient (nurses, nursing technicians and medical) because it ensures the consistency of the information recorded and provide reliable data to an appropriate medical conduct. The application was developed to assist in the treatment of critical patients and to improve to working time of the users.
