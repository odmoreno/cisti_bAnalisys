Evaluation of the Augmented Reality Educational Application for the 2nd cycle of primary school
ABSTRACT
The use of augmented reality (AR) technology has been shown to be useful in several areas of human activity. In this sense, this study aims to understand whether these AR technologies can contribute to inform and educate children of the 2nd cycle of primary school about the outbreak by COVID-19. For this purpose, in addition to the systematic review of the literature of the last 5 years on AR, a case study was carried out with a group of experts who evaluated an AR application using Metaverse Studio. The study showed a very favorable response in relation to the use of these applications in the teaching-learning context, namely in basic education, confirming that it can improve the cognitive capacity of children, allowing them to retain knowledge and develop creative and autonomous learning after the experience of using this technology.
