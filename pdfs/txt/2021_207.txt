Framework for designing Business Continuity - Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Organizational Maturity
ABSTRACT
In a competitive business environment, strongly supported on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), organizations increasingly need to be prepared to cope with disruptions in their activity and business processes. Business Continuity Management (BCM) encompasses effective planning for the relaunch of business processes in the short term, through the implementation of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which constitutes a decisive management factor for the continuity of value creation or guarantee of delivery of goods or services, to safeguard the business survival. This work addresses this issue, supported by a preliminary literature review oriented to identify and relate the common basis of components and activities of the BCM in the normative references, models and libraries of good practices, in order to explore the identification of its gaps in driving an achievable instrument to all organization sizes, considering each component of the BCM, allowing to assess the stage of preparedness, implementation and appraisal of the essential elements, with greater focus on ICT systems, that guide the BCM and the design of a BCP tailored to an organization.
