Performance evaluation of a private cloud storage infrastructure service for document preservation
ABSTRACT
Cloud computing platforms provide easy and transparent access to a company's storage infrastructure through services. Commonly known as Storage as a Service (STaaS), it allows users to store their data at remote disks and access them anytime from any place. On the other hand, with the deployment of Electronic Document Management (EDM) to manage the insertion, sharing, and retrieval of information assigned to a digital document it is necessary that the processes of searching, indexing and storage of digital documents are carried out efficiently. Besides the use of computational tools focused on archiving digital documents, the storage solution must provide reliability and authenticity on the availability of digital documents. In this scenario, this paper addresses the deployment project of a content-addressable storage infrastructure in a large company and conducts performance evaluation to measure the gains in availability, r/w access and scalability of the proposed solution.
