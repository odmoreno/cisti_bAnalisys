Digital marketing of Sarumaky handicrafts
ABSTRACT
The main objective of this research was the development of a web system based on electronic commerce for the SARUMAKY company, which is dedicated to the production of handicrafts, among which are hand-embroidered garments. The development of this project was based on the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology, user stories were built as a requirements specification procedure. The interview technique (semi-structured) was used to collect the system requirements and was applied to the administrator of the Sarumaky association. According to the functionalities, the roles of administrator, cashier and customer were defined. The coding process was mostly oriented to the PHP programming language, the Laravel framework was used in its version 8 in complement with the Tailwind CSS and Livewire tools. To manage the code, the Visual Studio Code text editor was used and the MySQL database, the Apache Web server and the language interpreters were considered. The developed system, with scalable tools and architectures, is based on invoicing through banking entities and specialized delivery companies in the country, allowing the administration an alternative for the dissemination and commercialization of artisanal products, in addition to favoring the taking of decisions based on up-to-date and timely information.
