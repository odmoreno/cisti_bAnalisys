Human body modeling in geographic information systems
ABSTRACT
This paper falls within the scope of a project aimed at the development of a three-dimensional anatomical model of the human body based on geographic information systems (GIS). The specific objective of the present work was to develop a prototype that includes a topological 3D data model, an analytical function "point-in-polyhedron" and a set of functionalities to display the anatomical structures affected by an acupuncture needle inserted with a certain depth and direction. Tests made using random points in the geographical space of the model allowed the validation of the developed elements.
