Privacy in interoperability contexts — The area of health
ABSTRACT
Nowadays we are confronted with a progressive discrepancy between data produced and the use of those data as regulated by data protection legislation currently in force. User privacy and personal data privacy are now constant concerns of those responsible for information systems. In contexts of collaboration between systems, in an interoperability framework, challenges arise are different from those resulting from the presence of a user on the Internet in the field of data protection and privacy. Data privacy is thus the main focus of this paper, with particular emphasis on contexts of interoperability between systems. The goal is to provide an approach to the study of this issue by selecting the interoperability model that best suits this approach and use it to identify and study the main factors that affect data privacy. The Plataforma de Dados de Saúde - Portuguese Health Record (PDS-PHR) is the unit of analysis used to validate the proposed approach.
