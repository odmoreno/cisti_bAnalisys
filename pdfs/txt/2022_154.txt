IoT security issues in the context of Edge Computing: A Systematic Review of Literature
ABSTRACT
The large number of devices connected to the Internet have caused the traditional cloud computing model to become a bottleneck. In recent years, this has motivated the advancement of edge computing or fog computing, which provides analysis and processing capabilities closer to where the data is generated. Due to the large amount of information that will be exposed in Edge Computing, the need arises to study security in depth in the scenarios proposed by these new paradigms; For this reason, the present work shows the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in which, of the 50 studies analyzed, 24 security problems were identified, which are identified as attacks that mostly affect the user. IoT and are also the most frequent in Edge Computing, some of these are: DoS and DDoS attack, man-in-the-middle attack, phishing attack, replay attacks, collusion attack, physical manipulation attack, fake node injection and device cloning; In the same way, it was determined what: knowledge of the location, geographical distribution, decentralized architecture, mobility support, scalability and reduced energy consumption, are characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of security attacks.
