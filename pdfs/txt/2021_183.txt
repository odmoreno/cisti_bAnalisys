Monitoring the allocation of European funds in Madeira using dashboards
ABSTRACT
Portugal 2020 is a programme to support the country's strategy for implementing European funds between 2014-2020, with a total allocation of funds of 25 billion divided by 16 programmes to promote the competitiveness of the regional economy. The study presented here is based on the analysis of how the funds from the European Union are being applied in the Autonomous Region of Madeira (RAM). In this way, and so that the process of visualisation and subsequent analysis of the data is less time-consuming and complex, we resort to the development of dashboards to visualise the most relevant information in a single layout. Microsoft Power BI was used to develop the project, transform the data and build the dashboard. We built three dashboards, based on various interactions that allow us to analyse the allocation of funds by year, by category, by thematic objective, and by municipality. Once the dashboards are built, the information provided on them is an added value for decision making, especially in the RAM.
