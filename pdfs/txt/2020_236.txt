Characterization of Traffic in Mobile Devices: Web and Applicational
ABSTRACT
The data plans offered by mobile network operators to users are limited, with costs increasing proportionally to post-limit usage. Thus, users of mobile devices need to manage data plan consumption on a regular basis. In this paper, a comparative study of web and applicational platforms on mobile devices is performed in order to assess which one leads to low data consumption. The methodology used is based on the collection of traffic from each platform for comparison purposes. For this, an architecture was developed, and appropriate metrics were established. Considering Youtube as case study, the results show that the web platform uses less data for the average case, but that the recommendation based on the user profile, whether active or passive, will result in a consistently lower data usage.
