Governance of Information Technology (IT) aims to direct and control the current and future use of IT for the benefit of an organization, in order to guide the management of IT organizational resources globally through means and resources such as: access policy, risk management, human resource management, information access, transfer, storage and processing technologies and processes. This article examines guiding elements of the actions that allow the verification of the conformity of the organization, regarding its IT Governance. The importance of these elements lies in allowing organizational management to seek a competitive advantage, adding value to the business, by monitoring and evaluating the technologies and processes performance. Specifically, the guiding elements of the regulatory compliance verification actions (EVCRs) identified in this work were applied and validated in a Brazilian federal public company, allowing to improve its IT governance.
