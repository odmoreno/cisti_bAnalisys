Methodological design of user experience applied to, the field of accessibility
ABSTRACT
The field of web accessibility is currently based on the correct application of development techniques. This paradigm raises two problems: The lack of segmentation of user profiles, hardly the site will suit users regardless of their characteristics and the lack of involvement of potential users in developing accessible products. To study both problems we have conducted a study that applied a methodological approach combining the user-centered design with current standards. For our study, we developed a method for assessing web accessibility techniques focusing on user experience. This assessment has led to new indicators that reliably reflect the accessibility of the application. Finally we have done a guide that allows any research team without prior experience of web accessibility to make evaluations focused on user.
