Top ten NFR to survive in the “brave new world” of E-government applications
ABSTRACT
Outsourcing is a world-wide contemporary practice that has involved to software industry. Different States have incorporated this practice as a way of optimizing their resources. Therefore, software acquisitions require public calls for software tenders. Unfortunately, in Latin-American countries and, specially in their local governments, there are software projects formulated under conditions which seriously affect the success of these projects. In this paper we use the metaphor of the “brave new world” in order to close an empirical approach to the “real world”. We present a set of rules to be applied in e-government projects. These rules have been compiled from a set of expert “survivors” in the software market in a developing country. The goal is twofold, firstly, to propose a quick guide of non-functional requirements for e-government projects and, secondly, to show how using a literary metaphor allows to justify an epistemological position to empower the experience value of their original actors.
