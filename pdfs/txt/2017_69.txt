Position control of DC motor through space state for rotary platform
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design and implementation of a position controller for a rotary platform driven by a DC motor through state feedback. The main objective in this development is to make an electromechanical system and position control for a rotary platform using a 12 volts DC motor with quadrature encoder. The design and development stages were executed using computational tools such as Matlab and Labview. A DSPIC-30F4011 digital processor is used to implement the real-time controller. Is important to highlight the robustness of the space state controller developed even in the presence of adverse conditions such as non-linearity of electromechanical system. In this case the mechanical system of the rotary platform and the motor gearbox cause a dead zone in the response of the engine, which makes that the system presents a high nonlinearity and does not respond to over the minimum excitation voltages. Further it is interesting that the design process was based on the initial analysis of the problems presented by using a linear controller applied to a nonlinear system.
