Impacts of Artificial Intelligence on Public Administration: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
The advent of machines power-driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) have strongly influenced the world in the 21st century. The future of AI is promising and is offering a wide range of opportunities for scholars and academics. Although the theme has received a considerable attention over the last years, much has been speculated and little is known about its impacts on the Public Administration. Thus, the purpose of this article is to make the result of those impacts less ambiguous. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review to provide a comprehensive analysis on the latest impacts of AI on the Public Administration. Our intent is to narrow the field of study, while AI is being continuously strengthened with new empirical evidences.
