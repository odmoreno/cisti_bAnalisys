Real-Time Delphi questionnaire development at LimeSurvey: a Design Science Research approach
ABSTRACT
The use of the Delphi method is based due to its consistent establishment throughout the years in the research area. Currently, the maturity associated to the existent information systems and technologies are responsible for the evolution of the classic Delph method into a Real-Time Delphi method (RTD). It basically reduces to one the characteristic formal rounds associated to the classical method and shortens the time required. These new features lead to a growing interest and use of Real-Time Delphi questionnaires by researchers and professionals. Although this is a recurrent trend, it is not possible to identify the existence of a non-proprietary online survey creation solution with features to allow generating and applying Real-Time Delphi questionnaires. In this context and to respond to a research need it was necessary to develop a technological adaptation of the software LimeSurvey, an open-source online questionnaire management system to be able to create three RealTime Delphi questionnaires. These three questionnaires will allow the conception of a pairing model amidst food and beverage. To achieve the proposed objective, we used a literature review related to the Real-Time Delphi subject and the methodology of Design Science Research which will result an artifact, in this case an adaptation of LimeSurvey for the creation of Real-Time Delphi questionnaires. The results from this work are an adaptation and utilization of the open-source code from the LimeSurvey software and the creation of three RTD questionnaires for research purposes in the creation of a pairing model amidst food and wine.
