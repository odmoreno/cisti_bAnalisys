Systematic mapping of monitoring metrics in running computational systems
ABSTRACT
With the raise of computer systems' complexity, greater number of modules, technologies involved and functionalities, monitoring and keeping up with such systems in real time has become an indispensable task, given the fact that the quality of production software impacts directly on decision making and risk management by organizations. Knowing what to observe, which metrics are being more used for runtime software monitoring is an essential part of this context. Therefore, this article presents a systematic mapping regarding the monitoring mechanisms and raises a few research questions. Listing of most used approaches and metrics for runtime legacy systems monitoring. The survey of monitoring metrics allow a better approach for runtime legacy systems comprehension, allowing more suitable strategies for the continuity of such systems.
