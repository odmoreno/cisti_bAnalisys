Environmental building monitoring and control based on machine learning and fog computing on an IoT architecture
ABSTRACT
The urban population has increased in many parts of the world, concentrating mainly in large cities, inside buildings. Thus, it is important to optimize these buildings' environments, whether in terms of its users' comfort, or in terms of energy resources. This article presents a solution to adapt environmental comfort variables, such as temperature and illumination, according to the input parameters obtained from these environments by intelligent IoT devices. In addition to comfort for its users, it also seeks to increase the efficiency of the energy resources used. The work comprises the description of the architecture and the mathematical model used for this purpose, showing a practical application of environmental building control based on the number of users and their preferences, individually defined.
