Ecuador: the popular liturgical and festive origins of the Latin American indigenous post-drama and its specific conflict : Comparisons with the Spanish and European post-drama
ABSTRACT
Through the most important secular and religious festivities in Ecuador, this paper explores the popular origins of the indigenous (post-)drama in Latin America. This liturgical-folkloric beginning is somehow shared with that of Spain, of a medieval stamp (unlike the Greek one). It also explores the idea of Andean conflict or confrontation, of a (post-)dramatic nature, covering concepts such as vital tension, defiance, matriarchy and purifying rituals of a “magical” nature. To better understand these two issues, origin and conflict, we will make comparisons with the Spanish (post-)drama only for the purpose of better understanding the post-dramatic indigenism in Latin America.
