The impact of data accuracy on user-perceived business service's quality
ABSTRACT
As business processes have become increasingly automated, data quality becomes the limiting and penalizing factor in the business service's overall quality, and thus impacts customer satisfaction, whether it is an end-user, an institutional partner or a regulatory authority. The available research that is related to business services' quality paid very little attention to the impact of poor data quality on good services delivery and customer satisfaction, and to the calculation of the optimal level of data quality. The aim of this paper is to present a customer-oriented approach that will help to understand and analyze how an organization business service's overall quality is linked to the quality of upstream business processes and of data objects in use. This paper also introduces a calculation framework that allows the identification of an optimal level of data quality - data accuracy dimension in the case of this paper - taking into account the business processes' execution accuracy and data accuracy.
