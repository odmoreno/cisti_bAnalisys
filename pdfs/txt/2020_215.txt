A wearable device for monitoring health risks when children play outdoors
ABSTRACT
Health education is very important to raise awareness about the dangers of excessive exposure to the sun, and other climatic elements, especially for more sensitive groups of people such as children. Although there are many known benefits of sun exposure to human health, it is also true that, when in excess, it can also raise the risk of diseases related to exposure to these elements. It is, therefore, important to have monitoring mechanisms to keep children safe from health risks that may arise from exposure to those climatic elements. This work describes the development of a wearable device that monitors some parameters associated with health and conditions to which a child may be exposed and, depending on these conditions, it alerts to the risk to which the child is exposed. The strengths of the described system, regarding children's health, focus not only on the warnings that the changing colours of the light alert will provide them with, as to UV solar radiation, body temperature and ambient temperature, it also improves knowledge about the promotion of health and protection measures to be adopted, considering the conditions to which the child is exposed. For adults, the prototype also reveals some interest, according to the responses to the surveys, and advantageous in that it can help them in the constant monitoring of their children. But, above all, it makes it possible to raise awareness of the importance of health care, especially with children.
