Use of the Smartphone in Peruvian University Students to Learn Photography
ABSTRACT
This study analyzes how the smartphone would facilitate the learning process of photographic language in university students of the General Photography Workshop course in Lima, Peru. The study was positioned in the interpretive paradigm with an ethnographic design. The data collection technique was semi-structured interviews with six students. They mentioned the elements they learned in the photographic language such as point, line, rule of thirds, and direction. They were able to recognize the differences and similarities between a smartphone and a camera. Also, they shared their opinions on producing an image with a smartphone by applying elements such as light, exposure, and framing. In the future, it is recommended to incorporate the smartphone in photographic language learning sessions and take advantage of the tool in the teaching process in courses related to photography.
