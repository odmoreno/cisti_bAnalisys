SIEM Open Source Solutions: A Comparative Study
ABSTRACT
Computer attacks are increasing in complexity and number of occurrences making it imperative to implement tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to mitigate risks, as Organizations increasingly rely each time more on computer systems for the development of their activities. The presented work compares several SIEM “open source” solutions, resorting to bibliographic research and the implementation of several tests' scenarios, with the aim of creating a prototype and evaluating it in a production context. The chosen solution will have to take in account the legal requirements of the EU-GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, such as the anonymization and pseudo anonymization of sensitive data, retention time of “logs”, and its encryption and protection.
