Training System for Hybrid Vehicles Through Augmented Reality
ABSTRACT
This article presents the development of a training system in augmented reality; oriented to the teaching and learning process in the area of Automotive Mechanics for hybrid vehicles. The application developed will allow the user to be more immersed in the operation of the hybrid vehicle, therefore, it will simulate the movements made by its transmission which involves the power dividing device (PSD), MG1, MG2 and internal combustion engine (IC), in addition, it performs the virtualization of the assembly and disassembly of the device in order to optimize time and economic resources, among other benefits of educational and technological impact. The system is developed in Unity 3D's graphic environment by means of large-scale 3D object recognition; by means of previously established patterns which, once the application has been developed, will allow the user to visualize the transmission together with its main components and will serve as an aid for the methodological process of teaching and learning in Automotive Mechanics.
