ADS-B system exploitation: Analysis of the impact on the decision-making process of air traffic controllers through of the GRSO method
ABSTRACT
Among the most modern technologies used in air traffic surveillance systems, the ADS-B System is the one that stands out today. Such technology consists of a set of equipments and protocols designed to provide the means to determine the position of aircraft in flight from embedded navigation systems, as well as to periodically broadcast information of interest to other aircrafts en route and sensors on the ground within your range. However, serious security vulnerabilities lie at the heart of the ADS-B protocol, and the literature is unclear about the impact of exploitations in these breaches on the direct action of Air Traffic Controllers and aircraft pilots. This article aims to take an analytical look at the vulnerabilities present in the ADS-B system, not only when mapping attacks to that protocol, but also when seeking to identify, analyze, evaluate and classify the risks inherent to operational security through the GRSO method, focusing on the impact upon the Air Traffic Controllers decision- making process.
