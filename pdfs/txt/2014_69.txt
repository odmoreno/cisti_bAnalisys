A process to support the continuity of projects based on the evaluation of software components
ABSTRACT
In software development, many projects frustrate the the initial expectations in many time due to the unsatisfactory performance presented. Performance testing can assist in making decisions in advance about the continuity of the project, in order to not develop a low quality software. This paper aims to make a proposal for a process to support the development of software project, which seeks to use performance testing without the need for a prototype or active module of the software, using a set of reusable IT components in order to provide a technical basis for a decision about the continuation of the project. To evaluate the proposed process was carried out a case study in a software developer company.
