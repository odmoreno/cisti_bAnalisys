Agile Process Optimization: An Approach Using the CMMI and GQM
ABSTRACT
The CMMI model catalogs good practices in many process areas. It is therefore a very useful resource for improving software development processes. However, its complete and comprehensive nature can create difficulties, particularly when considering agile development environment, where lightweight development practices are preferred. In this work, we describe a methodology for optimizing agile processes based on CMMI, with reduced impact on pre-existing agility. This is achieved by defining improvement objectives with the GQM approach, that allow precise and intentional selection of CMMI practices with high impact towards the desired objectives. This methodology was validated in a medium size enterprise with good results.
