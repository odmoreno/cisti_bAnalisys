GLABS: Gamification for learning management systems
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the game mechanics-based learning management platform called GLABS (acronym created from "Gamified LABoratorieS"). Currently we can find different educational management systems, but are based on the management of qualifications, support, discussions, or work assignments. The application of game mechanics in some of them there, but is very limited, allowing the inclusion of a point system or awarding medals for achievements. The system described in this paper uses a standard educational management as Schoology tool to incorporate techniques of play called gamification, which allows to unify all the student tasks in a web/app. This form creates a more attractive and motivating system whereby you can create missions, view maps of missions, alert of points earned and even create portfolios of completed works. In conclusion, our proposal uses Schoology as a system of educational management plus gamification, which could be defined as a G-LMS (Learning Management System Gamified).
