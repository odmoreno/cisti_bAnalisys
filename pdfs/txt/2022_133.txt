Software development model in Small and Medium Enterprises: A still uncertain process
ABSTRACT
The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) objective was to search for evidence and investigate the state of the art of hybrid software development methodologies and answer the following research questions.RQ1: What hybrid software development methods have been reported in the literature in the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)?RQ2: What challenges are faced by software development SMEs in the adoption, execution, and governance of projects carried out with hybrid methodologies?RQ3. What are the best practices reported in the literature to successfully adopt hybrid methods in SMEs?To justify the SRL, the "Information and Software Technology" database was used, the search string was tested: Systematic Literature Review AND Hybrid Software Development AND Small and Medium Enterprise. The search yielded 43 articles, of which 6 analyzed study topics similar to those proposed for this research but did not focus on the particular context of SMEs.Taking into account the limitations of any SLR, the analysis carried out allows us to understand what has been the evolution of the methodologies in the last decade and extends the frontiers of understanding to conclude that hybrid methodologies constitute a field of software engineering, which can still mature to give more scientific support to this branch of knowledge.
