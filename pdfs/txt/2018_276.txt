Needs and expectations faced with the Moodle platform and institutional support available: The case of ISCAP
ABSTRACT
The fact that some researchers emphasized that there is an under-utilization of the potentialities of the Learning Management Systems (LMS) sharpened our interest in verifying what is happening in the institution in which we teach. The purpose of this article is to present and understand the way in which the teachers of the Higher Institute of Accounting and Administration of Porto (ISCAP) use the Moodle platform, in which contexts they use it, the relevance that the platform has, the reasons that lead teachers to use it, the perceived changes in the way they communicate with their students, the perception of their training needs and expectactions, and the way they perceive the support of the institution in which they teach at, as well as verifying if there is in fact an under-utilization of the platform and this serves only as a mere file repository.
