Drone with anti-larvaes biomedicines, using deep learning to identify the reproduction zones of insects
ABSTRACT
Arboviroses are classified as diseases transmitted by insects. Among these insects is the species Aedes aegypti, vector of several diseases like dengue and zika. It has a large incidence in tropical countries, having a significant number of cases in South America. Due to the annual epidemics of dengue, and aiming at promoting a more effective prevention measure, it was proposed the development of an unmanned aerial device, composed of a drone and a software with deep learning, capable of identifying foci and ejecting biomedicine capsules to eliminate the larvae of this insect, which proliferates mainly in foci of standing water. The deep learning software, using a backpropagation-type algorithm, is capable of identifying and classifying possible foci of Aedes aegypti, indicating to a controller the command to eject the biomedicine that eliminates the mosquito larvae, thus contributing to public health, by controlling the proliferation of such problem.
