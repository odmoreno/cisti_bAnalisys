Iintegration of numerical oceanographic modeling systems via web services
ABSTRACT
The main goal of this research is to study and design a system that uses Web Services paradigm in order to integrate oceanographic numerical modeling systems and autonomous computational systems. The system aims to provide an abstraction layer between applications such as Matlab, Fortran, Python, Java Script and the underlying network infrastructure. The system is based on the REST architecture and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) programming language. Thus, both internal modules and external systems can communicate in a distributed, low-coupling and transparent manner, regardless of their locale, development language and hardware platform. For Operational Oceanography, these characteristics bring some advantages, for instance, it provides greater processing power for the execution of numerical models using specific hardware and it is possible to integrate new numerical models. In this sense, the proposed system enables the evolution of the Numerical Oceanographic Prediction System specially core operations of the Almirante Paulo Moreira Institute of Sea Studies (Brazilian Navy), as well as other oceanographic researches in general.
