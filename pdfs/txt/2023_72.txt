Methodology and Infrastructure for Teaching Operating Systems Courses for Large Number of University Students
ABSTRACT
The article shares experience with teaching operating systems courses (of various complexity) for large number (up to one thousand) students. The nature of operating systems requires specific methods of lab environment/setup, lab exercises development and design of knowledge tests and final exam requirements. Automation of teaching processes is needed while maintaining quality of knowledge transfer and protecting reputation of the University. The article covers our experience with teaching courses covering UNIX/LINUX basics, administration of UNIX/LINUX operating systems, Operating Systems (classical course) and LINUX Kernel Programming. We discuss infrastructure that we designed, and we have been successfully using for several years.
