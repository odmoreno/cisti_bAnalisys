Validation of Liaw's attitude questionnaire: A study with Portuguese teachers
ABSTRACT
Liaw's attitude questionnaire towards computers and the World Wide Web (WWW), first published in 2002, has revealed good internal consistency but factorial problems over time. “Attitudes” can predict people's behavior in certain situations, although the relationship between attitude and behavior is complex and multidimensional. Having reliable and valid instruments to measure variables is an essential condition for the credibility of a research. Thus, we developed a study to determine the psychometric characteristics of this questionnaire applied to a sample of Portuguese teachers. Based on this study, other professionals may apply this instrument safely. It should be noted that the validation of a measure instrument for the social sciences is an ongoing process. In other words, validation is always needed when applying the instruments on new samples. The accumulation of data is crucial to determine the stability and credibility of the instrument, evaluating results and leading to its improvement.
