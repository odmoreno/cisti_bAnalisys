Faciem - Microservice-based application for face recognition in mobile devices
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, mobile devices offer a varied range of sensors that can be simultaneously used in diverse applications and contexts. Faciem is a platform conceived to explore these characteristics and to validate the presence of a distinct person in specified circumstances, according to the application data. The verification is performed by the mobile device, integrating GPS â€“ Global Positioning System localization and user face recognition. The system architecture is based on microservices to optimize the application and allow a lot of diversity of mobile devices, with diverse characteristics such as processor and memory capacity, to execute the application. The analysis of a use case, where students attendance is verified, shows promising results and validates the proposed implementation.
