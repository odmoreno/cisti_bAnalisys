The use of social networks as a journalistic tool by the Ecuadorian press
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to identify the use that the Ecuadorian press makes of social networks and if these represent a benefit as journalistic tools that generate greater immediacy in the information flow. For this purpose, the two national newspapers with the longest trajectory in the spatial context analyzed, El Comercio and El Tel√©grafo, were selected. In order to determine the behavior that the Ecuadorian press has adopted facing these new digital media, the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the two newspapers chosen for this research were analyzed. Additionally, interviews made to the main representatives of these journals and the results of a survey made to 389 people were studied. Based on the data obtained, it is evident that, despite the large benefits that social networks present, the media analyzed do not take full advantage of the resources that these tools offer to digital journalism. Interactivity with users, such as the undeniable utility of social media, is unequal in the two newspapers studied, with a higher participation rate in El Comercio. Finally, Ecuadorian newspapers still use social networks more as an information repository than as real-time content spreading tools.
