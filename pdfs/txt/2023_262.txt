Using Machine Learning to Analyze Requirements Quality: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
To conceive quality software, it is necessary that, before the development cycle, requirements do not have writing defects that may impact the final software product. Verifying defects in requirements is a challenging task if done manually. Machine learning algorithms are capable of generating their own decisions and results through pattern recognition and data learning. This article aimed to perform a Systematic Literature Review to search for proposals that use Machine Learning algorithms to identify defects in requirement writing. 703 articles were returned by inserting the search string in online databases, of which 11 final papers were selected. According to the results obtained, it was identified that the Random Forest, Bayes Net, and J48 algorithms obtained some of the best results in their models when classifying requirements. Most of the datasets were manually labeled by professionals, ambiguity was the most investigated defect among the selected articles, only one article used an approach to balance the data, and none of the works investigated defects in writing Use Cases and User Stories using Machine Learning.
