Developing a digital platform based on a design and marketing approach
ABSTRACT
The travel experience of customers has undergone many transformations with the advent of technology in the mobile APP market. In tourism, the use of digital applications (APP) improves the customer journey. The goal of this project is to build a digital platform based on design principles and a marketing approach to better respond to customersâ€™ needs and preferences. To accomplish this objective, a two-step multidimensional strategy was applied. Benchmarking was the first step, and visual identity variables. The second stage was composed of prototyping, and usability tests. Results suggest that it is possible to develop an intuitive and user-centered platform to respond to the tourism industry specificities. Further improvements will include new features and screens updates.
