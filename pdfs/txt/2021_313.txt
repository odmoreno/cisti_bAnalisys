Risk Communication in the Portals of Public Organizations in Latin America. Towards an Initial Evaluation
ABSTRACT
Risk communication arises from the need to investigate what type of information citizens require in emergencies and provide them with suitable tools for its prevention, action and control. In the technological age, the web portals of the official agencies in charge of disaster risk management constitute the gateway to the public, being one of the first sources of information when a natural hazard occurs. This research analyzes the management of digital communication of public organizations in the face of natural hazards. This main objective was carried out through the exhaustive review of documentation and the observation of web portals on risk management of 20 Latin American countries. The methodology used was based on the application of an assessment scale to 20 web portals of the organizations in charge of risk management in Latin America. The results obtained show the obligation to delve into the subject of training and prevention within the branch of risk management, and the mechanisms of immediate attention for citizens in the face of a natural threat.
