Engaging Students in Learning with Apps and Critical Games Analysis
ABSTRACT
In the course of Games and Learning we used a flipped learning approach, inviting undergraduates to check what they learned from the readings made at home, by solving a quiz online, at the beginning of the class. At the end of each session, they synthesize on a Google form what they have learned. In the second part of the semester, in groups, they had to analyze a video game and a serious game. In this second group work, they had to observe the players to play, and they had to describe their reactions. At the end of the semester, the students filled in an opinion questionnaire about the dynamics of the class and the work done. The reactions of the students were very positive to the approach used and to the fact that the works contributed to the development of the critical ability to analyze digital games.
