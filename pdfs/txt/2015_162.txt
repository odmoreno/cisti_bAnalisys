Building Information Modelling (BIM) taught in a Civil Engineer school
ABSTRACT
The management of the totality of information concerning different phases of a building can be supported on a common environment. This concept is the basis of the technology Building Information Modelling (BIM). The text describes how the BIM concept has been introduced in the Department of Civil Engineering. The school itself has been promoting dissemination of BIM based on short training courses, seminars and technical sessions, involving credible designer offices and involving students in research projects, PhD theses and MSc dissertations. The basic BIM technology must constitutes one of the essential tools in student's training, helping them, in the future, to facilitate their integration in a demanding and competitive work environment.
