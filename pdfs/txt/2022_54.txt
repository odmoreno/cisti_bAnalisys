User Interface Design for AI-Based Clinical Decision-Support System : Preliminary Study
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a case study about the initial phases of the interface design for an artificial intelligence-based decision-support system for clinical diagnosis. The study presents challenges and opportunities in implementing a human-centered design (HCD) approach during the early stages of the software development of a complex system. These methods are commonly adopted to ensure that the systems are designed based on users' needs. For this project, they are also used to investigate the users' potential trust issues and ensure the creation of a trustworthy platform. However, the project stage and heterogeneity of the teams can pose obstacles to their implementation. The results of the implementation of HCD methods have shown to be effective and informed the creation of low fidelity prototypes. The outcomes of this process can assist other designers, developers, and researchers in creating trustworthy AI solutions.
