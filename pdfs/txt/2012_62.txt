Extending Professional Active Life — Involvement of local government
ABSTRACT
Following the analysis of the European project EPAL — Extending Professional Active Life, we present measures that could be considered at a municipality level to combat social exclusion and loneliness of the population after his retirement, contributing to active aging, promoting and expanding the applications of e-government, and above all, promoting inclusion and developing the local economy. The so-called silver economy will remain active, continuing to teach and support the society.
