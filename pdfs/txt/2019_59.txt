Autonomous and Personalized Guide for Tourism Support
ABSTRACT
The number of mobile applications, available to support the user in his touristic activities, has increased significantly in recent years. Many of these applications present tour events based on the user's location and detailed information about these events. It is important that these applications can offer the user a personalized experience and events that are relevant to him, based on his location, profile, interests, experiences and available time. This work presents an application to support tourism, which allows the user to know about events and routes that include various events/activities, to know which users intend to participate in each event and to interact with other users with interest in the same events. In order to recommend the events to be shown to the user, the application takes into account the interests, user availability and history of the user's activities, which allows a more personalized and contextualized information.
