Business intelligence maturity assessment model for organizations
ABSTRACT
It's today generally accepted that Business Intelligence (BI) has a decisive role and offers competitive advantages in organizations, but the way it is used is different. The existence of BI systems is nowadays justified by the organizations necessity to adapt to a variety of business challenges. Today, there are a subset of business processes and critical activities in the model of each organization and its chain value, where the achievement of specific knowledge is crucial to support the decision processes. In order to be possible to make a balance between BI investment and its added value, it is very important to measure the maturity through an evaluation of technology, processes and the organization. MM's are considered an effective instrument to explore strengths and weaknesses and provide the current state of BI. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate BI solutions not only to help the organizations to percept implementation benefits also, but to provide a management and monitoring process. The feedback that this evaluation can bring will be a contribution to improve business strategy. As there is very little scientific knowledge of maturity models (MM's) and its methodology, the research point to demonstrate the importance of this issue, the need for BI evaluation and a new BI Maturity Model is proposed.
