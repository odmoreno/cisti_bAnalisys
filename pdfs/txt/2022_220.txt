A project that uses Scratch software to teach programming languages to fourth grade students (elementary school). Based on the defined indicators, on the characteristics of the beneficiaries and on the activities implemented, adequate measurement instruments were developed to verify the impacts on the target audience. Using secondary and primary sources, indicators were developed to measure the level of change that occurred in each project beneficiary, using quantitative tools. Regarding the software used, Scratch, it was possible to perceive that it enables greater group work skills, working on current social issues and/or technological profiles, fosters greater responsibility in the use of technologies, within the scope of digital citizenship, generates an increase in creativity and innovation, greater willingness to investigate and research different topics, greater communication and collaborative work.
