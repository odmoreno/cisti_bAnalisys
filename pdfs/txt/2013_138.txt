Social network websites in the democratization of relational marketing
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, creating and maintaining long-term relationships with clients is one of companies' main concerns. In this domain, the social networks' websites are potential channels and assume a growing and prevailing part in relationships between companies and customers. This research work assesses the level of the use of social networks websites on customers' relationship management. Within this scope, an empirical study based on quiz enquiry has been made to 184 companies in Aveiro's district. The focus centered on the following key questions: (1) level of use of the online communication tools, (2) type of management of the social networks' websites, and (3) perception of the contributions given to the relationship with customers. Results show that companies are aware of this new reality of social networks as a way of spreading and communicating, but, on the other hand, they do not see it as a tool to manage and boost client's relationship.
