Low-cost smart hydroponic systems for home environment applications
ABSTRACT
The use of hydroponic greenhouses is a very useful solution for growing fresh vegetables in places close to urban areas, reducing transport costs and waste due to their perishable nature. Hydroponics allows precise control over the production process in greenhouses, even eliminating the use of herbicides and pesticides. The use of hydroponic techniques in a domestic environment has additional advantages as it allows the consumer to choose the species to be cultivated, which is immediately available at the place of consumption. This paper presents a review of the literature related to the control process of hydroponic greenhouses, including the sensors and controllers used. Special attention is given to the application of low-cost PH and TDS sensors, seeking to find a cost-effective solution for a domestic hydroponic kit. The results are discussed, and innovative hydroponic implementations and new hardware solutions are proposed.
