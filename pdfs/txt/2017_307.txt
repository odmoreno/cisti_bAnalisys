Evaluation and measurement of the value provided by ERP systems: A case study with two Brazilian companies
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a case study with two Brazilian companies aiming at understanding the evaluation and measurement procedures of the value provided by the ERP systems implementation in order to justify the investments made. The results reported some benefits due to the system usage, mainly concerning changes on business processes and the management level. However, there was no formal evaluation or measurement process, as well as was not performed comparison between the situation before and post the implementation. It concludes that, case possibly there were a clear and well defined evaluation procedure, it would be easier to justify the investments made.
