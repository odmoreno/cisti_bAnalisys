Secure Academic Certificates Using Blockchainbased Technology
ABSTRACT
Technology is part of everyday life in any academic center. Manual tasks are replaced by automations that facilitate processing and save time and resources. However, the legitimacy of the data contained in digital documents is at risk due to the ease with which it can be adulterated. This paper proposes to automate the task of issuing customized digital academic certificates for educational institutions, without neglecting security. This process is supported by a mechanism that guarantees the immutability of the data through a prototype that uses Blockchain-based technology. To this end, tests were carried out to guarantee the unalterability characteristic of this technology and thus ensure that the information contained in the documents is not easily modified. The system also underwent a set of functional tests, which helped to determine that the system is in an optimal state to be used.
