A Gamified Mobile Augmented Reality System for the Teaching of Astronomical Concepts
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the first version of the PlanetarySystemGO project, an evolution of SolarSystemGO, a Mobile Augmented Reality game previously created with the Unity3D/Vuforia game engine. While both projects aim at providing awareness of several Astronomy concepts, for PlanetarySystemGO a web based back-end system was implemented, developed under the. NET technology, that allows the instructor to manage several aspects of the game. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that elevates the possibilities of current Mobile Applications by superposing digital content to real world objects. The mobile devices that run these applications are increasingly powerful regarding their computational resources, allowing widespread adoption of the AR paradigms. The system presented can be enjoyed by players of all ages, but our main target are school children and young adults, as an application tool or even for learning purposes. A set of field tests was conducted, validating the presented design, and allowing continuous improvement of the system.
