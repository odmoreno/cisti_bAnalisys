A proposal for visualization techniques recommendation to represent survey data
ABSTRACT
Survey is a scientific method used for analysis of various phenomena. The advancement of technology, which automates and simplifies data collection, significantly increases the number of possibilities for implementing such method. The Information Visualization (InfoVis) techniques can improve the analysis of such data by facilitating the results representation and interpretation. Given the wide variety of visualization techniques, it is necessary a study to assist in choosing the most appropriate technique to represent certain data. The aim of this paper is to present a set of rules designed to visualization techniques recommendation to represent the data coming from research carried out by applying the survey method. This set of rules was validated through an experiment with end users. The results showed that the set of rules promote the better choice of data representation techniques systematically according to well-defined criteria directly related to the context considered.
