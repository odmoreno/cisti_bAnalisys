Non-Functional Requirements In Health Information Systems:
ABSTRACT
In the development of information systems (IS) often non-functional requirements (NFR) are not considered as important as functional requirements. However, they remain essential to ensure software quality, as they are more critical than individual functional requirements. This research synthesizes the results of a systematic mapping research about NFR implemented in IS of the health area, where 488 primary studies were identified, of which 39 were included in data extraction. Among the most cited NFR, we highlight security and privacy, usability, reliability, and availability. The most commonly used requirement elicitation technique was the interview. It is hoped that the results will serve to assist in the quality of the development of software for the health area.
