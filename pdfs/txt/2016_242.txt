The problem of legislative traceability is a major problem for studies of the history of the law because it allows to go to the detail of contemporary articulated and know their origin in terms of changes in laws passed, whether previously introduced ideas in addition to the information context. This paper presents a conceptual framework for traceability of the law. Additionally a successful experience of implementing this conceptual framework is described, as in the case of portal History of Law belonging to the Library of Congress of Chile. Whereas the traceability of the law is a major problem for studies of the history of law it is fundamental to distinct terms and conceptual models to guide the process of implementation of traceability of the law.
