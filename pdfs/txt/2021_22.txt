On-line Measurement of Working Memory in Individuals with Aphasia using Electroencephalographic Signals
ABSTRACT
Recent advances in biosensing technology have allowed for a wider access to sophisticated data gathering tools, such as electroencephalography. These devices have the potential to be applied in several fields of study. In this paper, we investigate the application of a low-cost electroencephalography device in the context of the treatment of aphasia, a neurological condition that compromises the ability to communicate. Specifically, we aim to aid rehabilitation programs, allowing continual and online monitoring of the working memory capacity of aphasic patients. Evidence suggests that the main cause of difficulties in communication within aphasia lie in the deterioration of the ability to store and process data in the short term. We propose an analysis technique based on Event-Related Potentials and inferential statistics to provide a general score of working memory capacity. Preliminary results indicate that a low-cost, portable and wireless electroencephalography device is able to properly capture brain signals, which are then made available to a station that is responsible for analyzing and displaying the processed information to the rehabilitation professional.
