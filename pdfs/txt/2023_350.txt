IProgMe-MR: Mixed Reality for Visual Programming and Remote Controlling in Industry 4.0
ABSTRACT
Adaptation to Industry 4.0 involves the integration of the latest technologies into production processes with the benefits that this brings not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of safety. This makes digital transformation more and more accepted by companies and makes them convert their processes to be more efficient and competitive. IProgMe-MR is a tool whose main objective is to bring the control of a production line closer to the operator of an industrial plant through mixed reality. In this way, the operator is able to perform actions on the line in a more efficient way, without the need for unnecessary displacements and, therefore, reducing risks. The experience obtained after the use of IProgMe-MR in a real production line has been clearly satisfactory, which leads to consider that the use of this tool is practically essential for any operator in an industrial plant.
