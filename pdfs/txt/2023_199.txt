Creating online vídeo lessons in D-VET courses : A case study
ABSTRACT
The main objective of the D-VET project is to develop a methodology to help teachers to create online lessons in an efficient way. Other objective is to mobilize and incentivize Vocational Education and Training educators to take concrete actions for their upskilling and reskilling in the transition from paper to digital education and teaching. These objectives are in line with Vocational Education and Training priorities by contributing to innovation in vocational education and training and increasing its attractiveness. It was carried out a survey that intended to analyse the teachers’ perceptions regarding their competencies in online teaching. The main conclusions of this study are that teachers reported that they spend more time preparing online classes and they have poor specific training in distance learning and difficulties in applying e-learning in VET.
