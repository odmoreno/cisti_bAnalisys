Canonical data model to support Sao Tomean legislative process
ABSTRACT
This article proposes a canonical data model to support the Sao Tomean legislative process, which was developed with the aim of leveraging digital interoperability between the main institutions involved: Government; Parliament; President; and Constitutional Court. It is, therefore, a Government-To Government (G2G) type of e-government scenario. In the article, the model is described using class diagrams and state diagrams in Unified Modeling Language (UML). The previous analysis is described using use case diagrams and flow diagrams, also in UML. These constitute the products of the application to the select scenario of the first two phases of the Design Science Research methodology: identification and characterization of the problem; and proposal of an artifact to solve the problem.
