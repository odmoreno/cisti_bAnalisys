Software adaptation to local cultures: The positioning of the quatenus platform
ABSTRACT
This article is a case study, based on Participant Observation, which focuses on a digital platform which manages assets. This platform is for sale in different countries, including Portugal and Mozambique. As national cultures and institutions differ from country to country and as this is all the more the case when different continents are at stake, we herein discuss the adaptation of products and services to the cultures and institutions of each environment, for the optimization of sales and product positioning. The data of the case study comes mainly from the experience of one of the authors, who lived in Mozambique for close to two years, linked to the selling there of the digital platform. A review of the existing literature was also performed. The strategic notion of positioning is central to the success of organizations and should differ from context to context, where necessary. Namely, different economic and education conditions lead to distinct behaviours, which have a repercussion on the posture to be adopted for the selling of products.
