Study about the Utilization of RADAR During the Conduct of the Navigation
ABSTRACT
There have been technological advances in all areas, especially in maritime navigation systems. Design changes and the increase of automatisms, leads to transformations in the interaction between the operator and the decision support system, also reverting to changes in the cognitive processes, in the processes of information search and processing, such as situational awareness, anticipatory thinking. These changes can affect operators, both positively or negatively, and may have the opposite effect to the intended. They can cause an increase of the cognitive effort or until the undervaluation of events that are relevant to the safety of navigation. The present article presents preliminary results of a study that aims to analyse the work performed by the RADAR operator and the cognitive processes present during a period of great cognitive activity for all elements of the ship bridge. The data are being collected on Portuguese naval vessels sailing in high density areas of navigation and proximity to hazards, in the ports of Lisbon and Setubal. Records are made using Eye Trackers operated in the RADAR operator and by observing their work in a team, supported by audio and video recordings of all the activity on the ship's bridge. These data are complemented by two questionnaires for assessment of situational awareness and work effort (SART and NASA-TLX), totalizing the data of three questionnaires. The results suggest that the RADAR operator is subject to a high cognitive effort and that the interaction with the team is very important for this to maintain a good level of situational knowledge.
