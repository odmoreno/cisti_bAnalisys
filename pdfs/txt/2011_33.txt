Collaborative maintenance and construction of buildings supported on Virtual Reality technology
ABSTRACT
Virtual Reality (VR) models were created in order to help in the maintenance of exterior closures and interior finishes of walls and in the construction of buildings. The maintenance model allows the visual and interactive transmission of information related to the physical behavior of the elements. To this end, the basic knowledge of material most often used in walls, anomaly surveillance, techniques of rehabilitation, and inspection planning were studied. This information was included in a data base that supports the periodic inspection needed in a program of preventive maintenance. The results are obtained interactively and visualized in the virtual environment itself. A second prototype based on VR technology with application to construction planning, was implemented. This model intends to present the project in a three-dimensional (3D) way, connected to construction planning schedule, resulting in a valuable asset in monitoring the development of the construction activity, based on the construction planning designed. The 4D application considers the time factor showing the 3D geometry of the distinct steps of the construction activity, according to the plan establish to the construction. The VR technology is used, and presented as an innovative visual tool in supporting the fields of construction planning and of maintenance of buildings. It helps to establish a collaborative network between partners in a building.
