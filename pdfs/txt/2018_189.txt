Simulation of people counter for public service buses of Loja with IoT concept applying the Viola-Jones algorithm
ABSTRACT
Currently there is a boom in applications focused on the Internet of Things (IoT), especially in more developed countries. An example of this technological process is the intelligent classrooms, where software and hardware come together to establish wireless communications that allow remote control of various variables. Following this model, this article proposes a solution to improve the public transport service of the city of Loja through a person counter. This counter would work with an algorithm that has been used in a static environment similar to that of a bus with passengers. In addition, processes of said algorithm will be simulated with the MATLAB software in order to verify its accuracy.
