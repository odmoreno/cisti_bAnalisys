Academic Management Through the Visualization of Information
ABSTRACT
The analysis of data has become in recent years a mechanism to obtain relevant information for the strategic actions of any organization. In this research, an academic management system is developed using tableau software and visualization, in order to analyze the evolution of students within a transition plan between two engineering school careers that are being replaced. It is a descriptive study, with a mixed focus and based on the sustainability of the businesses through the management of information. The findings show that there are students who are lagging behind during the development of the plan and what are the subjects and critical levels. The proposed system allows us to glimpse underlying information that can be used to make decisions that ensure the exit of students as professionals of the selected career.
