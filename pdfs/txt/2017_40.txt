Facial recognition system for automatic presence control in a classroom
ABSTRACT
In this paper is introduced a facial recognition system, based on mathematical methods, developed to act as the presence of students identifier in a classroom. It uses a recognition process in which seeks to extract relevant information from an image, to encode and compare them with another images of faces stored in an image database. Such image information representing a set of characteristics showing the variations between images of the obtained faces and contained in the image database. The Facial Recognition System consists of two processing modules: a training phase and a test phase, applied to a group of students in order to verify the utility of this algorithms for people recognizing.
