MLV-Viewer: Data Mining Visualizations in Decision Support System
ABSTRACT
Information visualization is defined as interactive visual representations supported by the computer, in order to increase cognition. The tools and methods applied can help to accelerate the understanding of a large volume of data, improving understanding, especially with multidimensional data sets. Visual analysis methods allow decision makers to combine flexibility, creativity and human knowledge with the enormous storage and processing resources of today's computers to gain insight into complex problems. If we add data mining to advanced visual interfaces, decision makers will be able to interact directly with data analysis, adapting to their tastes and needs. The MLV-Viewer prototype, in its data mining aspect, will be described in this article.
