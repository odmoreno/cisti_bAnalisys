Intelligent mushroom harvest prediction system proposal
ABSTRACT
Organizations of the agro-industrial sector, are now increasingly investing in the development of technological systems that allow the computerization of all its processes. Recently the methods and techniques of computer vision have been widely used for monitoring and inspection during the production and harvesting, allowing detect problems early and thus, improve the quality of products. In the field of mushroom production one of the most important aspects, and perhaps most prevalent, is to be able to predict its production. To this end it is proposed an Intelligent System Mushroom Harvest Forecast (SIPCC), based on techniques and methods of computer vision and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This paper presents an architecture of a SIPCC functional and technical level, complemented with the analysis and presentation of data demonstrating its viability.
