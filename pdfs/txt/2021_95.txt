Eye Tracking Application in the Evaluation of Aphasic Portuguese Speakers
ABSTRACT
People with aphasia often have difficulty with sentence comprehension, especially sentences with non-canonical word order. Over the past two decades, interlinguistic studies have been using eye-tracking techniques to investigate language comprehension and production. Studies demonstrate the use of these techniques in populations with neurological or speech-language disorders, including aphasia. To investigate the use of eye-tracking techniques in Brazilian aphasic individuals, the authors are proposing a study to analyze sentence comprehension in the elderly with Brocaâ€™s aphasia. In this context, this article presents a literature review to define a methodology for conducting the study, and analyzes the use of eye tracking when evaluating cognitively healthy elderly by the Test for Reception of Grammar (TROG-2). The studies gathered in the literature review provided subsidies to define the screening process, select stimulus from TROG-2, and define metrics of interest using eye tracking.
