In-Vehicle Virtual Traffic Lights: A graphical user interface
ABSTRACT
Traffic control through an adequate location of devices can improve traffic flow and reduce collisions. Today's technology is capable of virtually conveying to the driver information that is traditionally displayed through traffic signs on the road. Relying on this technology we propose a novel approach to regulate traffic through the ubiquitous optimized management of individual intersections replacing the physical devices by Virtual Traffic Lights. We virtually prompt the driver with information related to traffic control and evaluate the user interface system with respect to safety and user acceptance to identify possible negative effects on the primary driving task. Results are promising since the driving performance using Virtual Traffic Lights did not significantly differ from the performance using conventional devices.
