Distributed Cybersecurity Strategy, applying the Intelligence Operations Theory
ABSTRACT
This document presents a line of doctoral research that proposes a cybersecurity strategy that has not been formally standardized up to date, based on knowledge of defense intelligence operations, and applying a combination of static and dynamic approaches, in a context of threat risk, anticipating its effectiveness. In this way, changing the current approach, leaving aside the old concept of "walled" defense, for a more innovative one, where information collectors or "spies" infiltrate "unknown terrain" or external networks to extract data and information, learn from context, analyze and detect patterns, be willing to share the knowledge, and then be able to make defensive deterrent, or offensive decisions in real-time.
