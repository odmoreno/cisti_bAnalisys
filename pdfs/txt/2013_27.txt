Assessment module automatic SQL code with feedback in the form of "tips" in the virtual learning environment LabSQL
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a module of automatic feedback that assists students in resolution of issues SQL, presenting "tips" on how to achieve the best response registered in LabSQL virtual learning environment. Through the environment, students can perform exercises, group activities and assessments at any time, anywhere and still receive a return automatically. The developed system receives as input the source SQL written by the student and evaluates the structure according to the groups of problems: syntax, number of columns, number of rows, content attributes, Order By, number of tables and concept. The "tip" is a recommendation tailored to each group specific problem, which will help the student in questions or errors. There is a great student interactivity with the environment, because it can refer n-fold program code to be evaluated, without overwhelming the teacher's work. The experiments performed during this project indicate significant results.
