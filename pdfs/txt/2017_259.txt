Radial inverse model to identify markets for assets exports: Inverse neural radial basis model
ABSTRACT
The opening of international markets is an opportunity for organizations to contrast with their competitors and, through international trade, to increase their level of competitiveness. However, before exporting, it is essential to know which international market to do so, in order to have a greater chance of success in terms of the results of the operation. The purpose of this article is to identify, in a technical, objective and automatic way, the countries with the greatest possibility of success in exporting assets from Colombia, through a process known as Market Intelligence (IM). To achieve this, an adaptive model based on the principles of computational intelligence and fuzzy logic is used. This together with the analysis of different models by supervised and unsupervised learning, will allow the identification and establishment of patterns in the historical exports of non - Miners most exported by Colombia in order to learn from them and be able to predict which would be the best countries to export a product of given characteristics. The model allowed relating the input variables that represent an export with the average annual growth of each export, which allows developing Market Intelligence.
