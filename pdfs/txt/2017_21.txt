Green IT maturity models: A systematic mapping study
ABSTRACT
The rise of Information Technology has impacted not only on the way of doing business and the digital transformation of organizations, but also on the sustainability, acquiring a special relevance through the idea of the Green IT. The Green IT is becoming an indispensable area in organizations and in a social demand. However, organizations do not have the necessary mechanisms to assess their maturity and improve in this area. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to carry out a systematic mapping study to compile the state of the art of the maturity models of sustainability, and, in particular, of Green IT, in order to establish a guide to develop a maturity model of Green IT. The results obtained demonstrate the novelty of the area and the lack of a solid Green IT maturity model and, therefore, the need to elaborate and validate a model of this type.
