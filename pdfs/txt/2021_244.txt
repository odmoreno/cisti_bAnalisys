Use of Structural Equation Models in Quality Analysis as a Decision Factor in SaaS Acquisition
ABSTRACT
Acquisition of Software as a Service is becoming increasingly common, even without the perception of the end user. In this model, the product ceased to be the main actor, and the service started to assume this role, with the internet being its means of access. In this scenario, SaaS-Qual is used as a way to establish instruments to mediate service quality. In this work, we present a model for measuring SaaS continuity intention by assessing the quality of service used by the user. Structural equations were used, and the proposed model is a refinement of the SaaS continuity intention model proposed by Benlian and information system quality assessed by DeLone & McLean's user satisfaction. The model was able to explain that the quality variables make up 45.4% of User Satisfaction, which added to the Perceived Utility explains 37.9% SaaS Intention of Continuity.
