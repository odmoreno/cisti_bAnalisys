ABSTRACT
Recently, the number of patients with diagnosis of chronic diseases has significantly increased in western societies. This growth implies an increase in both costs and resources for the health system as well as in the number of trips to health centers by this class of patients. Mobile communication technologies can be exploited to get reduced costs whereas chronic patients and their relatives can improve their quality of life. Otherwise, wireless communications can be affected by interference generated in patients' home environments. In this paper, we present a work which implies a change in the concept of health services and distance monitoring of patients with chronic diseases whilst helps to improve assistance quality as well.
