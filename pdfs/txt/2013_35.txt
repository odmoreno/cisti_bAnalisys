Collaborative competitive intelligence: A knowledge base system approach
ABSTRACT
This study develops a collaborative decision support system to enhance the enterprise competitive intelligence (CI) decision process. A CI knowledge model is constructed by identifying concepts of and relations among instance types, decision models, rules of thumb, and weighting of organization functions. The system consists of: 1) a Domain Ontology of concepts and instances to express the knowledge categorization structure; 2) a Task Ontology to express an objective-oriented knowledge framework to express the combination of questions; and 3) Semantic Rules to develop the logical steps for problem solving. The case experiment results of high Decision Correctness Rate and Departmental Weighting Correctness Rate show that this study has extended CI from information provision to collaborative participatory decision making support for action.
