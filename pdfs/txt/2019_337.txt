Tangible User Interface for Homework for Children with Communication Disorders
ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the need to offer children with Communication Disorders and their parents the possibility of doing, in their natural environment, homework that can be fun to develop. That homework should allow the Speech and Language Therapist to know if it was done or not, how much time was spent doing it and what where the answers to the different tasks, among other functionalities. That tool should be easy to customise and follow the general guidelines of telepractice. There should be a great care in designing the interaction in order to maximise the cognitive gains and avoid misconceptions regarding the age, dexterity or perception of the users. A brief analysis of a future prototype, is presented.
