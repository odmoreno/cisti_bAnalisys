Design of a System to Support Certification Management with an Adaptive Architecture
ABSTRACT
A flexible, scalable, and extensible architecture can provide operational continuity. However, traditional system development processes do not provide clear guidelines to meet these features. This paper designs a constantly changing certification management system for a university without an IT area. The methodology is inspired by design science through three phases: Identification of business needs, System development and validation. The system is designed using criteria for flexible infrastructure, layered architecture, and microservices. The architecture uses NoSQL database, Angular, and Docker. Thus, the entity adapts to new information and support requirements. The implemented architecture is validated with the user and shows an improvement in the flexibility attributes.
