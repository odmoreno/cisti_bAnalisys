A framework for organizational memory management of research projects in institutions of higher education
ABSTRACT
An institution of higher education that develops research projects can learn and remember the knowledge generated by these projects. In this paper we propose a framework for the management of organizational memory oriented research projects in higher education institutions. This framework supports the capture, storage and retrieval of knowledge from research projects, which could provide access to documents or documentation thereof. The construction of the framework is done using semantic technology that includes the development of an ontology and semantic retrieval engine.
