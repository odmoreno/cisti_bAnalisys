Cause Marketing in the scientific literature: a bibliometric and cluster review
ABSTRACT
Marketing related to a cause (CRM) or cause marketing (CM) is a strategy that seeks to consolidate corporate social responsibility, in such a way that socially responsible management becomes a competitive advantage, through brand positioning. The present work aims to identify the theories developed in relation to CM. For this, the literature review (RL) was carried out, especially the articles published in the main database of the Web of Science were analyzed. The RL allowed to conclude that CM has been studied in the last 20 years with different approaches, fundamentally it has sought to understand the relationship between this construct and other variables, such as: adjustment, consumer behavior, social responsibility, the brand, among other.
