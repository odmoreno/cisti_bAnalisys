Using feature selection algorithms in educational data: Three case studies
ABSTRACT
This paper discusses three case studies involving the use of feature subset selection algorithms, as well as feature ranking, based on real data on student performances in a course of a Bachelor of Computer Science program. The case studies aimed at investigating, as a step prior to the use of data mining algorithms for performance prediction, the effectiveness of feature selection methods, for reducing data volume.
