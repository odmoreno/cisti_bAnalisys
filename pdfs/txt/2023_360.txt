Nudge applied to tobacco consumption : Effect on smokers and non-smokers
ABSTRACT
This article aims to clarify the concept of nudge, a decision support system (knowledge-driven), and understand what relationships exist between the following variables: being a tobacco user or not, gender, the incentive to smoke or not, and the awareness that images contained on tobacco packages provoke in people. We conducted two searches in academic databases, with a total of 29 articles analyzed. Additionally, we used a structured online survey with 21 questions, and then performed a descriptive and inferential analysis of the data collected, with a predominance of nominal and ordinal variables. The questionnaire was available for a 2-week period. The results obtained show that there is only a statistically significant association between tobacco consumption and gender, with no other statistically significant association between the variables analyzed. Finally, we leave some recommendations of what could be studied in the future, namely, what strategies could be implemented in conjunction with the nudge to make it effective.
