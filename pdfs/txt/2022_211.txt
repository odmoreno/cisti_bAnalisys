Evaluation Model for Digital Educational Resources (RED) focused on the population with hearing disabilities in Colombia
ABSTRACT
Digital Educational Resources are widely accepted by students and strengthen teaching-learning processes. However, the study carried out exploited the fact that Digital Educational Resources are largely not accessible to the population with some type of hearing or visual disability. The Colombian Government defines a regulatory framework to guarantee educational inclusion including people with disabilities, for this reason the Colombian State and the Higher Education Institutions must commit and appropriate resources for the materialization of the inclusive education policy. This article presents an evaluation model for accessible digital educational resources based on 4 factors (Content, Pedagogical, Accessibility and Usability), 7 criteria and 80 characteristics, which arise from the analysis of academic and regulatory references with the participation of academic and business experts.
