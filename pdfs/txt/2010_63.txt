Easing the use of network knowledge: Aiding in class registration with timetable selector
ABSTRACT
Timetable Selector is an application built to ease the selection of a timetable in FEUP's information system. A server uses HTTP to navigate through the information system's web pages, artificial intelligence to select the appropriate hyperlinks and relies on regular expressions to interpret HTML and collect relevant knowledge. Further functionality allows the user to find adequate combinations from within all the possibilities - besides allowing for manual combinations of timetables, this service heuristically tests the combinations in real time and presents the students with adequate solutions for their timetable generation. Data is presented to the users as a Web application. Performance considerations are studied and discussed.
