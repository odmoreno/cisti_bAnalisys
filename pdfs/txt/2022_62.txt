Circular Economy and New Technologies in Latin America as a Contribution to Sustainable Development
ABSTRACT
Currently, the planet faces a scenario in which the overexploitation of finite resources has seriously compromised their availability for the development of activities subject to their use in the long term. According to the perspective of several authors, through the circular economy it will be possible to preserve the value of materials and products for as long as possible, avoiding sending as much waste as possible back to nature and getting it to be reintegrated. to the production system for reuse [11]. The objective of this research was to analyze the activities related to the circular economy in Latin America, through the use of panel data econometric techniques. The results showed that the best model that fits is the one with fixed effects and that the main problems that affect the environment have to do with the growing demand for natural resources and with the planet's capacity to assimilate the waste it generates. Therefore, it is essential to forge productive cooperative relationships and transformative alliances within the region and encourage governments to play a fundamental role as sources of financing for new initiatives in infrastructure, education and R&D, which are important to promote the transition towards the circular economy and link it with the development of Industry 4.0 technologies.
