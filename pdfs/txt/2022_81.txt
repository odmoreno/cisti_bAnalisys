Low-cost CPAP device for patients with COVID-19
ABSTRACT
The increase in COVID-19 infections due to the appearance of new variants causes serious health problems in the population. Although the majority of those infected have no symptoms, approximately 19% will require oxygen therapy for respiratory support, either by invasive or non-invasive ventilation. The high costs of this equipment mean that hospitals in developing countries have a limited supply of such equipment. Therefore, this paper presents the redesign, simulation, fabrication, and evaluation of a CPAP device that was developed in Europe but has now been replicated in Latin America. It starts with the analysis of the deviceâ€™s original design and through exploratory techniques and computer simulation the materials, parts, and assembly are determined. Functional tests validate that a prototype similar to the original was obtained that will provide noninvasive positive air pressure that keeps patients' airways open.
