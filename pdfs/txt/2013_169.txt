Moodle acceptance according to its mandatory use
ABSTRACT
The main goal of this research project is to verify on which terms the acceptance of learning management system (LMS), called Moodle, can be evaluated by using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) considering the intention of use a unchanged variable at the same time reflects the students evaluation by students enrolled in the first year, in the course of Informatics by the School of Business and Administration of Polytechnic Institute of Set√∫bal. Were used as external variables of the model (TAM 3): job relevance, result demonstrability; perceptions of external control and computer anxiety and data were collected using a survey to a sample of 211 students. There was an absence of relationship between computer anxiety and Perceived Ease of Use, and between Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness. It was found that the Result Demonstrability of using Moodle reveals a direct influence on the use of Moodle, contradicting the theoretical assumptions of TAM 3. With the presuppositions listed it is possible to evaluate the acceptance of Moodle.
