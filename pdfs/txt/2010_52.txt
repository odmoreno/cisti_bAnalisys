Thematic repository as alternative model for science communication
ABSTRACT
The institutional and thematic repositories seen as alternative models of scientific communication can provide significant contributions to accelerate the scientific processes. It's presented in this article an academic experiment with the implementation of a thematic repository used to store digital content from academic research undertaken in the laboratory. Using a system of repositories of content developed in the Java programming language as a base for storage. The implementation of academic experiment is in accordance with JCR 1.0 as described by JSR-170 specification that defines a standard programmatic interface for communication systems with content repositories. It's also submitted an application with web interface that implements features that enable communication and manipulation of thematic content in the repository. Presents as result the prospect that thematic repositories when used in research laboratories can enable digital content from scientific research to become feasible for being reused as new research grants in the same area of academic context.
