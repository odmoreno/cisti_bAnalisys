Development of GDPR-Compliant Software : Document Management System for HR Department
ABSTRACT
Enterprise information systems store and process personal data. The enactment of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has imposed new requirements on the development of software systems that process personal data. In the scope of this project, it was studied the impact of GDPR in the human resources department and developed a software solution to manage job applications, from the gathering and analysis of requirements to the implementation and testing of the software. The development of a software system for data processing in a human resources department allowed to evaluate the impact of the GDPR on enterprise information systems and to draw lessons for the development of personal data processing software under the GDPR compliance, with particular emphasis on procedures for obtaining consent, data security and the enforcement of usersâ€™ right.
