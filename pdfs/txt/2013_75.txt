Building clusters for CRM startegies by mining airlines customer data
ABSTRACT
As airlines strive to gain market share and sustain profitability in today's economically challenging environment, they should develop new ways to optimize their frequent flyer programs while increase revenues. Aware of the challenges, airlines want to implement a customer relationship management (CRM) strategy based on customer analytics and data mining techniques to support marketing decisions. So, to achieve this goal, we have to apply clustering techniques to the company customer databases and develop a single view of customer across their demographic and behavioral characteristics as well as their value for the company. This will enable the company to identify the most profitable customers and run marketing campaigns more efficiently.
