ABSTRACT
The spatial databases produced, published and shared within the scope of the exponential increase of users and applications of spatial data promotes data quality assessment and management procedures and tools. The development of geographic information systems and spatial data infrastructures reveals the growing attention and challenges of spatial data quality assessment concepts and practices development. This work aims at the development of an indicator based quality assessment focused in the implementation and operation of a spatial data infrastructure for water resources management. We also present proposals regarding the data life cycle quality assessment issues, implement procedures and ISO 19100 series standards, technological advances, individual and institutional capacity building as well as, institutional information systems governance development.
