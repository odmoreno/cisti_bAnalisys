Integration of university information systems using Web Services
ABSTRACT
The growth and development of an Institution, such as an University, in the number of people and the size of its physical space, can lead to a weak system of communication and connectivity. These factors can compromise the integrity and performance of the technological services. In fact, they have consequences in the flow of the administrative processes with financial and pedagogic consequences for the Institution. Here, we present the development of a prototype for an integration solution of several university information systems based on a Web Services approach. We established the University of Azores (UAc) as our case study, which can be interesting because of the heterogeneous and decentralized nature of the institution organization. Following this technological approach, we intend to show the fitness of the development of software systems based on service-oriented architectures to our case study. We believe that implementing a Web Services solution, allows agility and security, increases speed and ability, can be an economic form of service delivery in the exchange of (critical) information among UAc internal entities (e.g. Academic and Social Services) and external bodies (e.g. local airline company, Social Security Government Services).
