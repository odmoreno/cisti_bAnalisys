Possibility of building a fuzzy epistemology from fuzzy logic presuppositions
ABSTRACT
Fuzzy logic is one of the so-called polyvalent logics whose main characteristic is that it considers that the difference between concepts is not of essence but of degree. The objective is to propose the possibility of building a fuzzy epistemology and ontology from fuzzy logic assumptions. To do this, first, the structural elements of fuzzy logic will be identified. Then fuzzy ontology and epistemology will be defined. The relationships between logic, ontology and epistemology will be described and, finally, it will be concluded by presenting the assumptions on which a fuzzy ontology can be built considering that reality itself is fuzzy, as the difference between the different entities that they compose it is not of essence but of degree and that this fuzzy ontology implies in turn a fuzzy epistemology.
