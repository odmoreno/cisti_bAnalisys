Machine learning in incident categorization automation
ABSTRACT
IT incident management process requires a correct categorization to attribute incident tickets to the right resolution group and obtain an operational system as quickly as possible, having the lowest possible impact on the business and costumers. In this work, we introduce a module to automatically categorize incident tickets, turning the responsible teams for incident management more productive. This module can be integrated as an extension into an incident ticket system (ITS), which contributes to reduce the time wasted on incident ticket route and reduce the amount of errors on incident categorization. To automate the classification, we use a support vector machine (SVM), obtaining an accuracy of 89%, approximately, on a dataset of real-world incident tickets.
