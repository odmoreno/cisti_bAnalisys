Parallel remote servers for scientific computing over the Web: Random polygons inscribed in a circle
ABSTRACT
Computing over the Web can be applied to solve problems of many types of users, namely companies, which can thus benefit from remote services, e.g., from academia, without the user's awareness. An illustration of scientific computing over the Web is described, based on remote servers in parallel, as fits separable time consuming tasks. The illustrative problem chosen was the probabilistic behaviour of the perimeter of random polygons inscribed in a circle, as: it is simple to state; its Monte Carlo resolution suits the computing considered; and each polygon to be simulated (with 3, 4, etc., sides) can be assigned to each server, here two servers. Our objectives are: to signal the adequacy of the Web for scientific computing; and to show the use of parallel, possibly heterogeneous remote servers. The problem can be freely solved on the authors' webpage. We think the benefits of scientific computing over the Web, despite the ubiquity of this environment, have lagged behind most other uses.
