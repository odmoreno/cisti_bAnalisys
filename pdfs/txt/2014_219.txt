Co-creation of a serious game to develop competences on the primary education program
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the research work carried out by an interdisciplinary group of technologists and entertainment experts in collaboration with primary teachers to develop a serious game to work primary education-oriented competences. The serious game called “Ferran Alsina” is conceived as a tool to develop competences in the primary education program. To design this game, 25 primary school teachers helped the technical and investigative team in a co-creation activity executed with the methodology named Action-Research. This allowed the implementation of competences inside the game's playability and narrative.
