The new era of the smart cities Open Innovation based on human-centered computing methodologies applied in the PEOPLE project
ABSTRACT
The evolution of cities based on the technology progress is providing a huge potential to enhance activities, services and economic development towards a better life quality. But cities have to deal with managing the growing diversity of data, applications and devices needed to develop services, and to tailor these services to each citizen's requirements. The establishment of human-centered computing methodologies for developing services leads cities towards the Open Innovation, meant as the key to develop innovative ecosystems characterized by real-life experiments that result in new services. PEOPLE project represents a step towards this evolution by putting in practice the concept of human-centred computing in real scenarios (Livings Labs), where citizens participate continuously and actively in the creation and validation of new tailored services. The outcomes of implementing the methodology proposed by PEOPLE develop, implement and deploy innovative services based on ICT infrastructures with guidelines set by citizens, covering users' real needs sustained by collaborative basis.
