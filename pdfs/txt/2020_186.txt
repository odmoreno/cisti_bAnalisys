Esquema de certificación por conformidad de requisitos del estándar ISO/IEC 29110 para la calidad de las empresas software
ABSTRACT
Small software development companies require for their process management of their software processes proposals specific to their context, in order to they can improve in their daily work. This article presents a certification model for compliance requirements based on the ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 standard (analogously to that made for the ISO 9001 or ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO/IEC 20001 certifications) for supporting to small software development organizations interested in ensuring the software product quality through processes improvement and certification. A pilot project has been carried out to determine the suitability of the model proposed put in practice, which had as scope the defined processes by the company that were related to project management and software implementation. On these two processes, this company has satisfied the requirements established by the model for obtaining the certification in ISO/IEC 29110. From this application it can be evidenced that the proposed model is economical for the implementation of the standard and for its certification audit, given that: (i) it is limited only to two processes that all companies carry out when they develop software, (ii) the reference model establishes the “must be” (requirements) of the two proposed processes, which are those that must be satisfied, and (iii) the certification by conformity of process requirements is less complex, and therefore less expensive, than other certification schemes (such as, for example, process assessment schemes).
