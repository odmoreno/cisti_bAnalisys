National Cybersecurity Strategy for Developing Countries : Case study: Ecuador proposal
ABSTRACT
The use of Information and Communication Technologies maintains inherent risks that affect the processes they support, many with state responsibility and that must be systematically managed through a National Cybersecurity Strategy (ENC). However, in some developing countries this has not yet happened, due to circumstances in the region and due to political, economic or social considerations that in some way have impeded their development or have developed in an incipient manner with the collaboration of concerned international organizations. Models and examples of National Strategies have been published, but in some cases oriented to developed countries or cultures different from that of the region. Good practice manuals have also been prepared by international organizations that work on these issues, based on lessons learned in similar exercises carried out in some cases with foreign consultants far from the local reality. This work presents a proposal based on good practices and knowledge of the local reality previously defined through research carried out on the components of a National Strategy. The proposal aims to guide those interested in the product to obtain after a participatory methodological process of executing a life cycle explained in previous works published by these authors.
