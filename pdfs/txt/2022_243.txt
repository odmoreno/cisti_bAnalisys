Framework for the design of accessible software to support users with autism : A proposal oriented from the HCI
ABSTRACT
This document presents the current advances of the third year of research in the Doctorate in Electronic Sciences at the University of Cauca (COL), co-directed by professionals from the Francisco de Vitoria University (ESP) and the Portucalense University (POR), who, starting from the analysis about the lack of accessible software that supports therapies, based on the management around behavior and communication of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder -ASD, look for a proposal for a framework for the design of accessible applications that allow the development of software based on accessibility and focus on autism, and also improve social interaction through the use of the applications developed.The study is based on the use of software focused on strengthening social and motivational skills, also on the characteristics of the treatment processes of children with ASD. The procedure is validated through metrics and qualitative and quantitative analysis with evaluation indicators on the appropriation or strengthening of emotional skills in children with ASD and the definition of the characteristics of the software developed with co-design techniques that involve the children themselves. The tools considered are non-invasive instruments to collect information, film activities and analyze emotions through the recognition of their facial expressions. Of the main advances achieved, the results of the systematic review of the literature and a case study are presented, where the identification of the most relevant functional and non-functional characteristics of the software applied in the treatment of ASD is obtained, as well as the proposal framework for the design of accessible computer applications focused on users with this cognitive disability.
