Strategic analysis of urban water and wastewater systems expansion
ABSTRACT
The continuing and exponential growth of the urban population in recent years has had a huge expression, especially in developing countries but also in others more advanced. Studies show that this process is far from slowing down, it's beginning to emerge concerns regarding the territory over the occupation and the consequent imbalance of urban spaces. However, it is believed that if there is proper monitoring of its expansion, including its infrastructures, growth can be achieved in a balanced and sustainable way. The completion of this expansion is dependent on a decision process that needs to be clear, reasoned and defensible. The Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) are tools that help the stance with these characteristics. It is presented a SDSS prototype for the strategic analysis of the expansion of the urban networks of sanitation and water supply systems.
