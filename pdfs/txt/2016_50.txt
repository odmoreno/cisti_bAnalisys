Development of a teaching tool using robotic concepts and programming
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the project of a robotics teaching tool which was designed to be a playful tool for learning check. The relevance of this study is due to the fact the design of this tool have originated from an extracurricular vision of a group of students who contributed to the development of it and had robotics as a form of entertainment that belongs to their world outside of the classroom. We ran up a tool usage session in a general education class with several students in order to test their entertaining features and determine the learning fixing ability of non-technical disciplines by the students who were involved in developing the same.
