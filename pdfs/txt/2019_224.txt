Use of genetic algorithms to solve problems in the Academic field Problem Solving Methods
ABSTRACT
The educational context is a scenario that presents a number of drawbacks linked to the lack of automation of processes, or the search for solutions that meet a specific need. The common and recurrent factor of all these disadvantages at an academic level, are related to the strategic planning of processes, tasks, designation of human resources in certain areas, given a set of restrictions and requirements. Currently, one of the most commonly used problem-solving mechanisms are genetic algorithms, due to the wide range of problems that can be covered, considering the degree of study, and the number of times that have already been addressed. From there, genetic algorithms are presented as the most accurate method to face and solve these problems. The adaptive nature of this method makes it the main input for the search for solutions in the entire field of education.
