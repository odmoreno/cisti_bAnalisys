Acceptance Tests over Microservices Architecture using Behaviour-Driven Development
ABSTRACT
The application of software quality assurance practices upon microservices architectures can be somehow challenging, mainly caused by the high granularity with low coupling of its software components. Since this granularity is not visible to the end user, it is difficult to assess the whole system behaviour. This paper proposes the use of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) technique on software development based on microservices architecture, by building test scenarios written by non-technical users and developing automated tests on API REST services layer, enabling the ability to match system results to end-user needs. Using a real scenario of a pay roll system, the applicability of the Behave BDD tool was assessed for acceptance tests automation.
