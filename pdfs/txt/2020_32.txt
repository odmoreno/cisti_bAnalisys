Evaluation of apps used in an educational context
ABSTRACT
Lately we have seen a continuous increase in the use of technologies in teaching and learning processes and more specifically in the use of mobile technologies inside and outside the classroom. Rather than indifference or refusal, this tendency is a harnessing of latent potential and an effort to adapt school to the importance of technology in society. New ways of teaching and learning using the smartphone allow the design of activities that apply apps as a didactic tool for use in the classroom. The aim of this research is to find a set of indicators that permit teachers to evaluate apps from a repository they have used, are using or intend to use in educational context and want to share with the community to facilitate their proper adoption. The problem of the possible impacts of the use of the smartphone on memory, attention or other cognitive dimensions is out of the scope of this work: we focused essentially on its potential as a means to explicit knowledge and increase motivation and collaboration. So, we propose an analysis organized into three categories and 23 attributes.
