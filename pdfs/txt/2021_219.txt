UNAME Tool: Automatic Generation of Computer Resources Monitoring Scripts
ABSTRACT
Decision-making regarding performance issues requires computer systems monitoring at any level of service provisioning. However, most of the available tools do not always allow flexibility, or when it does, it impacts directly the resource consumption through an intrusive methodology. This paper presents the UNAME tool, which proposes the automatic generation of Shell scripts for monitoring computational resources. Through a GUI, the user can drag in or out the components to be evaluated. The Linux monitoring commands were mapped to high-level representations of the computational resources, and now the user, through little interaction or knowledge about scripting, can generate their own scripts to monitor the required system resources. To demonstrate the UNAME tool feasibility we provide a case study and an evaluation scenario. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool.
