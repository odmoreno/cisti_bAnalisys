NetLogo implementation of an evacuation scenario
ABSTRACT
The problem of evacuating crowded closed spaces, such as discotheques, public exhibition pavilions or concert houses, has become increasingly important and gained attention both from practitioners and from public authorities. A simulation implementation using NetLogo, an agent-based simulation framework that permits the quickly creation of prototypes, is presented. Our aim is to prove that this model developed using NetLogo, albeit simple can be expanded and adapted for fire safety experts test various scenarios and validate the outcome of their design. Some preliminary experiments are carried out, whose results are presented, validated and discussed so as to illustrate their efficiency. Finally, we draw some conclusions and point out ways in which this work can be further extended.
