Library in django framework to standardize early-stage web application development
ABSTRACT
The development of web applications with Django does not normally follow a unique structure, however, the start of a new project has certain steps that are somewhat repetitive, which causes the developer to lose this time in general configurations This work proposes the development of a standard template, with enough elements to start the development of Web applications with Django, allowing the developer to focus on the main problem, which is the complexity and functionality of his business and system. The initial results show that the generation of an application, using the proposed library, can mean to the developer an approximate time of between 90 seconds and 105 seconds (about 2 minutes). Allowing a considerable saving of time, which usually takes the configuration and structuring of a Django application.
