Prototype of smart community alarm for monitoring events and incidents related to citizen safety
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, citizen security events and incidents constitute an imperative problem for inhabitants and the government of any territory. Different scenarios can increase risk level and physical and psychological damage on people's integrity. In that sense, the use of technology allows to integrate different services that provide a practical and reliable solution for different risk scenarios. This work presents the design of a prototype for a smart community alarm that sends an alert in emergency cases through the use of a mobile application, an Arduino board and a GSM-GPRS module. The main contribution of this prototype is to ease the communication of events and security incidents between citizens and the relief institution. For prototype functionality evaluation, four test scenarios were designed, those scenarios represent the incidents with more frequency in the community. Further results are: response time evaluation, sound type and decibel level that must be generated according to incident type.
