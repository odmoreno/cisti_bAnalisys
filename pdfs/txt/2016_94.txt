Analysis of Land and marine resources by processing high resolution satellite images
ABSTRACT
In the last decades, there have been a decline in ecosystems natural resources. The objective of the thesis is to develop advanced image processing techniques applied to high resolution remote sensing imagery for the ecosystem conservation. Different pre-processing steps have been applied in order to acquire high quality imagery. The thesis is focused in three ecosystems from Canary Islands where, after an extensive analysis and evaluation, Weighted Wavelet `Ã  trous' through Fractal Dimension Maps and Fast Intensity Hue Saturation are used in the pansharpening process, then, a RPC model performs the orthorectification and finally, the atmospheric correction is carried out by the 6S algorithm. The final step is to generate marine and terrestrial thematic products using advanced classification techniques for the management of natural resources.
