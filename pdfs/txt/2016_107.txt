New forms of interaction in serious games for cognitive rehabilitation: Implementation and usability study
ABSTRACT
Serious Games are an important tool in health rehabilitation, contributing to increase the motivation of patients in the completion of tasks included in their recovery programs. Following the study of the set of features which can be used to improve cognitive therapy processes, making them more motivating for the patients, we develop a web platform composed of a set of games that seek to integrate the proposed features. In this paper we present the serious games currently deployed in the platform and the results of user tests performed in order to evaluate its usability and attractiveness. Overall, subjects reported a positive gaming experience for all the games, registering the highest values in the multiplayer and competition aspects. We intend in the future to test the games on a population with various kinds of limitations.
