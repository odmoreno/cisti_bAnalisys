Aging and technology: Challenges of the 21 st century
ABSTRACT
The relationship between social development, increased longevity and technological innovations is a very current paradigm. The elongation of adult life, the new social risks and the impact of the use of the technologies by the elderly is the object of reflection of this article. It is intended to make a summary analysis on some published studies on the theme of aging and technology. The consequent need of adaptation of the elderly population to the technology guides this reflection in the construction of the right to grow old with dignity and security in the digital society.
