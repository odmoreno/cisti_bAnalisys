CyberRescue: A pheromone approach to multi-agent rescue simulations
ABSTRACT
In this work the authors propose a pure pheromonebased implementation of a CyberRescue agent. In this sense, virtual pheromones are used to represent the agent's internal representation of the world. They can be repulsive or attractive and therefore useful for exploration, collision avoidance and world analysis. The project's goal is to evaluate this approach suitability in the aforementioned competition's context. To accomplish this, the authors have created a fully pheromone-based agent and inserted it in CyberRescue's competition, evaluating its behavior by the contest's rules. This approach yields excellent results in open maps, even when wall placement is complex. On the other hand, the agent's behavior is unstable and limited when it has to cross narrow corridors to explore new areas and find the goal. In the competition's context, it proves itself as being an excellent exploratory strategy with a very low collision rate, while allowing the agents to successfully complete a considerable amount of maps. This article gives an overview of the design and implementation processes, while evaluating each characteristic's benefits and shortcomings.
