ClimApp: A novel approach of an intelligent HVAC control system
ABSTRACT
This paper describes a novel deployment of an intelligent user-centered HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioner) control system. The main objective of this system is to optimize user comfort and to reduce energy consumption in office buildings. Existing commercial HVAC control systems work in a fixed and predetermined way. The novelty of the proposed system is that it adapts dynamically to the user and to the building environment. For this purpose the system architecture has been designed under the paradigm of Ambient Intelligence. A prototype of the system proposed has been tested in a real-world environment.
