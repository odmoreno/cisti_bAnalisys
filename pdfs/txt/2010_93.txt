A system for fall detection: An approach based on cheap sensors
ABSTRACT
The problem of fall detection in elderly patients is particularly critical in persons who live alone or are alone most of the day. The use of information and communication technologies to facilitate their autonomy is a clear example of how technological advances can improve the quality of life of dependent people. This article presents a prototype developed with a low cost device (the gamepad of a known video console) using its Bluetooth communication capabilities and built-in accelerometer. The latter is much more sensitive than other similar devices integrated in mobile phones and much cheaper than industrial accelerometers. Besides its stand-alone use, the system can be connected to a generic remote monitoring system.
