Determination of Compatibility between Activities according EU General Data Protection Regulation: An Initial Study
ABSTRACT
Nowadays an important issue, for an organization to be in compliance with data privacy laws, such as European General Data Protection Regulation. Organizations struggle to reach equilibrium between a dynamic operation of their organization and mitigate the risk of breach in what concerns people privacy rights. The problem that we aim to resolve in this paper is how to develop and manage efficiently privacy principles in an organization without putting at risk its dynamic operation. We aim to contribute to the equilibrium between strong controls and maintain flexible the way people operate on an organization. The drive of this paper is to introduce a compatibility risk matrix to establish a measure of a specific GDPR data protection principle - Purpose Limitation- in accordance with the best practices. This will allow an organization to add new services and verity if it maintains the compliance with GDPR with a minima efforts. In order to address this issue, we will use in our work in Activity theory and capture the scope of the organization. We define scope as a subgroup of activities that belong to the structure of an organization.
