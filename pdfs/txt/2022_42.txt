Using spatial analysis to calculate the incidence of lung cancer in the region of Muriaé-MG
ABSTRACT
Cancer is a public health problem with high morbidity and mortality, that is, the rate of people killed as a result of a specific disease within a given population group, being the second leading cause of death in the world. Lung cancer is the most common malignant disease worldwide. Late diagnosis, with the disease at an advanced stage, decreases the patient's life expectancy. The present work deals with the use of spatial analysis tools to present the spatialization of the incidence of lung cancer, in the microregions assisted by the Hospital do Câncer de Muriaé (HCM), and to map the different staging groups. Therefore, the medical records of patients treated at the HCM, from 2019 to 2020, with a clinical diagnosis of lung cancer, were analyzed. For this, the ETL process (Extract, Transform and Load) presented itself as an important tool in loading the data to the database, and in the step to identify the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on neighborhood information, city and state, contained in the database. Through georeferencing and analysis tools and spatial mapping, it was possible to generate thematic maps showing different relationships between geographic and epidemiological factors of the disease, being an important instrument to support prevention and epidemiological control actions.
