Under the hypothesis of skills development in the accounting field through TAC. The research was developed through a quantitative approach, an empirical-analytical method, with a descriptive type of research under an experimental design based on G1 x O1 and G2 - O2, three phases were defined. In the first phase, the characterization of the existing software tools in the accounting field was carried out. In the second phase the relevance of them was determined. In the third phase, the performance was evaluated to later classify them in a repository. The use of TACs in the classroom by the experimental group resulted in an improvement in their academic performance compared to the control group, strengthening their self-learning processes and facilitating the development of the cognitive functions and skills necessary in the exercise of your accounting profession. Finally, the data obtained were analyzed with parametric analysis techniques by which it was found that the difference in the quantitative results in the academic process between the experimental and the control group was statistically significant, which concluded the success of the experimental treatment.
