Ontological model for classification of diseases in bovines and buffaloes
ABSTRACT
This work presents an ontological model for classifying common diseases with prevalence in herds of cattle and buffaloes. The methodology adopted is based on a literature review. The data extracted from the works reviewed were imputed in the proposed model. The ontological model developed is composed of six main classes, being: Anatomy, Amazon Biome, Diseases, Breeds, Breeding System, and Production Type; The relationships between diseases and its class(es) are also mapped in the model. The ontological structure was created using the Protégé tool - open source framework for building intelligent systems. This work is part of a project that aims to build a framework of semantic resources aimed at supporting animal health care as well as to improve the sustainability of livestock production.
