Multimodal cognitive biometrics
ABSTRACT
Cognitive biometrics represents a new approach in the identification and/or authentication of people using biological signals that characterize the brain's response to certain stimuli, giving a high degree of uniqueness to the individual. In this work, we contextualize the cognitive biometrics in the biometry in general, taking into account how one can measure the performance of a biometric system. We intend to conduct a literature review in a particular area of information security, in order to foresee possible lines of research. Scientific studies show that biological signals captured through electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrodermal responses (EDR), using electrodes placed on specific body parts, guarantee the possibility of authentication of individuals and its identification, in some cases. This can be useful for the most demanding security systems, using these techniques individually or on a combination of different biometric techniques, so that the recognition process is more efficient.
