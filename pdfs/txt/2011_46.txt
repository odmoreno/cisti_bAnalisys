Isastur Modeler: A tool for BPMN MUSIM
ABSTRACT
Despite the evolution that computer science has undergone during the last years, application development hasn't seen such an improvement in the time needed for a software tool to be built, some of it being consumed by the requirements engineering process. Involving the user in the development of the applications via the features that BPM brings can be a solution to this aspect, as the requirements would be specified by the domain experts and most of the difficulties of the requirements engineering process would be avoided. However, business process modeling notations seem to be a little bit complex for domain experts with reduced computer knowledge and their participation in the requirements engineering process turns complicated due to the difficulties derived from learning and using these notations. BPMN MUSIM tries to reduce the number of elements needed in a business process modeling notation to the minimum necessary and thus lowers the difficulties that domain experts experience when modeling their processes. The major problem regarding BPMN MUSIM is that there is no modeling software that enables it use, so we have decided to design and build a process modeling tool called Isastur Modeler that is used for business process modeling with BPMN MUSIM.
