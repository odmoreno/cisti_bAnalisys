In an Information Society where the value of news content in the network is ephemeral and disposable, this article intends to present the issues of understanding and sustainability of information through the informative agglomerating competences of Online Journalistic Infographics (in particular, the cross-linguistic and multiplex narrative), from depth, laterality and informative timelessness and continuum of that composite that accompanies and systematizes the concept of instantaneity.
