Stewart platforms: Contributions to the learning process in problems of orthopedics
ABSTRACT
A new social conscience is created, which will be used by an net society, at local and global levels, crossing both informatics and education contexts. In this sense, several fields of science use Stewart platforms (SP) in order to manipulate objects in 3D environments. The Ilizarov Hexapod System, which correct bone deformities, is also one of SP's contributions. However, teaching IHS operation to orthopedic doctors, who are the key stakeholders in this field, is hindered due to IHS's three-dimensional characteristic. With the support of the Scrum framework, researchers conducted the development of four 3D Learning Objects. These 3DLOs were used in class with eight orthopedic doctors and eleven residents in orthopedics, and evaluated by means of a questionnaire. This study's results reflect on the support framework used and on the effectiveness of 3DLOs to teach the principles of the IHS. Finally, this paper presents the contributions of Scrum framework to the construction of 3DLOs and the effectiveness of this type of learning objects as an instructional mechanism in orthopedics. For that purpose, given the characteristics of the study, the research methodology was based of grounded theory and empirical-descriptive.
