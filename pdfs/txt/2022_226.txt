ABSTRACT
The use of practices that strengthen the software development process has benefited from standards that guide organizations either to self-assess themselves and set an improvement goal, or to adopt the practices that contribute the most to their business. This article describes the use of the CMMI-DEV 2.0 model for the improvement of the process of a financial software project. The methodology used to evaluate the current process against the practices of the model is described, and a series of proposed improvement opportunities that could be implemented in each category are listed. The case study described in this article may be of interest to organizations that are interested in improving their software process.
