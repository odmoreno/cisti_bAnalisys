Tourism planning in natural destinations with the presence of ethnic communities
ABSTRACT
Tourism planning is focused on the traction of tourists to generate economic growth; currently, it is also necessary to understand how host communities are affected by this activity, since negative impacts have been evidenced by displacement, deculturation, and affectation of their dignity, among others, contrary to the main objectives of tourism. Over time, tourism planning approaches have been implemented within the framework of demand growth, supply specialization, change in traveler behavior patterns, economic growth of the tourism destination, and community participation in the productive model, that is, always based on market elements, but none of them identifying the elements of identity and social value, not from marketing but the social fabric, especially in indigenous and black ethnic communities. A documentary review of tourism planning models, indicators of quality of life and wellbeing and the elements of prior consultation and citizen participation for ethnic peoples will be carried out. It is expected that the proposed model will strengthen tourism planning, fulfilling its objective of economic growth through the commercialization of the comparative advantages of the destinations, alerting in the first instance the possible low, medium and high impacts that the traditional villages may suffer, having the possibility of mitigating these impacts through efficient governmental and/or corporate decision making in the territories, towards the community, allowing to establish the degree of importance of the differentiating elements by community, in terms of cosmogonic understanding versus tourism development.
