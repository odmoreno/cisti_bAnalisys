The application of Business Intelligence methodologies and tools: their role in cybersecurity
ABSTRACT
The current need for organizations to correctly collect, process and analyze substantial amounts of data has led Business Intelligence (BI) processes to play a fundamental role in information and knowledge management. As such, it is also necessary to guarantee the security of information and intellectual property, thus leading to the necessity of continuous and permanent focus on cybersecurity policies, implementation and monitoring. To guarantee a correct management of the information, companies must follow updated best practices and industry standarts like those published by the International Organization for Standartization, in order to understand and develop procedures to mitigate and predict possible attacks, as well as the adoption of preventive measures with the performance of tests to systems.
