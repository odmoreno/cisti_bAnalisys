Software platform for promoting activities to combat loneliness
ABSTRACT
Currently, the percentage of people living alone or suffering from loneliness is very large. This problem essentially affects people over the age of 60. Loneliness is correlated with a greater risk of depression and the prevalence of several diseases, which have a very significant cost for the economy. The aim of this project is to develop a platform to support the management of activities for combating loneliness targeted for people over 60 years old. A study was carried out to find and analyze the approaches used to combat loneliness and to promote active aging. At the same time, several interviews were conducted with social workers and other people who work with people over 60 years old. The elicitation and analysis of requirements, based on these elements, was the first step for the development of a platform and a mobile application, which will allow the collaboration of the various actors in actions to combat loneliness and promote active aging. This project helps mitigate the problem of loneliness and proposes new ways to combat it.
