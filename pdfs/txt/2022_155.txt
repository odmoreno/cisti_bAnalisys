Perceived satisfaction and determinants of e-learning success of Bolivian postgraduate users: An empirical study with Smart PLS SEM
ABSTRACT
The transformations that the Graduate Unit of the Faculty of Economic and Business Sciences of the University of San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca is assuming, among which the application of an e-learning system for the development of its graduate programs stands out. In this perspective, evaluating their quality constitutes a fundamental task, so the objective of this research was to establish the perception of satisfaction of the graduate users and the determinants of the success of the system and learning of the Graduate Facultative Unit. To achieve this objective, an investigation was carried out whose approach is of a quantitative type, using the method of the structural equation model with partial least squares (PLS SEM) and the application of the SMART PLS 3 software. An online questionnaire was applied to a sample, with a mean effect size for 8 predictors of 100 Bolivian students from the diploma, master's and doctorate programs in the area of business economics. The results obtained determine that the quality of the collaboration positively influences the use of the e-learning system of the Postgraduate Unit. On the other hand, the quality of the service and the interaction of the students with others determine the level of user satisfaction and this influences the level of use of e-learning, which determines the individual impacts of the users of the learning programs respective training. Therefore, the quality of the collaboration, the quality of the service and the interaction perceived by the students will be the success variables that will contribute to directly increase the use and the satisfaction perceived by the user and, therefore, the individual impact.
