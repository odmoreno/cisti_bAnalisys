Development of the Phonological Awareness Stimulation Programme (PECF) - Digital version
ABSTRACT
In Portugal there are few digital programmes tested and validated to stimulate Phonological Awareness (PA). The Phonological Awareness Stimulation Programme (PECF) was recently developed and validated for European Portuguese (EP). This tool allows that different professionals (e.g. speech and language therapists, kindergarten teachers, teachers and psychologists) work on PA with pre-school age and early school age children. The PECF consists of a tabletop version and a digital version. This study presents the developmental process of the PECF digital version. As future work, a randomized controlled study will be carried out and the comparison between the tabletop version and the digital one will be analyzed.
