Web Accessibility on Online Platforms for the Tourism Sector in Portugal
ABSTRACT
Information and communication technologies provide their users with permanent global connectivity through a wide range of devices and with the Internet as their main support. Currently assuming a very significant economic relevance for a considerable group of countries, the Tourism sector is in the mindset of a digital transformation, in the scope of which a good part of its services is evolving towards ICT and Internet supported versions. In this context, the assurance of universal access to websites (Web accessibility) that support the businesses of organizations in this sector gains special relevance. This article presents an analysis at the level of Web accessibility of 240 websites directly related to the tourism sector, using TAW - Test de Acessibilidad Web evaluation tool. Despite the growing concern to provide more and more inclusive means, the overwhelming majority of websites did not reach the minimum level of accessibility, thus not assuring properly functional access for those who have a disability or limitation.
