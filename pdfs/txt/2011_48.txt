Integration Moodle and academics systems
ABSTRACT
Typically the institutions of higher education (IHE) have difficulty to obtain integrated information from their information systems, since most of them still work with isolated systems and without prospects for providing integrated services. In this context, the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and, in particular, Web Services are promising approaches for the integration of information systems by implementing reusable and interoperable services. The lack of integration between existing academic management and distance learning systems represents a problem for the institutions of higher education leading to the duplication of data and the lack of information coherence. This work contributes to the resolution of some of these problems by implementing a model of integration of the two systems used in most institutions of higher education: Moodle and Academic Management System. The model implemented through Web Services allows Moodle to get automatically information from academic management systems. In this way, we contribute to a significant reduction of Moodle administration tasks, increasing the quality of information that is provided to users, saving time, effort and reducing the number of errors inherent to manual tasks and the manipulation of information. This work also contributes in some way to an increase in the quality of education that is taught in institutions of higher education as it liberates teachers of some administrative tasks, allowing them to devote more time to their primary function. On the other hand, it also provides students with better information about their academic data.
