Mixture Design: Development of a Graphical User Interface for Determining Mixture Parameters
ABSTRACT
Predicting the performance of a mixture is crucial to designing experiences in product development and formulation research. In this work, an application, MDesign, is proposed to construct models in a mixture design with a practical, educational, and intuitive approach. Developed in MATLAB software, the standalone application aims to contribute to the study of mixtures through the definition of multivariate models of different orders, enabling their statistical analysis to verify the robustness of each of those models. Compared to the obtained results from other applications using data experiments published in the literature, the proposed application presents accurate results and good execution. MDesign can be considered an automatic, robust, and valuable tool to support the mixture design in an industrial context.
