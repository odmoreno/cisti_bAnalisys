Perception of digital citizenship among poor adult and elderly users of "Telecentros " in Belo Horizonte
ABSTRACT
Under the hegemony of the information society, info exclusion has increased among poor adults and elderly people. The main objective of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the concept of digital citizenship and its perception among poor, adult and elderly people who use Telecentres in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and to verify if these people participate in the process of social interaction. Following an exploratory approach, a focus group was carried out, which allowed us to collect data in digital inclusion spaces. We also aim to discuss the concepts of digital inclusion, digital citizenship and symbolic interactionism; and verify how these concepts are perceived by poor adults and elderly people, users of Telecentros in Belo Horizonte. Results indicate that there is a predisposition to change social and economic habits and to the social interaction of these people. They demonstrate individuals struggle to acquire new capacities that make them able to reduce the digital gap, which is aggravated by age and socioeconomic conditions, but the way they think and the social behavior they show is still insufficient to consider they completely exercise digital citizenship.
