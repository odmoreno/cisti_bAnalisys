PARADA - Organizational Control for Parade
ABSTRACT
The parade of “Festas in honor of Nossa Senhora d'Agonia”, which is celebrated every year in the city of Viana do Castelo, it is one of the highlights of the traditional festival, that gathers hundreds of people in one giant parade throughout the city streets, this event attracts thousands of spectators. Due to its big dimension, it presents some difficulties regarding its organization. The lack of cohesion of the parade during its course is one of the issues observed that originates several and large empty spaces, which end up to discredit the parade. This paper presents the study the issue related with the Parade's organization/planning, by proposing a solution based on low-cost technologies. In this work we intend to study the problem of empty spaces, proposing a solution based on low cost technologies and evaluating the performance of this solution with its potential users. In this way, a process of collect information was initiated through the observation of the Parade, an interview with the organization and a inquiry of the collaborators and another one for the drivers. Based on the collected information, it is proposed a solution that uses smartphones to interconnect through a mobile application and also a web management application, in order to monitor the Parade and help in suppressing empty spaces. The proposal was evaluated to its potential users through a functional prototype. Usability and User Experience tests were performed and the results were promising. It is intended to validate the proposed solution in the field and extend the proposal to other Parade.
