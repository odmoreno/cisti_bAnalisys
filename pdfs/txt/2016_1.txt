CAOS SUITE: A software tool for the analysis and simulation of chaotic Dynamical Systems. From chaos to hyperchaos
ABSTRACT
The weight of the chaotic non-linear dynamical systems is increasingly more important in sectors such as sciences, engineering, health, and, even, economy. This fact pushes the educative community toward the challenge of designing learning methodologies which enables to understand of the chaotic phenomenon. In this paper we propose an educative software application, easily accessible for medium level undergraduates with some knowledge of the foundations of Chaos Theory. This MATLAB application (called CAOS SUITE) allows students to simulate the system's temporal evolution, to see its correspondence in the phase space, to analyze the convergence problems in the Lyapunov's exponents calculation, and to obtain the complexity degree of the studied system by means of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension. The dynamical systems analyzed cover from basics type Jerk to complex systems with Hyperchaos.
