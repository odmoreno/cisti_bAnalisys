Decision making support system for fin sizing
ABSTRACT
The means and the cooling processes of the heat generating working machinery in industry are essential. Their performance depends on their ability to evacuate generated heat outside the working assembly to the air. A very effective and widespread method often used in engineering employs the fins. They act as a thermal bridge between the heating wall and the reactive medium. However, their design is very complex given the wide range of models employed. The model selection then becomes very difficult for the machine designer owing to the number of often conflicting constraints faced. The complexity of mathematical models of heat transfer phenomena, cannot allow considering an analytical and/or digital solution. This technological gap motivated considering a discussion in the present paper. A decision support system design is proposed. It will enable the user to decide which fin model and dimensions to choose, based on the characteristics and the power of the machine to be cooled.
