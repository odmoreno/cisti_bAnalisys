The collapse of cultural utopia and the birth of techno-utopia
ABSTRACT
The critique of techno science happens as consequence of the implementation of the industrial process of mass production and the consequent conditions of employment of workers, and later with the trauma of World Wars with their concentration camps, with their atomic bombs that taken millions of lives in the course of countless battles. It is in this context later wars that intellectuals and politicians reborn humanistic values. These are reborn from the ashes of a devastated and chaotic world. These resurrected values allow us to distinguish before and after the horrors caused by the world wars. It is in this context that all politicians and intellectuals try to put up as barriers to prevent a new barbarism. That is why it is born in the second half of the twentieth century cyber utopia â€” the utopia of information.
