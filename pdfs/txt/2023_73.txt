Platform Based on Robotics to Aid the Pedagogy of Students with Dyslexia
ABSTRACT
Dyslexia is still highly complex in the national educational environment, especially in elementary school classes. This situation of not offering people with dyslexia a safe and inclusive educational environment is responsible for causing attention deficit disorders and even school dropouts. Searching solutions to this problem, information technology is inserted as a source of resources to help in this endeavor. Thus, the resource seen in this work, which combines Information Technology with robotics, gamification, and a therapeutic vision through applications based on the psychology of form, helps to provide a playful and inclusive resource in the educational environment.
