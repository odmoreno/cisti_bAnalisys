Development of an APP for the functional referencing of the population with visual disability
ABSTRACT
Advances in the field of satellite geo-referencing have allowed the development of new technologies that help populations in conditions of special vulnerability, in this case, with visual disability, a concept that includes people with total blindness and low permanent vision. In Colombia, people with more cases of visual disability are in the central zone, in the case of Bogotá there are considerable cases, according to the number of the population, that require attention in the different localities, for this reason, regulations of inclusion within the social and productive field, as well as alternatives for improving mobility and security. This article is developed within the framework of the research project “Current state of social inclusion of people with disabilities supported in ICT and the development of technological support applications”, which led researchers to the development of technological tools as support a disabled population, allowing the design of functional referencing software that will guide people with visual disabilities in the processes of location, selection and access for the use of the Integrated Public Transport System (SITP) of the city of Bogotá - Colombia.
