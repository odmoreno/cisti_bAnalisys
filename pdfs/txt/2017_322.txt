Environment and models for learning technologies
ABSTRACT
The incorporation of Web 2.0 technologies and resources in higher education institutions and, in particular, in the teaching and learning process, today constitutes an imperative which can contribute significantly to improving student learning results and the quality of education. This article provides a summary of the most notable results of a research project with the aim of analyzing the process of educational integration of Web 2.0 resources in teaching and learning practices. The results are broadly similar to studies conducted in other international contexts. The findings indicate that Web 2.0 resources incorporated some changes at communication and collaboration level.
