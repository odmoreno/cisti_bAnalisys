The Tourism Supply Agentsâ€™ view on the Development of an Accessible Tourism Information System
ABSTRACT
To develop an accessible tourism information system, it is of utmost relevance to consider the requirements of all users. The aim of this paper is to examine the view of tourism supply agents (TSA) on the development of an information system for accessible tourism. To achieve this aim, a questionnaire to a sample of Portuguese TSA was administered to identify the type of data that these users are interested in introducing in the system and the information that they desire to obtain from it. Results show that TSA considered the creation of an accessible tourism information system important and also showed interested in being part of it. Regarding the information to insert and retrieve from the tourism information system, TSA showed interest in aspects related to the accessibility of tourism offers, as well as information related to the characteristics of the accessible tourism market.
