Craft Academy : Design of an e-learning solution for the handicrafts' industries preservation
ABSTRACT
The study presented in this paper consisted in the development of a prototype for an online e-learning platform, with the aim of contributing to the preservation of the material and cultural heritage of Portuguese craft industries. More specifically, through the creation of a technological solution that helps access and pass on the ancestral knowledge of handicraft to younger generations. The research focused on the Design field using methodologies and concepts related with user experience design (UX Design) and user interface design (UI Design), namely addressing crucial steps such as the creation of personas, information architecture, user flows, wireframes, visual identity and style guides. The research's outcome culminated in the creation of a high-fidelity prototype and the performance of usability tests to evaluate and validate the designed solution. The results demonstrated the efficiency of the designed interface and the potential interest of the target audience: young people and more specifically arts and design students.
