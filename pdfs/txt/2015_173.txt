The role of organizational culture in the dynamic relationship between Information Technology and Organizational Learning
ABSTRACT
The Organizational Culture plays a crucial role in the management processes that can, directly or indirectly, influence the success of Information Technology (IT) implementation and use and also facilitate the Organizational Learning (OL). Although the importance of these issues have been widely discussed, there are no studies that investigate the combined effect of IT, OL and OC, particularly from an empirical perspective. Therefore, the objective of this project is to understand the role of Organizational Culture (OC) in the dynamic relationship between Information Technology (IT) and Organizational Learning (OL), in the accommodation segment, in Brazil and Portugal. Based on the literature review, it is postulated that it is through the alignment between the OC and IT will be possible to leverage the organizational learning, which will cause the better firm performance. In this context the research is positioned in the paradigm positivist with quantitative nature. For this purpose will be used a questionnaire to the main manager of each of the selected institutions for research in order to understand the type of dominant organizational culture in institutions and how this influences the dynamics relationship between IT used and the process of organizational learning. The intention is to provide additional insights to managers about the sustainability of competitive advantage resulting from the synergy between IT, OC and OL and fill the gap relating to the relationship of these constructs in the literature.
