Genially: a strategic tool for classroom teaching
ABSTRACT
The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are used as a support within education, so nowadays virtual learning topics are elaborated with educational contents and at the same time used as strategies within the teaching-learning process. The present project is to analyze how Genially can be a tool in the teaching-learning process for teachers. The method to be used is a quantitative approach, since data will be analyzed. Twenty-one afternoon teachers from the Francisco Jos√© de Caldas Educational Unit participated in this project. The results showed that the teachers did not know about the Genially tool, but with the proposal that was presented to them they learned to use it; thus, it is proposed to use Genially as a strategy in the teaching process to motivate the interest of the students.
