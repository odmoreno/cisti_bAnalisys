The (cyber) news headlines on Facebook: The cases of El Comercio and El Universo in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
The writing of headlines establishes an essential activity in the contemporary journalism. However, it also represents a compositional feature hardly investigated by the Academy, despite the functional value it has developed over the last two decades in the digital scenario. Therefore, this study is based on the direct observation of the para textual publications of the Ecuadorian cyber media, El Comercio and El Universo, and their informational development through the virtual interaction network Facebook. For this purpose, the pragmatic characteristics and hypermedia components derived from the cyber news headlines were examined for 184 days to determine the degree of compliance with the formal standardization norms of the Spanish language and the use of the multidimensional attributes of the semantic network.
