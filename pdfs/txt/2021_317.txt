Management of innovation and social networks in tourism companies : Descriptive theoretical approach of its adoption and use
ABSTRACT
Tourism companies are obliged to innovate because tourists are currently more informed and more demanding, therefore, the adoption of new technologies such as social networks is a constant challenge for the industry. In order to obtain a descriptive theoretical analysis of the proposed field of study, a rigorous and systematic SLR methodology is applied that leads to the analysis of the publications made in the last 5 years in the Scopus database. The results showed that the management of innovation and social networks are promoted mainly through co- creation practices where collaboration and knowledge of tourism actors are the keys to a more efficient management.
