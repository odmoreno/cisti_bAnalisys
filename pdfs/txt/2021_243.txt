Development of an APP with IONIC - EDUAPP
ABSTRACT
In a society immersed in innovation and technology, the evidence that the smartphone can take the world to school and transport school to the world is undeniable. Therefore, the use of mobile applications can stimulate the student's motivation and involvement and thus contribute to the creation of new teaching and learning contexts and instruments. Students use smartphones on a daily basis and these can be an incentive for new and creative pedagogical practices. This article describes the development of an app for Android and IOS smartphones, whose goal is to create a repertoire of apps that can be used in the classroom. It is intended that this mobile application will provide teachers with relevant information about the apps that others are using, while allowing to discover, install, try and use them, in the context of the classroom and, at the same time, evaluate them and share examples of good practices in their use. Teachers will also be able to suggest new apps thus contributing to a constant updating of the repertoire.So as to achieve this objective, we turned to IONIC CORDOVA to develop the app, enabling its installation on IOS and ANDROID and its use as WEB APP for the remaining operating systems.
