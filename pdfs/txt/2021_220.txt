Psychoeducational audiovisual intervention for raising awareness of suicidal risks
ABSTRACT
Digital psychoeducational interventions can be used as empowerment and literacy promotion tools, facilitating the identification of symptoms associated with mental illness. Suicide has been considered a serious public health problem, becoming more concerning when it is perceived as the only way out of any difficulties or when it results from psychiatric illness. This paper describes a study, whose aim was to assess psychoeducational intervention "40 seconds", a digital intervention within the scope of literacy in suicidal risks targeted at university students. In order to assess the intervention a workshop was run to understand its impact on participants' literacy before and after watching the audiovisual contents. Results show that there was an improvement of participants' literacy in suicide after watching the videos, which indicates "40 seconds" intervention potential to promote knowledge of suicidal risks among university students.
