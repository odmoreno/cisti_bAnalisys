Design and construction of an electronic doser for disinfection and sanitization in the food industry
ABSTRACT
This work consists on the development of an automatic disinfection and sanitization doser, applied to industries that use chemicals to reduce the percentages of contamination in food and common utensils, integrating actuator devices and sensors to maintain the appropriate values of the chemical Quaternary Ammonium (AmCu) in parts per million (ppm) in a mixture resulting from 2 Gal or 4 Gal, and to diagnose faults or leaks of liquids inside the device by means of temperature and humidity sensors. For the evaluation of the prototype, 40 laboratory experiments were carried out where two variables were measured: the volume of the resulting fluid and its respective concentration of the chemical. In addition, comparison was made with other similar devices demonstrating superiority in terms of portability, ease of use, accuracy and low cost.
