Gamifying Autonomous CPR Training
ABSTRACT
In sudden cardiac arrest, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with emphasis on chest compressions, is a fundamental step in the Chain of Survival. It is of most importance to have good technique to increase the success rate. CPR is less effective, according to some studies, due to the lack of regular training. In this context a system with quantitative feedback for autonomous training was developed. Gamification has become a widely used method for promoting learning in general, it has also been applied successfully in health care professional's training. In this work, it was followed and widely adopted a gamification framework with the propose to include several game related functionalities in an existing CPR autonomous training system. It is expected that this approach will increase training frequency and knowledge acquisition.
