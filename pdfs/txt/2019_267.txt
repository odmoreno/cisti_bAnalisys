Athlete-Trainer Interaction Dashboard in Performance Analysis
ABSTRACT
The article covers the theme of Smart Watches applied to high competition nautical sports, with a focus on the surf market for athletes within the context of competition and training. The underlying surfing competitions are related to the two most known championships from the World Surf League (WSL): World Circuit Tour (WCT) and World Qualifying Series (WQS). At this level of competition, the athlete needs to have a direct communication with the trainer in order to obtain technical guidance or information about his/her performance, including scores obtained during the competition (e.g., wave, competing athletes), technical instructions for correcting maneuvers, urgent messages (e.g., change of board or momentary injuries). The proposed model is extensible to training contexts, where the athlete has to comply with training plans and can receive technical instructions from the coach. The proposed solution was designed for two views: Athlete's view for smartwatch-type equipment and Coach's view for tablet-type equipment. The coach, at land, has the role of an observer of the athlete's performance at sea. The methodology for development of this undergoing research project is based on the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) together with the User Centered Design (UCD) and Design Thinking (DT).
