The urgency of lifelong learning: A study on the learning of information and communication technologies in populations 50+
ABSTRACT
This article aims to address a doctoral research carried out in the senior universities of the district of Castelo Branco in the academic year 2013/2014, whose main objective was to identify the sociocultural factors that influence and condition the option to learn ICT and to know the impacts of this learning on well-being (mental and social) throughout the aging process. Data were collected at 5 senior universities in this district through a questionnaire survey involving 374 citizens (50+ years old) and from interviews to 5 Directors, 5 ICT Teachers and 10 Participants who have already attended ICT training in their respective universities. The results allowed us to verify that the need for communication, the fight against isolation are the main sociocultural factors that influenced the learning of ICT in these participants. The exercise of memory and intellectual skills, participation and inclusion in the digital society and the reduction of loneliness were the most evident impacts on the "mental well-being" and "social well-being".
