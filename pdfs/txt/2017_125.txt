Evaluation of usability in user satisfaction of electronic commerce
ABSTRACT
E-commerce services represent an important and attractive economic sector. Among other factors, the success of this type of service is linked to the satisfaction of its users. Understanding the aspects related to satisfaction is fundamental to establish the quality of these services. The non-functional requirement of usability plays an important role in software quality, and may be related to user satisfaction. With this in view, this research seeks to assess whether usability influences consumer satisfaction of e-commerce systems. For this, a Systematic Literature Review was conducted, which selected primary studies that statistically correlated usability and user satisfaction. The results point out a relationship between perceived usability in e-commerce systems and the satisfaction of its users. In addition, the data obtained in the RSL show that the usability influences the purchase intention and the loyalty of the consumers.
