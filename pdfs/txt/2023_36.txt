Fuzzy Tool for Crowdfunding Readiness Level Assessment for Innovative Projects
ABSTRACT
Stimulating creativity in technological entrepreneurial education leads to knowledge and connection to current trends in the development of innovative technological projects and the creation of innovative start-up and spin-off enterprises. Their success or failure depends on a number of factors such as the market, the team, the technological level of the product, but also on the funding methods, including crowdfunding. The paper proposes a Fuzzy tool for preliminary assessment of the opportunity of crowdfunding campaigns for innovative projects resulting from the stimulation of entrepreneurial creativity through gamification-based education.
