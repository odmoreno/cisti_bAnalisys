Usability and User eXperience of Conversational Systems by Elderlies : A Sistematic Literacture Review
ABSTRACT
Conversational Systems can be used as an assistive technology to play an important role for the well-being of senior audiences. The use of Embodied Conversational Assistants (ECA), physical or virtual, has been used in CS to make interaction closer to reality. The objective of this paper is to identify recommendations for design and evaluation of the usability and experience of ECAs. A systematic review was conducted in the ACM and SCOPUS databases through January 2022 to identify articles presenting recommendations for developing ADEs in elderly populations. Thirty-nine publications were screened for data extraction, of which five were selected. The selected ones presented recommendations that were grouped and classified according to Usability and User Experience (UX) aspects. It was identified 48 recommendations for ECA design, 98 factors for Usability classification and 12 factors for UX classification. The identification of Usability and UX measurement factors for each recommendation is proposed.
