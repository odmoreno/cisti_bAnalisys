Wearable technology model to control and monitor hypertension during pregnancy
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we proposed a wearable technology model to control and monitor hypertension during pregnancy. We enhanced prior models by adding a series of health parameters that could potentially prevent and correct hypertension disorders in pregnancy. Our proposed model also emphasizes the application of real-time data analysis for the healthcare organization. In this process, we also assessed the current technologies and systems applications offered in the market. The model consists of four phases: 1. The health parameters of the patient are collected through a wearable device; 2. The data is received by a mobile application; 3. The data is stored in a cloud database; 4. The data is analyzed on real-time using a data analytics application. The model was validated and piloted in a public hospital in Lima, Peru. The preliminary results showed an increased-on number of controlled patients by 11% and a reduction of maternal deaths by 7%, among other relevant health factors that allowed healthcare providers to take corrective and preventive actions.
