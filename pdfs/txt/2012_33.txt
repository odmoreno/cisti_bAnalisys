MobiSN: A framework for developing mobile social networks in MANET
ABSTRACT
With the appearance of wireless communication networks and the new generation of mobile devices, the access to data transmission networks has become possible anywhere at any time. Today, a group of users may gather in a dynamic manner and set up their own ad hoc communication networks, which are named MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork). In parallel, on the Internet, the use of social networks has soared, where a collection of people with common interests may establish relationships. In this context, this paper proposes a framework called MobiSN with the purpose of helping the development of social networks in an ad hoc mobile network environment. MobiSN provides support for the developer in the creation of the graphical user interface, the Bluetooth communication process and the data persistency layer.
