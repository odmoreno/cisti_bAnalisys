Vectorizing the computation of k-mers
ABSTRACT
In this article, a vectorization model of k-mers is presented and evaluated in order to enable its massive parallel processing on many core platforms. The model is made up of data structures and functions indexed in N-dimensional spaces that facilitate the massive parallelization of the main operations with k-mers. The model was implemented using a set of OpenCL cores, which were evaluated in a heterogeneous CPU/GPU platform using a data set based on the human chromosome number 23. The results showed a maximum acceleration factor close to 5000X.
