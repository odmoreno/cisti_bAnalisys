Network visualization techniques for story charting : The case of a book in Portuguese
ABSTRACT
Visualization techniques have been widely used to analyze various data types, including text. This paper proposes an approach to analyze a controversial text in Portuguese by applying graph visualization techniques. Specifically, we use a story charting technique that transforms the text into a graph. Each node represents a character or main entities, and each edge represents the interactions between characters. We also present several visualization techniques to gain insights into the storyâ€™s structure, relationships between the characters, the most important events, and how some key terms are used throughout the book. By using this approach, we can effectively reveal complex patterns and relationships that may not be easily discernible from reading the text. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our technique in Literary Studies and other fields.
