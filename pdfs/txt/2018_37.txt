Evaluating the impact of the personality traits in the perception of model-driven engineering
ABSTRACT
The identification of the personality traits of software developers is very important to perform teamwork and achieve the objectives set. The characteristics of the individuals with respect to the different personality factors influence the way in which the different tasks that make up a specific methodology are carried out, such as the creation of a domain model in a Software Engineering project. In the present work we present the results of an empirical study that evaluates the relationship between the different personality factors and the perception regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using a Model - Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. In order to determine personality traits, we have used the PEN model, corresponding to the Eysenck's personality theory. Based on this model, we have used a set of questionnaires to identify (a) the levels of Psychoticism (P), Extraversion (E) and Neuroticism (N) of the subjects and (b) their subjective perception regarding the use of a MDE approach.
