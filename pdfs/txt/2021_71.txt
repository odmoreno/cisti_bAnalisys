A tool to support the creation of digital games to promote environmental awareness
ABSTRACT
Illustrating to young people the extent to which human attitudes interfere with the well-being of terrestrial and marine species has been one of the objectives of several environmental organizations such as the United Nations Environment Program, the World Commission on Environment and Development, among others. However, there is a need to make this illustration through mechanisms that facilitate the retention of attention, and the enthusiasm during this learning, hence the need to have playful elements as facilitators of this process. Among the ludic activities, the digital game has been used more and more as a means for information transition, and above all to influence and change behaviors. Making young people create digital games around marine litter with emphasis on plastic pollution and developing them by visual tools, is believed to be a much more engaging mechanism that will boost knowledge and behavior change in relation to this theme. The work focuses on developing and validating a tool to support the creation of digital games to promote environmental awareness, targeting young adults in higher education in the city of Pemba, Cabo-Delgado province, northern Mozambique.
