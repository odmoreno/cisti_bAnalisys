Data-driven decision making strategies applied to marketing
ABSTRACT
Data-driven decision making is increasingly becoming an essential component of marketing practice across all business sectors and receives unprecedented attention in terms of policies and financial support. The purpose of this article is to improve our understanding of data-driven decision-making strategies and focus on a comprehensive view of applications in marketing and related research. As such, we intend to establish a perspective on strategic planning and management of data-based marketing, complementing the understanding through the current literature. By adopting the "data-driven" perspective, marketers benefit from an approach of more and better control over data and a broader knowledge of the organization's data and strategic models in order to obtain relevant decisions.
