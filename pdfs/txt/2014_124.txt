Automatic loops parallelization
ABSTRACT
Identify opportunities for software parallelism is a task that takes a lot of human time, but once some code patterns for parallelism are identified, a software could quickly accomplish this task. Thus, automating this process brings many benefits such as saving time and reducing errors caused by the programmer [1]. This work aims at developing a software environment that identifies opportunities for parallelism in a source code written in C language, and generates a program with the same behavior, but with higher degree of parallelism, compatible with a graphics processor compatible with CUDA architecture.
