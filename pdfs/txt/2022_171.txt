Personality and creative thinking in artists and the idea of their reputation on Social media
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study was to test the existing relationship of the five personality factors called Big Five, such as agreeableness/cordiality, responsibility, openness to experience, extraversion and neuroticism. According to the validations carried out in the exploratory and confirmatory phases, the agreeableness/cordiality factor showed low levels of reliability and a lack of adequacy of its items with its factor, for which the decision was made to remove this latent variable from the structural model. The study was carried out with 112 people dedicated to the visual arts among students and professionals in Arequipa - Peru. The study was carried out in two phases, in the first one the reliability tests and factorial analysis of the instrument were carried out (exploratory phase), using the IBM-SPSS software. In the second phase, the confirmatory analysis was carried out, using the PLS-SEM methodology for this purpose, which is a multivariate method called, Modeling of Structural Equations with Partial Least Squares. The study would reveal that four of the five personality factors (except agreeableness/cordiality), would influence the latent variable creative thinking more than the idea of their reputation on social media in the artistâ€™s part of this research.
