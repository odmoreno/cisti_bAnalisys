ABSTRACT
This article demonstrates that whatever the descriptions of computational algorithms, what they present are some types of heuristics in the computational logic for the optimization of the acquisitions and treatments of information. The information acquired is always stored in digital media, organized in a group with indexing access in any order, which allows them to be related to indexer types of another group in digital media. The methodology is based on the generation of a unique indexing in such a way that the information is ordered hierarchically. Once a single indexing is made into a digital media, the algorithm can describe the order in which the information should be displayed or worked. The result is the availability of the information in a more optimized time in relation to a conventional logic, and always meeting the project objective. The choice of one of the types of heuristics, the indexing ordering and the crossing between digital media leads to the obtaining of a greater or lesser time in the access to the information and in its treatment, where normally the lack of this indexation is cause of delay in access or even of the absence of some data.
