Building a community of practice for engaging stackholders in bioproducts
ABSTRACT
Communities of Practice (CoP) foster learning, transmission and knowledge production in organizations. Due to their characteristics, they can be a way to promote innovation and strategic partnerships around bioproducts. This work aims to develop a CoP that promotes the sharing of knowledge and partnerships around bioproducts between interested parties. To this end, an interview was conducted with an online focus group made up of 10 elements where the domain, community and practice of CoP was defined. A CoP prototype was built on a Moodle platform. This was evaluated by 2 specialists in humancomputer interaction design using a grid with 10 heuristics. In this way, some recommendations for improving the CoP were made, which will serve to bring together interested parties, promote knowledge and serve as a repository of reliable scientific and technical materials in bioproducts.
