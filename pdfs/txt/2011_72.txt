Augmented Reality applied to the teaching/learning environment
ABSTRACT
In the last decades we have witnessed a technological advancement at all levels with particular emphasis in hardware and mobile devices. These became increasingly lighter and cheaper, and transferred from the office to the car, to equipment and other utensils. The amount of (digital) information available in the environment has increased exponentially, requiring a technological response in order to improve and facilitate its access and assimilation. The concept of Augmented Reality acts as a bridge between real and digital inviting to new models of user interaction. The AR incorporation is intended primarily to make systems more usable by decreasing the need of cognitive load inherent to their use. This paper presents a case study, proposing a model for a Learning Object using Augmented Reality, studying the integration of augmented reality and multimedia techniques combined with other conventional materials researching how they may contribute to increase motivation and perceived towards knowledge.
