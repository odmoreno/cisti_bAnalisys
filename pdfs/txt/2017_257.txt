RECREIO: Floss as SAAS for sharing of educational resources
ABSTRACT
The objective of this study was to verify if a development model of Units of Learning (UoLs), supported by UoLs authoring tools, that meet the usability criteria and abstract advanced knowledge in programming language by the developers, effectively provides the use and implementation of such resources by teachers in all areas of high school (in this first phase of the research) with few skills with technology. This is also due to the fact that many teachers consume much more resources and also the difficulties faced by teachers and developers in reusing their resources in other environments because they were initially designed for a specific environment. The method was based on the paradigm of Design Science Research (DSR), which allowed us to understand the problem and solve it creatively from useful artifacts. The three cycles of the research used questionnaires, interviews and documentary collection as instruments of data collection of the first cycle of survey and survey of the problem under study, while the non-participant observation and questionnaires were used in the second and third cycles at the time of evaluations of the system interfaces by users. Suggestions for improvements were implemented in the Recreio, while integrations to the Learning Management Systems (LMS) are being developed. Preliminary results showed the importance of Recreio incorporate tools of authorship of UoLs, preferably, free and online. In addition, users' reports made explicit the need for a space for sharing and dissemination of the resources developed directly in LMS, as well as another space destined for exchanging experiences and learning with courses among users.
