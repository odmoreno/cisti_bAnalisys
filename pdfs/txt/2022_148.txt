Electronic waste management in Ecuador: an analysis based on its determinants
ABSTRACT
This document aims to explore the variables that influence the proper management of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) by Ecuadorian households. For this purpose, data from the National Multipurpose Household Survey developed by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INEC) in 2019 was used. The econometric strategy consisted of a logistic regression model. The results allow us to conclude that age, education levels, having adequate infrastructure and certain pro-environmental attitudes influence the probability of managing electrical and electronic waste generated by households. Our findings are a tool for the proposal of environmental policies that are based on strengthening education, so that households understand the methods of recovery and correct disposal of electronic waste. Regarding infrastructure, local governments should have specialized deposits that receive this type of waste and then channel it to certified companies.
