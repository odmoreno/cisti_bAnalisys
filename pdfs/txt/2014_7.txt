VDI healthcare management: Surgical oncology, management model and formalization of knowledge: Case studies CRC (colorectal cancer)
ABSTRACT
Through the Project Development of a federated infrastructure network for the generation of virtualization services of workstation (FI4VDI, Infrastruture Federation — Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) is intended to establish joint initiatives of R&D+i to reinforc the technological research system — strategic actions regarding innovation in the field of digital economy and society, and the development of a prototype VDI of management and formalization of health data through a Cloud Computing infrastructure based on case studies in different health specialties involved, in particular in the field of Surgical Oncology, on case studies of colorectal cancer — CRC. In Spain, the incidence of this disease in the region of Castilla y León reaches maximum values, with a high rate in the province of León, which implies an annual excess generation data (epidemiological and others), highlighting the need for a management system that allows them access, entry, modification and distribution, with the ultimate goal of creating a system for predicting and intelligent analysis of this disease. Further, genomic sequencing data of registered individuals will be imported, so there is the possibility of developing a future line of research which has the aim to clarify and determine all genetic variants that increase the risk of CRC.
