Labor market insertion in high-skill occupations: how do ICTs play a role?
ABSTRACT
Considering the need to demonstrate the impact that ICTs generate in the Ecuadorian labor market, this research is developed with the objective of demonstrating the effect of skills in the use of Information and Knowledge Technologies -ICT- on the probability of Ecuadorian workers to be placed in an occupation with a high level of competencies. For this purpose, a probabilistic logistic model with a polytomous dependent variable is estimated, where the explanatory variable is constructed according to the complexity and diversity of tasks performed in an occupation as defined by ISCO-08. The results found allow confirming the research hypothesis: ICT skills increase the probability of Ecuadorian workers to be in occupations with a high level of competencies. In addition, there are significant differences between groups (ethnicity and gender) based on ICT skills in the level of competencies performed by workers. This point is not dealt with in depth in this research, but leaves room for future research.
