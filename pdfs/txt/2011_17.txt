Factory templates: A decision support framework for manufacturing processes management
ABSTRACT
In order to develop the new industrial paradigm, it is necessary to explore a framework supported by planning and operational tools. Indeed, it becomes clear that more and more the next factories need to be increasingly more flexible, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt in real time to the continuously changing market demands, technology options and regulations, as well as accelerate the design process and optimise production. Therefore, in this paper a framework capable of supporting the factory planning will be presented based on predefined templates and product requirements. Furthermore, the Factory Templates will allow for process deployment, control and evaluation in real-time.
