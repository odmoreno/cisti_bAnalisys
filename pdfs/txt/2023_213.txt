IS-DASPA: an IoT system for data analysis from soil preparation in agribusiness
ABSTRACT
As in urban centers, the Internet of Things (IoT) is also advancing in the agricultural environment. There is still a challenge that must be taken into account, which is the high cost of acquiring precision agricultural technology equipment, which only large companies and farmers have access to. Thus, this paper proposes the development of an IoT system that can be made at a more affordable price for small agricultural producers. The proposed system indicates in real time the current subsoiling depth during the soil preparation process through a Human-Machine Interface (HMI). This facilitates the identification by the operator who must intervene correcting to the proper depth. In addition to local monitoring, the IoT device does the telemetry readings of the monitored variable to a cloud database, which allows the analysis of this georeferenced data through geostatistics, generating maps that assist in decision making related to cost, operation quality, and productivity.
