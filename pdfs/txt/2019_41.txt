A Reference Model for Personal Process Management (PPM) Systems
ABSTRACT
Decision making in everyday life is one of the key activities that has significant effect in shaping the flow of living, the quality of life, and the effectiveness of completing daily life tasks. Recommendation systems are widespread, being used via various mediums to decrease the cognitive load of these decision-making activities. Personal process management (PPM) is the management of “flow of activities” (processes) in people's personal lives. These processes and their management may have small but also extensive complexities. They range from simple ones such as preparing an anniversary party, applying for a visa, or registering for a course, to complicated ones such as marriage organization or buying a house. In this study, we present a reference model for context-aware mobile decision support systems that consider human factor in managing personal processes.
