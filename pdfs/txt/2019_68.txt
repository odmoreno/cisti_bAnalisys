Relation between deaths due to fall in the elderly population and associated risk factor
ABSTRACT
This research aims to correlate the risk factors pointed out by reports on falls produced by reputed institutions with the information of deaths found in the DATASUS database. This resulted in four predominant factors: biological, behavioral, environmental and socioeconomic, in addition to the presence of culture influence and gender concepts. It was also inferred that there is a major impact of the individual's lifestyle on the possibility of falling, such as sedentary lifestyle, use of polypharmacy or alcoholism. With this, it is concluded that, because it is an accident with multiple influencing factors, it must be combated by multiple agentes. Nongovernmental organizations in partnership with municipalities and religious institutions should inform the elderly population of the fall, its causes and consequences. The Federal Government together with the Ministry of Health must carry out a plan of continuing education activities for health professionals about falls in the elderly and, finally, partnerships between large media and university centers to disseminate to the lay population the real impacts of the fall and its consequences. This must be done so that it can mitigate or even extinguish the relation of the risk factors associated with falls with the death of the elderly.
