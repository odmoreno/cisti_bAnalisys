Open educational resources to support musical education
ABSTRACT
Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching materials, fixed in any support or media, which are in the public domain or licensed openly, allowing them to be used or adapted by others. Although new forms of use and sharing of OER are emerging up all educational levels, incentives to the provision and use of OER by universities and basic education are needed in Brazil. For this reason, this work contributes to the design and distribution of a musical application, created with OER, and available to free use on Internet. The application has activities in Augmented Reality and aims to improve motivation and enthusiasm by students. For the teacher, the application is more a pedagogical resource that can be used free of charge to assist in musical learning teaching process.
