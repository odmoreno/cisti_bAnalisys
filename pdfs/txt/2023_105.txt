Business Intelligence Over and Above Apache Superset
ABSTRACT
This study looks for an alternative to the platforms that are most frequently utilized in business intelligence developments. In order to do this, a literature review on each subject typically addressed during the development of a BI platform was performed. Since it was determined that Apache Superset would be the appropriate platform, experiments are currently being developed to evaluate the platformâ€™s viability.
