Development of a multi-user audience simulator prototype
ABSTRACT
For students who are trained in the distance learning modality, it is imperative to have practice scenarios that allow the development of competencies according to their area of knowledge and even more so nowadays, when access to training sites or real judicial simulation has been limited. The purpose of this study is to present the experience of developing a multi-user prototype for the realization of simulated hearing practices. The methodology followed is oriented to the development of virtual worlds, where the most important aspects to be taken into account to carry out experimental practices in simulated environments between teachers and students are highlighted. It is concluded that the prototype allows in an interactive and dynamic way to execute hearing simulation practices considering the different roles of an oral litigation case. Also, the methodology can be applied in any simulated environment in different areas that require synchronous interaction with role assignment through multi-user environments.
