Unique Authentication Model for the Management and Visualization of Web Components oriented to Services through LMS Platforms
ABSTRACT
Authentication over applications on the Internet, is a performed mechanism by most people to access their personal accounts. Into a educational environment, the LMS (Learning Management System) platforms allow access to academic material with the purpose of strengthening a lot of training processes. However, there are still limitations to access educational materials from different platforms, through a mechanism that allows a step through a single point of access. The following article aims to present the construction and implementation of a unique authentication model that allows mitigating security risks in the credential validation process for entry on different LMS platforms. Finally, a study case is presented where the proposed model is validated, with the purpose of generating a single access point through reliable authentication mechanisms on different LMS platforms.
