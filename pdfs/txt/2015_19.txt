Selection constructive based hyper-heuristic for dynamic scheduling
ABSTRACT
Manufacturing environments require a real-time adaptation and optimization method to dynamically and intelligently maintain the current scheduling plan feasible. This way, the organization keeps clients satisfied and achieves its objectives (costs are minimized and profits maximized). This paper proposes an optimization approach - Selection Constructive based Hyper-heuristic for Dynamic Scheduling - to deal with these dynamic events, with the main goal of maintaining the current scheduling plan feasible and robust as possible. The development of this dynamic adaptation approach is inspired on evolutionary computation and hyper-heuristics. Our empirical results show that a selection constructive hyper-heuristic could be advantageous on solving dynamic adaptation optimization problems.
