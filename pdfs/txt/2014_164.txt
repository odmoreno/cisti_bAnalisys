Teaching requirements elicitation supported by the model blended mobile learning mobility and cloud
ABSTRACT
The increasing number of mobile devices, in day-today of citizens, particularly among young people, leads to new paradigms arising in many areas of activity, particularly in education. As an example of a new paradigm in teaching and learning process, mobile learning supported by cloud environments and Bloom's taxonomy could be appointed. In this paper and in the context of a course of 1st cycle, following the guidelines of courses in Information Systems provided by ACM / AIS, we propose the use of Google tools, aligned with Bloom's taxonomy, the model BML Context Oriented (BML-CO) in a Requirements Engineering course.
