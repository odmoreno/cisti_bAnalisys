Performance management in public Portuguese's hospitals
ABSTRACT
In the first phase of this work we propose to evaluate performance in the extent to which public hospitals that use enterprise performance evaluation methodologies like Balanced Scorecard (BSC), can achieve better results in different dimensions to evaluate the established indicators. The four dimensions of performance evaluation that we are analyzing are the dimension of quality of services, access to hospital care, healthcare performance and economic and financial performance. In this paper, we analyze the results for the degree of fulfillment of the objectives set for the year 2010 in thirty-four hospitals. The analysis shows that only five of thirty-four hospitals completed six or more indicators of the eight indicators that are established each year for these hospitals.
