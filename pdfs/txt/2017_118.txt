Open educational resources and basic education: Relevant dialogues through a recommentadion guide
ABSTRACT
This study is an analysis of the Brazilian production of open educational resources (OER) through the perspective of teacher and student authorship. Starting with a bibliographical inquiry on the theme and a mapping of OER importance and usage for basic education in Brazil, as well as leaning on the history of open education, OER public policies, copyright laws, and Creative Commons, the research proposes the production of a recommendation guide on proper OER use for new concept co-production and co-learning. The production of such a guide can contribute to facilitate OER adoption and implementation processes in basic education. The relevance of applying OER in basic education is justified by its importance as an instrument to improve teaching by favouring co-learning through experience exchanges between teachers and students, between students, and between students and resources, as well as by providing more autonomy to students by allowing them to decide what, when, and through which medium to study.
