ABSTRACT
With increasing competitiveness between companies, decision makers need to have a cross-sectional view of the business, enabling a preventive management able to anticipate problems and exploit market opportunities. The specifics of the financial sector and its influence throughout the global economy make these challenges even more relevant. However, the business performance management systems implementation projects are complex, with a high degree of risk. In order to better understand the specifics of implementing these systems in companies in the financial sector in Portugal, a review of relevant literature, interviews and an online questionnaire were implemented. Through the analysis of the results, was compiled a list of problems and best practices that companies should consider when they wish to start a project to implement performance management systems. Good practices point to a crucial importance in the accuracy and quality of requirements elicitation, setting up an experienced and competent project team composed with distinct profiles of professionals, involving members from different areas of the organization so that they can actively contribute during the project development to its optimization. Focusing on quality and reliability of data, such as development of a useful and easy system to work with, are also relevant factors. This research supports companies that want to explore this area and may serve as a basis for building a set of case-studies and specializations of this issue based on the specifics of Portuguese business.
