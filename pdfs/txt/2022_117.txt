Integrated Language Translation IoT Devices : A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
IoT devices that perform translation are often closed proprietary systems which offer no, or very limited, possibilities of being freely integrated with other IoT devices or systems/platforms and cannot be easily updated. The objective of this paper is to offer a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach to find and synthesise articles on IoT applications in machine translation and potential integration and interoperability functionalities, along with challenges that arise from it. This research identified IoT based projects/devices that implemented machine translation solutions, including ones that resorted to low-cost devices such as the raspberry pi, as well as challenges faced by IoT devices when it comes to integration/interoperability. The findings in this paper provide a way to become more familiar with IoT based machine translation devices/projects and IoT integration/interoperability challenges, as well as proposing new paths for research.
