An Online, Collaborative and Non-formal Intervention Report: : Quick Guide of Portuguese Acculturation for Northeastern Brazilians
ABSTRACT
In an online course, participants are physically distant, but they can have a transactional distance as close as they wish. Taking advantage of the non-formal nature of social networks, an acculturation intervention was implemented, aiming to fade this distance, and promoting the interaction and collaboration of those involved in the process. Based on an initial interview with two Northeastern Brazilians who had recently arrived in Portugal, a set of didactic resources was created that constituted a quick guide divided into 3 modules: "Vocabules and idioms", "Cost of life" and "Climate". This guide was made available by phases over 6 days, through a Facebook group. The intervention also had a synchronous activity with the participation of 6 out of around 20 active participants, through a quiz created on Kahoo!. The analysis of the results makes it possible to state that the intervention achieved satisfactory results for most participants. It is also possible to conclude that the availability of resources aimed at a specific target audience promoted the motivation of the participants and their continuous interaction.
