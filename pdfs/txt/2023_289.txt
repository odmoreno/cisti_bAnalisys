RFID application for attendance control in scientific events
ABSTRACT
This work presents the various development stages of an information system that aims to control attendance at scientific events, through radiofrequency identification. This solution involves both hardware and software. This system was designed to manage the participants of multiple scientific events, process that occurred manually at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Mato Grosso do Sul - IFMS Campus TrÃªs Lagoas/Brasil, demanding considerable time from the organizers and requiring extra effort to certify those present at events. In this solution, each participant receives an RFID tag that uniquely identifies them during an event. In each space of events where activities take place, a case with a Wemos coupled to an RFID capture module will be available. Participants, through their RFID tags (Radio Frequency Identification), register their frequencies in activities in the capture modules, which send the numbers of the tags read to the Wemos microcontroller. Then, the processing of the capture data takes place, a process that involves all the logic of processing and manipulating the reading data before sending the information to the server. The transfer of capture data occurs through a WebSocket server, which makes a bidirectional communication with Wemos customers and ensures that the system is online, to meet their simultaneous requests. After the validation of the captures is finished, the data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database. The $\mathrm{C}++$ programming language and the QT Creator were used for development of the desktop graphical interfaces. Reports of attendance at activities to subsidize the certification of events were made available.
