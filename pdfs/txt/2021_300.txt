The Emerging Discursive Characteristics of Masculinity to Represent Fatherhood in Advertising
ABSTRACT
This study aimed to analyze how the different masculinities construct the discursive characteristics to represent fatherhood in the spots of the Samsung brand. A qualitative study was the approach selected to undertake the study, as a means for understanding the meaning that individuals or groups ascribe to a phenomenon, or experience, in a particular context. Semi-structured interview was the main data collection technique chosen. Through the snowball technique and theoretical sampling, ten parents between 36 to 45 years old (all Samsung consumers) were interviewed. The evidence from this study indicates that family conditioning and new manifestations of masculinities contribute to changes in paternal representations, granting previously unseen characteristics for the construction of an empathic advertising discourse close to parents.
