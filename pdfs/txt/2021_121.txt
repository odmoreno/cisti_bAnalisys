Transforming physical enterprise into a remote organization : Transformation impact: digital tools, processes and people
ABSTRACT
This paper aims to define a problem to be studied and summarize previous research work done. Remote work or telework enterprise model has been a growing trend. The Covid-19 pandemic forced businesses to adopt a temporary remote-working mode. Now managers are investigating whether this "new" working-mode is, or not, a better approach than the traditional working mode known as the "office model". The proposed framework will support the transformation process from a physical into a remote work model supported by applying digital tools and methods. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this work aims to help business decision makers to decide which organizational model they should adopt after Covid-19: full-remote; "hybrid" or partially remote; or physical, also known as "going back to the office". A simple and pragmatic framework is proposed to help organizations: understand if it's possible to transform a business from a physical ("at the office") to a full or partial remote model; define the main goals of this transformation; create a simple template to map the new digital enterprise architecture in terms of tools, data management, business processes and human resources (job functions and digital skills).
