La educación superior en españa y las redes sociales: Instituciones públicas versus privadas
ABSTRACT
The aim of this paper is to analyze the social capital importance in higher education institutions, public and private. For this purpose, we studied the importance of the main Spanish universities, according to the Ranking Web of Spanish Universities-Webometrics-(3 public and 3 private) in Facebook. Although the importance of Facebook in education has been demonstrated, there is little research using it as a media. The results reveal a professionalization of the use of these tools by public universities, creating new opportunities, while private universities fail to achieve this level.
