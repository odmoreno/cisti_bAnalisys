Recommender systems in mobile apps for health a systematic review
ABSTRACT
This paper aims to identify and analyze recommender systems developed for the health area, available in mobile applications. Therefore, literature was reviewed systematically from ACM, IEEE, Springer and Science Direct databases. 1006 studies were found, eight of which met the eligibility criteria. From the chosen studies, only one was not applied to the areas of nutrition and physical activity. The recommender techniques adopted were Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering. The main mobile device identified was the Smartphone and the Operating System was Android. After analyzing the results, it was possible to realize that, although they are widely used in e-commerce, recommendation systems do not have many mobile healthcare applications, and the existing ones are recent.
