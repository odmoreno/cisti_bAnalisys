A student look on the use of virtual learning environment tools in the face to face teaching learning
ABSTRACT
Education in higher education at the beginning of the 21st century requires the use of online environments integrated to face-to-face classes. This practice favors the personalization of dynamics for students' teaching-learning process. This paper is part of a larger research carried out in a Brazilian Salesian institution of higher education on the use of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) in the training of undergraduate students. It presents the vision of ninety students who used an institutional VLE. Through an action research, it was observed that the students note the necessity and wish an improvement in the use of VLE. It is concluded that there is a need to maintain the action-reflection-action movement in the teacher's formation, strengthening the listening to the students about several possibilities of using VLE in higher education, that contemplates the student protagonism and his/her capacity of solving real problems still in the moment of formation.
