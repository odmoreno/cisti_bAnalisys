The Doei mobile app
ABSTRACT
Smartphones have changed the paradigm of how people get services, access information, and connect with friends and family. Mobile devices have transformed the global reality with the mobility and unlimited people connectivity. The purpose of this article is to present the use of a mobile application to facilitate the process of information flow between institutions that provide social assistance to children and adolescents within the Distrito Federal, providing communication with people who are likely to collaborate with donations. For the application development were used the Challenge Based Learning and Scrum methodologies. The Doei app was developed in iOS and is available for free download at the App Store. It is concluded that the awareness of people to engage in the social good is the great challenge of this application, considering that the technology only allows to mediate the interaction of who needs with those who have items to be donated.
