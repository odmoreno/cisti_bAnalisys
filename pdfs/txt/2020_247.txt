Teaching-Learning Framework Based on Case Studies for the Agile Implementation of Geospatial Analytics Projects
ABSTRACT
This article describes a proposal about a teaching-learning framework based on case studies, that includes necessary resources of foundation and practice to address geospatial analytical projects with an agile implementation approach. Understanding the concepts, practice, and technologies with case studies allow students to assemble and go in-depth their previous knowledge, as well as effectively achieve the acquisition of competencies and skills necessary to lead or participate in the implementation of real geospatial analysis projects. Based on discoveries found in the state of the art, and a non-probability sampling survey (it included specific questions about geospatial analytics learning and geographic information systems learning), teaching-learning framework for a course is proposed, it is structured in 5 modules, that cover from the description of information products until the display of dashboards to visualize the behavior of data as a mechanism for decision-making. Each module is formed of one or more case studies, a foundation guide, and a practice or praxis component that includes the use of technological tools.
