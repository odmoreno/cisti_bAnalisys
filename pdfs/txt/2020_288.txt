Accessible statistical charts guidelines for people with low vision
ABSTRACT
Low vision is the most prevalent visual impairment worldwide with more than 1.2 billion people having some of their symptoms. However, no specific guidelines have been developed to meet the needs of these users in many areas, because their specific needs have not been considered. One of these areas is the design and creation of statistical charts, focused so far on blind people or people with severely limited visual faculties. Based on a review of the literature and a previous work developing of a set of heuristics, this work includes a set of guidelines for the creation of accessible statistical charts for people with low vision.
