Training based on a 3D virtual world as a didactic tool for computer learning processes
ABSTRACT
Virtual worlds have become everyday, their use ranges from entertainment to simulation of real scientific environments, they have been increasingly incorporated into teaching to complement the classroom. A methodological change is required to allow a method focused on content and the teacher, one focused on e - activities and the student. This article exposes the results and conclusions of a research research process by incorporating a virtual 3D world without immersion as a didactic tool to support the silver activities in the classroom of university students in the computer science academic space. The research is specified under an empirical-analytical method, with an experimental design, based on G1O1 X O2 and G2 O3-O4. The high levels of interaction by the experimental group of students with the virtual 3D world of indicative learning improvements in academic performance compared to the control group, because their self-learning processes are strengthened. In addition, the data detected will analyze with parametric analysis techniques by which the difference of the quantitative results in the academic process between the two groups that are statistically significant is verified, which concludes the success of the experimental treatment.
