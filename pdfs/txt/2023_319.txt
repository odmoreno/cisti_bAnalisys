Artificial Intelligence as a booster of a Business Intelligence System to help the recruitment process : Business Intelligence, Human Resources and Talent
ABSTRACT
This article aims to better understand how the process of Recruitment and Selection works in the area of Human Resource Management, having as a key tool and differentiator, Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Human Resources area has currently been evolving towards the application of AI in the Recruitment and Selection process (R&S), with the purpose of restricting fields of competencies or skills and optimizing time in data analysis. AI, on the other hand, has had a huge expansion in the last years, in several areas. Because it is an advantageous tool, many organizations are already starting to adopt this method in order to enhance their organization internationally (thus revealing AI to be a key tool). This transformation in organizations, with the application of AI, is mainly the result of data that are generated in Information Systems, often entered by the candidates themselves at the time of Recruitment.
