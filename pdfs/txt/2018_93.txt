Harvesting opinions in Twitter for sentiment analysis
ABSTRACT
Sentiment analysis is a very popular technique for social network analysis. One of the most popular social networks for microblogging that has a great growth is Twitter, which allows people to express their opinions using short, simple sentences. These texts are generated daily, and for this reason it is common for people to want to know which are the trending topics and their drifts. In this paper we propose to deploy a mobile app that provides information focusing on areas, such as, Politics, Social, Tourism, and Marketing using a statistical lexicon approach. The application shows the polarity of each theme as positive, negative, or neutral.
