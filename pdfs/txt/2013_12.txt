GIDERAS: Regional spatial data infrastructure and sectorial applications manager
ABSTRACT
SDIs allow the gathering of technical and organizational elements needed to enable the usage of territorial based information in an interoperable way. However, the cost of managing an SDI is high and the expertise level required is too specialized which, combined, hamper its maintenance and operation. This work, still in progress, presents a proposal for a manager for a regional level SDI, free software based, following the European INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) directive principles and complying with OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards. This CMS (Content Management System) for the SDI will shield the user from the inherent complexity and ease the creation of innovative services and the integration of cross-sectorial applications for a given region, using the geographic information generated by each municipality, as well as provide data for sibling SDIs (inter regional) and parent SDIs (supra regional).
