A Business Intelligence System for Fisheries Surveillance
ABSTRACT
The volume of data related to operational activity, produced and exchanged among the several Portuguese Navy naval units is high and diversified. The way each naval unit currently collects and processes data makes difficult to consolidate information in the process of analysis and decision making. This work describes the design of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution aimed at obtaining a unified view of operational information from the Navy. For this purpose, it was necessary to conceive, design and implement a system that would allow the collection, treatment, integration, consolidation, analysis and visualization of the data contained in the operational data shared by naval units, in order to generate information relevant to a more effective and efficient decision making. The Business Intelligence system presented is based on an analytical processing system whose data is transferred to a data warehouse and then to a data mart. The solution of this system was validated through a survey applied to target users. The survey responses allowed to gather important information with the purpose of improving the practicability and usefulness in future iterations with the BI solution developed.
