Materials for a course in Calculus on several variables: An example of inter-university collaboration
ABSTRACT
Universities today offer many courses where the study materials can be obtained online through different mechanisms. The terms e-learning and b-learning are being overshadowed by u-learning (ubiquitous learning), since the learning scenario is any place and any device that can be used to get the materials. The task of preparing the appropriate materials in this new context cannot be addressed individually and, consequently, international collaborative process can be very fruitful. The main goal is to adapt the study materials for using in several Universities, with official recognition for any University involved in the collaborative process and with agreements with other Universities interested in the use of such materials. We will present an ongoing experience which involves the National Technological University (UTN) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Spanish universities: Salamanca University (USAL) and Pontificia Comillas University (UPCOMILLAS) in Madrid. The authors of this paper have updated a virtual Multivariable Calculus course, hosted in the virtual learning environment STUDIUM to be used by the students from the three universities.
