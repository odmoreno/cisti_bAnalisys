Semantic technologies for using portfolios as a guide for learning in higher education environments
ABSTRACT
At present, many human activities are influenced by the use of information technologies, undergoing major changes to adapt to them. However, in the field of education, the changes that have occurred are not enough to break with the classical learning schemes and there are lot of voices that are demanding radical changes in this context. Mainly one of the fundamental characteristics that educators has been working in is the need to adapt learning to the particular characteristics of the students in a sort of personalization of learning. This work proposes a conceptual framework that supports a software tool for the personalization of learning into technological environments, using semantic technologies such as ontologies and the portfolio concept. The latter is used as a tool to monitor learning.
