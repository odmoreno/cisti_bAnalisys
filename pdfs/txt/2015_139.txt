Social networks sites adoption for education: A global perspective on the phenomenon through a literature review
ABSTRACT
The current level of technological evolution and the mass use of social networks sites (SNS), both by individual users and by organizations, brings to light a window of opportunity for the use of these technologies in educational activities. By analysing the existing scientific literature that focus on the adoption of SNS both at individual and organizational level, we were able to identify a gap with regard to the use of these technologies for educational purposes, making room to the need of creating a global perspective on the phenomenon through a systematic literature review. In this article we present a global characterization on the adoption of SNS for educational activities, and for that we addressed not only the perspective of educational institutions, but also the perspective of both students and teachers. Some final thoughts on future work are also presented in the final section of the article.
