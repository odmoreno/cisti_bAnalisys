Interrupt emission or ask if TV viewer wants to see
ABSTRACT
The participatory design process aims to ensure that a product or service under development achieve the needs and expectations of its target population. This process promotes highest levels of accessibility, acceptance and use of the developed solutions. This is even more relevant when the target audience is the elderly. Interactive television applications can resolve some constrains that seniors feel when accessing informational content. So, this paper reports the field work of data collection and analysis, that aim to define the best way to interrupt the television broadcast in an iTV platform addressed to Portuguese seniors. To this end, participatory design sessions were organized in a focus group format where participants' preferences were collected. In this way, the preference fell to the imposed view, and these results must be confirmed at the time of the tests in real context.
