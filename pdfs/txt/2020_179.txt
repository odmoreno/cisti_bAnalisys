MPT.Br Maturity Model: implementation in a telecommunications company
ABSTRACT
Since at least 15 years, software testing has been one of the areas of software engineering that is increasing its importance in many organizations around the world. Due to this, guides, standards, and maturity models, such as the Brazilian Test Process Improvement model (MPT.Br), are gaining visibility to ensure that a company or organization, even a small one, has a quality level in their testing processes. Such models are important to ensure customer satisfaction and quality analysis of business processes in the production of a system. Given this context, this research aims to present the implementation of the MPT.br (in the first two maturity levels) in a telecommunications company in Brazil to present the benefits of defining the software test process according to a maturity model. To achieve the research goal, we are using a research method called action-research, which is based on empirical studies in software engineering. As results, we expect that this deployment in the company will contribute to a significant improvement in its testing processes, thus contributing to the improvement of the entire organization.
