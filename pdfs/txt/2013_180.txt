Digital games in Catalan classrooms: Teachers point of view
ABSTRACT
This paper explains the work that we have been doing related with what teacher think about digital games in the classroom. The main objective is to discover and understand why Catalan teachers in general are not using digital games. The paper it is based on the digital game Miquel Crusafont that we have developed. Observation and in depth interviews has been done with primary school teachers in order to have attitudes and teachers point of view. As a results of our work we present several teacher barriers to digital game use, for example nobody of teachers reported learning about digital games during preservice training, or that almost all of teachers reports that parents are not supportive of digital games use at school or in home.
