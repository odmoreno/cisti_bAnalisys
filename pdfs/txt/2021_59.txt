Co2 emissions, High-tech exports and GDP per capita
ABSTRACT
This research shows evidence of the relationship between exports of high technology products as a percentage of total exports, as well as Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, in Co2 emissions. To show this relationship, information from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru was used. The results show that high-tech exports meet the inverted U of the environmental Kuznets curve, that is, over time with this type of export, the impact on emissions decreased, while GDP per capita has an increasing relationship) In other words, emissions continue to increase. As a recommendation, we highlight the importance of the production of high-technology products, since a productive economy tends to develop due to the effects of increasing returns that are the result of an economy of scale.
