Management model for Ecuadorian micro-enterprise sector
ABSTRACT
This article is a quantitative research with a descriptive-applicative methodology. The sample considered for the study is 229 tourist micro-enterprises of the canton of Loja. The management model developed is based on the methodology of competitiveness of the IDB (Inter-American Development Bank). It consists in eight dimensions and seventy variables that determine in the first instance the level of competitiveness of the micro-enterprise sector, as well as by sub-activity. Also we design a competitive scenario simulator. The results indicate that the micro-tourism sector, in the canton of Loja, has a low level of competitiveness (38%) as well as the sub-activities "accommodation" (40%) and "food and beverages" (35%). The "travel agencies" present better results when obtaining a level 55% that corresponds to medium competitiveness. The management model for the micro-enterprise sector in Ecuador is a derivation of the macro project "Research to configure a model of tourist cluster for Loja-Ecuador based on sustainability, social entrepreneurship, creative economy and inclusion". The objective is a model business strategies that optimize the promotion of tourist destinations in the region. Under these premises, this research seeks to enhance the micro-business tourism in the canton of Loja and replicating it in other productive sectors of the twenty-four ecuadorian provinces.
