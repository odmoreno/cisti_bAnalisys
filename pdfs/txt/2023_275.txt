Chaos Engineering Tool Analysis
ABSTRACT
Micro-service based systems are nowadays the main choice for implementing complex systems, due to the advantages they offer over traditional monolithic systems. However, the distributed and modular nature of these systems makes it important to analyze their resilience in the face of degradation in the behavior of the network or of individual nodes. However, the structural and functional complexity of these systems is typically very high, makes this analysis difficult. Chaos Engineering proposes to solve this problem by carrying out experiments where the system behavior is analyzed under the presence of injected disturbances, such as network congestion or limitation of computational resources. In this work, we analyze and compare the characteristics of several chaos engineering tools, to determine which one is the most adequate option to implement this approach in a conventional microservices system based on Kubernets uising the Kafka broker.
