Guideline Proposal for Quality Evaluation of for Research in Education Research in Software Engineering
ABSTRACT
Context: The lack of rigor in research in Computer Science Education, including Software Engineering, has already been discussed and examined in previous researches of the literature in both the theoretical and methodological aspects, which may result in questionable evidence. Aim: Improvement of planning conditions for research in Education in Software Engineering through a Guideline. Methodology: To achieve this objective, a Systematic Literature Review will be carried out to ascertain the gaps found in the literature in Education in Software Engineering, in addition to Interviews with researchers in Education in Software Engineering to report the problems found in research. From this, a Guideline will be modeled using the method Grounded Theory. For model validation, a Survey and Focus groups with researchers in education in Software Engineering. And finally, apply it in a Case Study with researchers in Education in Software Engineering to present the practical contributions of the proposed Guideline.
