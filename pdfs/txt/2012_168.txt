SpineSeg: A segmentation and measurement tool for evaluation of spinal cord atrophy
ABSTRACT
Spinal cord atrophy occurs in several pathologies. Measurement of atrophy patterns from magnetic resonance (MR) images improve the neurologists's understanding of these pathologies and provide reliable means to distinguish between pathologies with similar symptoms. Spinal cord measurements from MR are complicated by spinal cord curvature, patient movement, MR resolution, lack of reproducibility in interactive methods and the need of pathology-specific MR protocols. In this work we present SpineSeg, a tool that combines image analysis techniques to achieve reproducibility in spinal cord atrophy measurements without requiring pathology-specific MR protocols.
