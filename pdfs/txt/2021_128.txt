Framework for Creating Outdoors Augmented and Virtual Reality
ABSTRACT
In this article we propose the architecture of a system in which its central objective is focused on creating a complete framework for creating outdoor environments of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) allowing its users to digitize reality for hypermedia format. Subsequently, there will be an internal process with the objective of merging / grouping these 3D models, thus enabling clear and intuitive navigation within infinite virtual realities (based on the captured real world). In this way, the user is able to create points of interest within their parallel realities, being able to navigate and traverse their new worlds through these points.
