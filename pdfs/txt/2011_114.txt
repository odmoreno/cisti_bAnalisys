Designing architectural images for small screen devices in function of user experience
ABSTRACT
The development of technology has always influenced the visualization experience. Both static and mobile devices are a general tendency to maximize the size and screen resolution in line with the intrinsic ability of technology to generate high-resolution images and create an immersive scene. Problems arises when the size or screen resolution is reduced or the amount of information to show increases. The architecture framework is a clear example where the visualization and evaluation of the information is more critical. In this paper we performed a user study' focused on evaluating the features of the digital images related with architectural framework viewed on mobile screen in order to improve the adaptation of different type of images to different type of users.
