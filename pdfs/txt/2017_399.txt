The advertising agencies in Galicia. Economic financial analysis
ABSTRACT
This study presents the economic and financial analysis of a sample of Galician advertising agencies during the period 2013-2015. The paper examines the main economic and financial indicators that will allow us to assess these companies. We also carry out a comparative study of the most relevant indicators of this activity in both Galicia and Spain. Data correspond to financial statements of a sample of the advertising agencies of Galicia. Data were collected from sectorial reference reports of the Consorcio de la Zona Franca de Vigo (ARDAN). The results show that, in general, indicators of the companies' situation in this sector in Galicia are below the average of the Galician companies and of those that develop this activity in Spain.
