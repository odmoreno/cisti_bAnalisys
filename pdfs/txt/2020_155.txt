The fourth industrial revolution, an opportunity for Civil Engineering
ABSTRACT
Since the last decades, development in technology and innovation has been the machine of the industrial transformation around the world, giving way to a new industrial revolution era called Industry 4.0, lending to improved productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of industry significantly, by changing the perspective of consumer market in a globalized world today. However, despite technological changes, industry of Civil Engineering has continued working as the last century, would depend significantly on manual labor, classical mechanics and, old operational and commercial models of the past century, resulting in a low productivity. For Civil Engineer it is time to takes advantage of new industrial revolution and begins to make a change in the traditional manual processes of production gradually, to move towards a digital and autonomous production in all its processes, from planning and design stages, until construction and maintenance stages. All these changes must be aligned with clear government policies in technology, innovation and development, creating new educational incentives and attract new talent to further develop technological skills in future professionals required by construction industry.
