ABSTRACT
Digital evolution requires improvement in all sectors, and supply chain management is no different. With the fasten progress of digitalization and with data use and storage, companies can take major decisive steps to achieve market share through the advantages of information technology. Based on the literature review, as well as on the investigation of studies carried out empirically, it was possible to identify the advantages and barriers to digitization in supply chain management. The use of Business Intelligence systems in that process demonstrates positive and encouraging results within an area of growing interest. In a study conclusion, we obtained confirmation of a remarkable competitive advantage in companies that use BI integration and supply chain management, however, there is still a long way to go in systems updating and people involved in the processes rooted in the companies. The development process proved to be advantageous, as long as there is effective participation and motivation of the involved managers.
