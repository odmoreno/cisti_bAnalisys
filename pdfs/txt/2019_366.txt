IoT-Based Systems for Improving Older Adults' Wellbeing: A Systematic Review
ABSTRACT
Physical, social and psychological wellbeing is one of the most critical issues among older adults' population. Several Internet of things (IoT)-based systems have been developed, in the last 8 years, for improving older adults' wellbeing and support an autonomous and healthy lifestyle. This paper presents the results of a systematic review, aimed to understand how IoT and IoT-based systems have been designed and used, for the past 8 years, for improving the wellbeing of older adults. A total of 173 studies2, published between 2010 to 2018, were selected for review. Results show that the selected studies are mainly related to healthcare and social networking applications, and involve sensors, cloud computing, fog computing and advanced communication networks.
