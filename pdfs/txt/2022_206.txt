Real Time Geolocation System for Livestock based in LoRa
ABSTRACT
This work proposes the design and implementation of a cattle geolocation system using LoRa communication technology, with the ability to transmit position data in real-time. The system is intended to mitigate livestock theft or loss of livestock through the implementation of several functions. In addition, the system can integrate a virtual perimeter and generate alerts when nodes (cattle) are outside the established fence so that the rancher receives a notification via an application or email. In addition, the system has an IoT platform, a mobile application, and a webserver to visualize the location data and the status of the collar of each node. Finally, the system was validated in a real scenario, demonstrating its feasibility.
