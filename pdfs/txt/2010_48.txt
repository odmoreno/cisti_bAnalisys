An open software architecture for learning support processes for people with intellectual disabilities
ABSTRACT
Intellectual disability is often accompanied by other disabilities such as visual, auditory or motor. The mixture of these disabilities in differents degrees, become each people who have intellectual disability in an individual with very specific needs. The software tools used to support training and education are usually generalists and customization and/or expansion is often a complex process or simply impossible. Being a relatively small group, people with intellectual disabilities are not taken into account when defining the objectives of such support systems software. This paper presents the architecture of an open software platform for the development and use of educational support activities that can be customizable and scalable to service the group of people working in the care of people with intellectual disabilities.
