PlantUMLGen: A tool for teaching Model Driven Development
ABSTRACT
The demand for professionals dedicated to software development continues to increase. The architecture analysis and detailed design are part of the key efforts for the correct development and continuity of the solution. The teaching of software engineering still has many challenges to solve. One of these challenges is the teaching of software design, since the efforts made during the course often end up in a dead document when moving on to the construction phase. This problem also occurs in the industry. The reviewed works show different approaches to solve this problem. The objective of this work is to propose a tool based on the model-driven approach to create class diagrams and transform them into the source code. Also, you can make changes to the diagram during construction stages and stay in sync with the code. The results show an encouraging experience with the use of the tool by students of the software design course during an academic semester.
