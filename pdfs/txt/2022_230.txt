Student Dropout in Information and Comunications Technology Careers
ABSTRACT
Student dropout is a phenomenon that affects all universities and a topic of interest because of the negative effects on the student, the family, and the university. Universities make efforts and implement tutoring and support programs to retain students, however, they do not achieve the expected results. This phenomenon is conditioned by a set of factors that must be known to be taken into account. This article presents the results of a bibliometric analysis using the SCOPUS database to determine aspects that influence student dropout in careers related to information and communications technologies (ICT). The results show that the factors that stand out in the studies are: age, gender, sense of belonging, academic performance, performance in previous studies, motivational, organizational factors, among others. Knowing these factors will allow us to determine their influence on student dropout.
