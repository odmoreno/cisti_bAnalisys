Microdata with Schema vocabulary: Improvement search results visualization of open educational resources
ABSTRACT
Open Educational Resources (OER) are published massively through websites, but regular users search educational content directly on the Web by using search engines and not on specific OER websites. In this context, the search and location for OER that match users' needs, including those with disabilities, is a key aspect to enhance their use. Currently, the results presented by the search engines do not contain relevant information to guide the users' exploration decision. Therefore, they must verify each resource until they find the right one, which demands an unnecessary effort. This situation becomes a critical issue if users are people with disabilities. The use of structured markup incorporated in the web content is a feasible strategy that can be used to improve the information displayed in the search results. This embedded marked is done through semantic annotations that can be processed by search engines to understand the meaning of the content fragments and provide users with enriched information in the search results. In this paper, we propose the use of a set of properties from Schema vocabulary to adequately describe OER and their accessibility properties, so that they can be used in microdata annotations.
