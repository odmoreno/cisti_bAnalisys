Web-based scientific computing, a little explored field an engineering problem: Pneumatic transport
ABSTRACT
Web-based computing makes calculations available to any user just by means of a browser, i. e., without installing any software in the user's computer, which thus does not need any especially high computing power or specific operating system. As a mere illustration, an Engineering problem in pneumatic transport is addressed, to determine the minimum transport velocity, as needed in some industries. This determination is made available to any user through a web-based executable program made by the authors that computes the velocity, following common theory. This study is an instance of computing over the Web, a way of computing that employs exactly the same executable programs as classical computing, these being typically the hard task in most Engineering and other problems. This type of computing, with the corresponding tailored executables, can be used to solve innumerable other problems. This web-based technique also facilitates cooperative work, given the current ease of worldwide communication. We find it to be a comparatively little explored field of the Web.
