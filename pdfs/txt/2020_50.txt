Revocation Mechanisms for Academic Certificates Stored on a Blockchain
ABSTRACT
Applications built on blockchain technology face many challenges, namely when they perform corrective operations on their databases. Unlike immutability, which is characteristic of a blockchain, corrective operations must be done without altering the existing data and guaranteeing privacy. Such conditions, make this task more complex for this kind of system. This paper discusses an approach to this problem. This approach is applied in a real domain. We propose an application in the higher education area, which uses the blockchain to issue academic certificates and proposes a mechanism to revoke digital diplomas that may have been issued incorrectly.
