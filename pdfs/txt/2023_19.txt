Web Information System for the monitoring and characterization of the ground movement of seismic sources in Chiriqui province
ABSTRACT
Seismic movements frequently occur in the Republic of Panama, mainly in the province of Chiriquí. Currently there is no system that stores the data generated from the movements and that allows timely decision-making. It is in this sense that this research work is carried out, which has in turn allowed the development of a Web information system, it has been developed within the framework of the subsoil characterization and ground movement project through a sustainable collaborative work network in Chiriquí (GeoData). Through the system developed, it was possible to collect information that has been obtained in the field, by going to different points in the province. It works so that both researchers and students can carry out various academic studies, thus establishing a new source of analytical information. The results obtained when executing the system are evidenced from the design process, determination of functionalities, requirements analysis and the final platform.
