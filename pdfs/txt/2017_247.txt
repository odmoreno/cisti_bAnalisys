Organization of the process areas of CMMI-Dev v1.3 level 2 through of its dependencies
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the software process improvement is implemented by organizations through various standards models to obtain quality software. According to reports from the SEI, indicate that CMMI-Dev through the IDEAL model is the most used reference in the implementation of software improvement processes with respect to other models. In this context, in the reports published in the year 2016 by the CMMI Institute, detected a 19% growth in evaluation applications was identified through the SCAMPI-A method. However, these results show that not all organizations achieve the desired maturity level, as this model is not formal method because is based on the experience of the Evaluation Leader and the audit team in the implementation of software processes according to the model CMMI Dev v1.3. This paper proposes the organization of the process areas of the maturity level II of the CMMI-DEV v1.3 model, according to through of its dependencies. This allows for the improvement of the probability of success in obtaining the level prior to SCAMPI evaluation.
