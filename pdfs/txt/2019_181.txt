Pro(g)NATURAâ€”Scratch in Articulation with Education in Nature
ABSTRACT
Literature reveals that Scratch software may have a strong influence among the acquired competences by students in classroom. On the other hand, a systematic and long contact with nature has benefits for health care, wellbeing, cognitive, motor, emotional, language and environmental responsibility development. This work aims to develop an intervention model related with Student Profile at the end of the compulsory education. In this way we started the PRO(g)NATURA, where the adopted methodology is focused on student's motivation and interests, articulating education, nature and Scratch programming software, developed in the curricular flexibility scope for the 1st year of Basic Education. The adopted methodology is a symbiosis of several methods and techniques described in the literature which intends to relate and motivate students in individual ways supressing their school adaptation problems, community insertion problems and concepts acquisition. With this program we intend to evaluate knowledge development impact (mathematics and mother language), attitudes and values (related to knowledge and civic formation) and abilities (cognitive, emotional and practical), as well as in the school community (students, professors and families). There is a strong social inclusion component associated to this model since the majority of students came from socially vulnerable contexts.
