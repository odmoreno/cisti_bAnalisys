An Ontology for Describing Competency-Based Curriculum at Engineering Careers
ABSTRACT
Nowadays universities need to define the curriculums and subjects of their careers using the concept of professional competencies. This implies properly identifying the knowledge, skills and aptitudes that a professional need to practise, and with it, the curricular activities that will allow him to achieve it. The definition of based-competency curriculums it is a new paradigm that requires changes in the way of teaching. In this work the authors propose an ontology that conceptualizes the idea of competencies in the formulation of the curriculum of subjects, focused on university engineering careers. This ontology is part of an ontology network developed previously by the authors. The idea is to take a step forward in the definition of e-learning semantic tools that give support to teacher in the formulation of the competencies and the selection of teaching material and assessment tools, establishing relationships between all of them to achieve the objectives. In this way, this work provides a conceptual framework that facilitates the definition of competency-based curriculums and allows relating it with the teaching and assessment methodologies to achieve the defined competencies.
