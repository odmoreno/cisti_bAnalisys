The role of high-tech manufacturing in Ecuadorâ€™s economic growth
ABSTRACT
The economic structure of countries is linked to the changes and the importance of economic sectors over time, considering their contribution to total production. In this scenario, manufacturing activities show economies of scale and increasing returns. The objective of this paper is to explain the role of manufacturing activities and in particular high-tech manufacturing in economic growth under a kaldorian framework. In this context, it is important to conceive whether there has been a change in the structure of this sector, highlighting the output per worker in high-tech manufacturing in 24 provinces of Ecuador during the period 2012-2020.
