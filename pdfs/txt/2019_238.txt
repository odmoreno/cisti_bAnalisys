ABSTRACT
Web development has now become a technological tool that has driven the evolution of the Internet, it has positioned itself as a vital source of employment generation. This project presents the development of a web portal that allows managing reserves of the synthetic soccer field of the Technical University of Loja in Ecuador, which will streamline and automate all processes that are currently done manually, thus improving control and services, also minimizing the time needed to verify the availability of the court. To carry out this development the following tools have been used: PHP 5, MySQL database system 6.3 and HTML, these are based on the two-layer architecture (Client - Server). The system will allow the optimization of the current reservation process, in which students and staff of the university can make reservations from anywhere at any time.
