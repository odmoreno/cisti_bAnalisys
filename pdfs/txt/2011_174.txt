Math4Kids
ABSTRACT
Using the notion that children learn by interacting with the surrounding world and by playing, the project sets an innovative approach and environment to provide mathematical concepts to children in the ages from 5 to 7 through interaction with a computer game. Notions such as numbers, weight, dynamics, gravity, collision, geometry, adding, sets and groups are used in a fun problem-solving oriented approach, promoting and stimulating the acquisition and learning process of the basics of Mathematics, the game being used as an auxiliary tool in pre-school classes.
