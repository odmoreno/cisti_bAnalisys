Socio-constructivist teaching powered by ICT in the STEM areas for primary school
ABSTRACT
This paper aims to demonstrate the potential of using the socio-constructivism approach and Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) to engage elementary school children in STEM learning. This study is based on a group of elementary school children, who have had the opportunity to learn scientific concepts through the use of prototypes, the construction of games including the themes in question and the inclusion of ITC. Data analysis, after participant observation and semi-structured interviews, leads to the conclusion that this is an efficient method to engage children in STEM-based learning activities.
