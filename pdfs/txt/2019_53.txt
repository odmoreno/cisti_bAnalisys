Guard@Lis: A new Augmented Reality Mobile Application for Birdwatching
ABSTRACT
The development of this work is aimed at the creation of a birdwatching application, with the purpose of helping to find and identify bird species and encourage the preservation of the habitat and of these species. In order to create a different system of bird observation, augmented reality techniques are used, allowing to present 3D representations referring to the models of some of these birds. The application will work by creating routes along the city of Leiria, having specific points along the route, defined for the observation of certain species. The whole development process of this application was thought as a didactic guide that allows users to be able to identify many different bird species, while allowing the user to show some of the main historical and tourist hotspots of Leiria.
