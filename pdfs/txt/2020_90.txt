Open IoT technologies in the classroom — a case study on the student’s perception
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) has been perceived by several authors as a technology with a potential impact in educational contexts, highlighting the concept of hypersituation and its didactic potential. This paper presents the main results relating the student’s perception about an IoT based learning environment supported on an IoT device and a set of didactic guides. The IoT device was developed with low cost and open technology. Complementarily to the device development, a visual guidebook was created to facilitate the device construction by teachers and students, even if they do not have prior knowledge about the use of IoT technologies. Along with the device assembly guide, interdisciplinary didactic guides were also developed to be used in learning tasks. The results obtained demonstrate that teens involved in the study expressed a desire to continue to use the device in their classes and that it was a stimulating and facilitating factor for learning.
