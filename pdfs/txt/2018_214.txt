An indoor navigation architecture using variable data sources for blind and visually impaired persons
ABSTRACT
Contrary to outdoor positioning and navigation systems, there isn't a counterpart global solution for indoor environments. Usually, the deployment of an indoor positioning system must be adapted case by case, according to the infrastructure and the objective of the localization. A particularly delicate case is related with persons who are blind or visually impaired. A robust and easy to use indoor navigation solution would be extremely useful, but this would also be particularly difficult to develop, given the special requirements of the system that would have to be more accurate and user friendly than a general solution. This paper presents a contribute to this subject, by proposing a hybrid indoor positioning system adaptable to the surrounding indoor structure, and dealing with different types of signals to increase accuracy. This would permit lower the deployment costs, since it could be done gradually, beginning with the likely existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to get a fairy accuracy up to a high accuracy using visual tags and NFC tags when necessary and possible.
