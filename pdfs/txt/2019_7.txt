Method F2A2P - Flow of Architecture and Assistance for Programs and Projects Monitoring by RPC - Reunions of Point of Control
ABSTRACT
The known Methodologies of Project Management, such as, PMBoK®, PRINCE2® and ZOPP (in the text referenced) drive the planning, the construction and the monitoring of Projects, with the basis on the compilation of Best Practices in this subject. However, these do not describe in detail which tools should be applied to the success of the actions. Admittedly, the use of meetings that aim to administrate and to control the phases of continuous processes of work, is an effective way of managing the progress of activities. Therefore, in order to perform this management procedure related to the progress of the Project Phases (model of organization common to all Methodologies), this article presents the Method F2A2P - Flow of Architecture and Assistance for Programs and Projects. This Method is based on the conducting of RPC - Reunions of Point of Control, conducted in a structured manner, with the objective of maintaining a precise administration of the development of a Project.
