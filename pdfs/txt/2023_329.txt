Waste Collection Management in Almada and Seixal: Acceptance of IoT Technology
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, in the era of technological revolution, and due to the growing trend of population agglomerations, many challenges emerge that must be answered to adapt to this new reality. Therefore, the management of large cities has become a complex and demanding mission for public managers of these cities, where ensuring the quality of life of people is increasingly challenging. To meet this major challenge in the management of cities, smart cities have emerged, i.e., cities with the use of technology, namely IoT, which assist in the management of cities to make them more efficient and effective. Before the implementation of this technology in a city, it is essential to understand how people will accept it to ensure that the change project will be more effective. This work intends to know the level of acceptance of IoT in the management of waste collection in Almada and Seixal, with this objective, questionnaires were carried out to the population of the two municipalities to assess their level of acceptance of IoT in the management of waste collection.
