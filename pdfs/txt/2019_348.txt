Accessible educational materials: Marrakesh Treaty and the right of integrity of works
ABSTRACT
The issue of the integrity of works has been treated in a very vague way in Article 2 Lit B of the Marrakesh Treaty, it only indicates that the adaptation must be made “taking due consideration of the changes needed to make the work accessible.” From the practice of creating accessible materials, the question arises about the possibility of generating accessible copies of fragments of works or single articles. In this paper we propose to analyze the scope of the obligation of respecting the integrity of the works in relation to the partial copy or partial adaptation, under the assumption that this possibility often determines the viability of projects for the creation of accessible materials on demand.
