Ã‘awinchay: low cost system for facilitating the Braille literacy for blind people
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the design and implementation of low cost system for facilitating the Braille Literacy for blind people, it was aimed for teachers and students in schools in Apurimac Peru. This first ongoing prototype was developed using the Java programming language, two Arduino microcontroller, 12 servomotors, 12 LEDs and connection cables. The teacher types a word in the input form, then select the time delay, then the system sends each letter signal to the Arduino hardware and then it sends to the servomotor the signal to lift the LEDs, finally the blind student touches the lifted LEDs to interpret the character, syllable or word. The cost of the hardware used is USD$ 40 approximately. The prototype was tested by teachers and blind students, teachers manifest their conformity with the system functionality, because it is more intuitive and easier to use compared with traditional paper and awl based system, and blind students can learn Braille literacy in less time than before.
