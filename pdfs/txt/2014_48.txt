MAnGve maturity model (M3): A proposal for a doctoral thesis
ABSTRACT
Context: Agile Governance has been suggested as an innovative approach based on the use of the principles and values of the manifesto for agile software development on traditional Governance. However, the evaluation of this maturity is presented as a challenge today. Objective: This article describes a proposal of a model for the evaluation of maturity according to the meta principles of Agile Governance. Method: The model has been constructed through a qualitative approach, using the inductive method with comparative and structuralist procedures supported by exploratory studies and a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for Agile Governance. Results: As partial results, a preliminary version of the architecture of the model and its components was constructed. Conclusion: The model has been structured by key references and better practices identified for Agile Governance during this research. Finally, the model has been evolved through discussions with the scientific and industrial community and will soon be submitted to a survey and multiple case studies.
