Online transparency assessment: The case of Directorate-Generals and SIADAP
ABSTRACT
The goal of this paper is to analyze the online availability of Portuguese Directorate-Generals (DG) assessment related information, and determine whether the existing favorable conditions to such disclosure are, nevertheless, sufficient. The DG assessment process is framed by the SIADAP 1 (public services assessment) legislation which includes mandatory information disclosure requirements, and the existence of a dedicated portal (GeADAP) to collect and disclose assessment data. This study included the analysis of DG web sites and the GeADAP portal in search of information concerning the years 2008 and 2013 and two important moments of the assessment process: the beginning (establishing the assessment instrument â€” setting objectives) and the end (assessment results) of the process. In general, it was found that less than expected information is available considering the legal obligations, the existence of a dedicated portal, and the general Open Government principles adopted worldwide. Such results may be a consequence of the lack of information disclosure monitoring and public officials' accountability procedures.
