Systematic review of software product certification
ABSTRACT
Software quality is becoming in recent years a great importance because of the growing need to ensure proper operation of computer systems, which are increasingly present in most areas of our lives. This focus on quality has been focused primarily on the processes used for software development, emerging standards such as CMMI certifications under or ISO / IEC 15504. However, each day the concern for the quality of software product itself and not only by the processes used for development is greater. Thus, standards have emerged as the ISO / IEC 25000, which define a quality model and an evaluation process for the product. However, certifications that take as their object the software product itself and ensure compliance of the product of a set of requirements, are less widespread. In this sense, the present systematic review aims to identify existing initiatives related to the certification of software products, the features they have and the state of maturity in their application.
