Success Prediction of Leads â€“ A Machine Learning Approach
ABSTRACT
Competition between organizations urges the need of using new approaches. A lead is described by an individual or organization with interest in the products or services that an entity sells, and Machine Learning appears to be a very effective way of improving the performance of the corporate leads. Predicting the success of new leads is a critical aspect to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing, and to tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a solution supported in the Machine Learning approach. This solution was implemented to increase the winning probability of proposals. Preliminary results also suggest that by using this solution, managers could improve the quality of business decisions.
