Protocolar extension for reliable communications in IoT environments
ABSTRACT
The current developments in the Information Technology area, and particularly in Computer Networks related fields, have sustained a considerable scientific and technological progress of the area usually denominated as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, this article focuses on the design, implementation and test of a communication protocol extension oriented to IoT environments. The proposed solution is designed to provide reliable multi-hop communication capabilities for commonly used and open platform IoT devices (e.g. Arduino). The implemented API provides a modular set of service primitives that will allow the successful development of IoT applications with differentiated reliability and coverage requirements.
