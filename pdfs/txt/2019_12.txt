Design of information system architecture for the recommendation of tourist sites in the city of Manta, Ecuador through a Chatbot
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the development of computer systems for service recommendations is becoming increasingly common. On Internet, users can find from recommended web sites that appear as advertising, to virtual assistants that interact with the people through -per example- a chat. The current paper will present a solution for the recommendation of tourist places of the city of Manta, Ecuador. These recommendations will be performed through the decision trees algorithm and will have a chatbot as user interface in Facebook Messenger. The presented solution integrates different components, and this paper will describe the proposal by means of diagrams of software architecture. Within these components, the integration of Web services such as IBM Watson Assistant and Google Dialogflow will be presented.
