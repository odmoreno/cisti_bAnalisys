Math exercise generation and smart assessment
ABSTRACT
In this paper we concentrate on the field of mathematics education where the aim is to generate exercises going beyond those with answers of simple types (e.g. multiple-choice, Boolean, integer, or file comparison). We present three examples from introductory college mathematics and emphasize the key points that should be taken into account in order to develop a “well-posed” exercise together with its verification. All the presented examples were implemented in the system PASSAROLA.
