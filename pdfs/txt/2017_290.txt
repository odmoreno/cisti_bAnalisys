TRADUZ: Proposal of an interactive translator for people with hearing special needs
ABSTRACT
This work proposes the construction of a tool for communication between listeners and speakers through the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) and the French Sign Language (LFS), making a simultaneous translation between the Brazilian written language and the French written language integrated through a web application, with the aid of the recognition of signals by techniques of image recognition and use of webservices. In addition, it raises a bibliography of the struggle of disabled people, the importance of non-verbal communication in human life, as well as an analysis of several translators available in the electronic mean, raising their strengths and weaknesses by comparing them in standard color, structure and navigation used. At the end of the study, a general evaluation is carried out on the application of a questionnaire to the users and a case study with TRADUZ.
