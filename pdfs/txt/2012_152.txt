Professional e-Competence in Europe: European research
ABSTRACT
The CEPIS Professional e-Competence is the first European research to produce and assess an up-to-date picture of the actual e-competences of IT professionals across Europe today, using profiles recognised by the labour market and analysing them based on the European e-Competence Framework. The research identified the e-competences of approximately 2000 IT professionals from 28 countries across Europe. It was undertaken by CEPIS, the Council of European Professionalism Informatics Societies, and the national informatics associations that are its members. This paper focuses on the European research findings with a special emphasis on the gathered results for Spain.
