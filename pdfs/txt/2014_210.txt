With advances in communication technology, future internet presents numerous opportunities to develop new systems designed to make day to day life easier and to enhance and prolong the life of people with disabilities. This motivation propels the development of new services that integrate the mobility of cloud systems and the diversity of IoT (Internet of Things). It will enable us to create new and more independent care systems for people with disabilities, enabling a certain degree of independence. This can have a psychological and social impact due to the better quality of life that enables. Other motivation is the versatility and mobility of services it can provide, making those services available. In this paper is explored and explained the different kinds of technologies that can be integrated to enable creation of future internet platforms. Also, an IoT Cloud platform will be analyzed and some tests will be made, ending with some conclusions and lessons learned in this work.
