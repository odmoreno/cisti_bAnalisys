Bioengineering learning models to explain nonlinarearity and chaos
ABSTRACT
The XXI century companies are increasingly interested on in the development of complex processes on bioengineering and health sciences. In this context, it is essential for undergraduate and graduate students to understand the behavior of complex phenomena. However, nowadays, academic programs are limited to the study of linear systems and first-order approximations; while companies use sophisticated software applications applied to complex systems, whose results have to be interpreted. In order to bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a learning methodology based on working with simulation programs of non-linear dynamical systems and chaos to treat complexity, applied to bioengineering. In particular, in this work we make a software application to analyzing three interesting studies in the context of biological systems: a nonlinear electrical oscillator that is a paradigm of self-sustained oscillations, a heartbeat model based on this oscillator, and the Brusselator system to model autocatalytic biochemical reactions. As a result, we are proving how it is possible, with this application, to analyze the complex behavior and the anomalies in biological systems with this methodology. By means of the proposed software applications in this paper, we analyze and facilitate the learning involving models closer to the real world.
