USS: User support system
ABSTRACT
Advances in usability and design techniques (e.g. user-centered design) try to facilitate the use of interactive systems. However, users still have to adapt to interactive systems, i.e. they have to learn the steps required to accomplish a task either by trial and error or by obtaining help. While advanced users are usually able to adapt without much effort this is far from being the case with beginners. Some interactive systems offer different interaction styles in an attempt to meet the needs of all types of user but this is not the case with all interactive systems. In this paper we present the USS framework, which aims to be the basis for the adaptation of interactive systems to user needs through task automation. The work is illustrated by means of a case study.
