Non-invasive monitoring environment: Toward solutions for assessing postures at work
ABSTRACT
This research work presents the Non-Invasive Monitoring Environment, to analyze the body postures of a person during daily work activities, through the use of sensors. Ergonomic assessment is a strong eHealth study to measure the risk of incorrect postures at work. The visual information of the evaluation in real time allows identifying the exact points and the time of the activity that the evaluated person presented with some risk for its quantification with some approved evaluation method. The monitoring or evaluation should not interrupt the person in their activity, much less bother with sensors in the body, which prevents the analysis of postures at work. The study of the sensors in evaluation of the postures at work, seeks to spread the understanding on the ergonomic impact and the feedback towards the person, as a solution of eHealth software.
