MongoDB: Analysis of Performance with Data from the National High School Exam (Enem)
ABSTRACT
It is increasingly common for public and private organizations to deal with the challenges of data management in Big Data environments, tipycally characterized by high volume, great variety, fast generation velocity, in addition to intrinsic issues of data veracity and value. This context gave rise to NoSQL database technologies, with MongoDB as one of its prominent representatives. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of MongoDB in its cluster architecture against the standalone mode, with massive data from the National High School Exam (Enem), in addition to performing a brief interpretation of the results from the perspective of the educational domain. The initial results of query, update, and delete operations demonstrate a set of advantages and disadvantages of the experiments' architectures. The Information Technology (IT) professional's role in defining the scope of the database project for a more bold choice of the NoSQL architecture is highlighted in a cost-benefit perspective for organizations.
