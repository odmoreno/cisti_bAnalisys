New techonologies towards cognitive stimulation in elderly with dementia: Effects and potential
ABSTRACT
Dementia is currently one of the main diseases associated with aging, with serious and significant functional limitations for the elderly. Given its increasing incidence [1], intervention in the field of dementia has been guided by the development of cognitive stimulation strategies and programs, which seek to minimize its adverse effects and simultaneously optimize elderly overall functionality [2] [3] [4]. These programs are new fields of knowledge and intervention, in more recent cases supported by new technologies that, due to their sensitivity, efficiency and accessibility, prove effective in terms of intervention in cognitive impairment. Indeed, several programs, using new technologies, have demonstrated their usefulness and positive outcomes for elderly with dementia. The aim of this paper is to present an empirical approach review of the effects of cognitive stimulation using new technologies in elderly patients with dementia. The conclusion emphasizes that intervention produces successful results in the stabilization and improvement of cognitive losses, presenting new technologies as important alternatives to the more conventional ways of dealing with this disease.
