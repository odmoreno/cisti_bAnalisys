Using of an anonymous communication in e-government services: In the prevention of passive attacks on a network
ABSTRACT
Nowadays citizens live in a world where communication technologies offer opportunities for new interactions between people and society. Clearly, e-government is changing the way citizens relate to their government, moving the interaction of physical environment and management towards digital participation. Therefore, it is necessary for e-government to have procedures in place to prevent and lessen the negative impact of an attack or intrusion by third parties. In this research work, he focuses on the implementation of anonymous communication in a proof of concept application called “Delta”, whose function is to allow auctions and offers of products, thus marking the basis for future implementations in e-government services.
