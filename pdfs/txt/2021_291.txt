Impact of information and communication technologies in Higher Education Institutions in times of COVID-19 : A look from collaborative work and study modality
ABSTRACT
Higher education institutions, like other organizations worldwide, have had to adapt their educational model to the pandemic situation, as a human and at the same time forced response, to maintain their educational offer and their enrollment income. Under this context, the research objective of this article focuses in determining the perception of university students in relation to collaborative work through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). The methodology used is descriptive with the application of statistical tools that allow, on the one hand, to determine the validity of the dimensions evaluated and, on the other, to obtain a description of the university feeling. The main findings focus on confirming the validity of the ACOES questionnaire and the relevance of its structure, as well as ratifying the role of collaborative work as an active methodology in Higher Education that invites university professors to be more flexible and innovative constantly, since regardless of the study modality, personal interaction or ICT-mediated, constitutes the cornerstone of a relevant teaching-learning process.
