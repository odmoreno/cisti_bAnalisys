Application of a hybrid process software requirements management
ABSTRACT
Software requirements management is essential to achieve expected levels of productivity and quality in software development. This paper proposes to apply this process a governamental institution, by proposing a standardized methodology of requirements management, adapted to the needs of the institution, to improve productivity and quality. Therefore we analysed the traditional method of software-development, with emphasis on the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and agile methods such as Scaled Agile Framework process (SAFe), in order to propose a hybrid method for requirements management. Interviews, technical applications to establish the context, literature searches on documents, standards and best practices were held in order to validate the hybrid approach of the proposed methodology that was applied to a case study.
