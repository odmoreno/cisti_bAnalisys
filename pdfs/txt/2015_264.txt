Distributed flight simulation environment using flight simulator X
ABSTRACT
The crescent diversity and heterogeneity of vehicles increases the importance of simulation platforms that can reproduce missions using several kinds of vehicles. A platform is being developed at LIACC for this purpose, using Microsoft Flight Simulator X as the simulation engine. Because this simulator has some constraints involving its active simulation area around the player's central aircraft, a strategy needed to be created to deal with the problem. A proof of concept was implemented, using two different instances of the simulator and moving the aircraft seamlessly from one simulator to another, thus augmenting the available simulation area and distributing the simulation workload by several network-connected machines.
