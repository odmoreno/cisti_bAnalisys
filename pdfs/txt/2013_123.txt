Statistical analysis of the implementation for best practices in software development organizations
ABSTRACT
The software industry is formed by 90% of small and medium organizations formally reported to government agencies. The needs of such organizations worldwide are particular and are far from the needs of large organizations. Large organizations are capable of supporting and implementing large and complex structures of international standards and models for software process improvement. The provision of facilities to small and medium sized organizations to implement best practices in software development based on the recommendations of the international standards and models is: a) a need for these organizations, b) a duty of both industry and academia. Therefore, it is necessary to make a diagnosis to identify the needs of these organizations in the area of best practices in software development. The goal of this paper is to analyze the current state of the implementation of best practices in software development in small and medium organizations. To achieve this goal, a survey was designed. Then it was applied to a representative region of Colombia (Medell√≠n). In this paper we present the analysis of the collected statistical results, allowing a pilot study given the target population (Latin America).
