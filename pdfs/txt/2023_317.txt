Female decline in the technology sector
ABSTRACT
Despite the numbers of gender gap in many engineering domains is being closer to equality, in Information Technologies gender gap is still high and there it is not expected to be solved if there wonâ€™t be relevant activities to promote women presence in this sector. In this article, we intend to analyse the available data concerning the weak presence of the female gender in the technology sector. In what concerns the methodology used to develop this article, we resorted to reports and articles in order to understand why currently there is a gender discrepancy in the technology area. Throughout this article we will analyse several topics such as the impact of COVID-19 in the participation of women in the labour market in general and, in particular, in Technology companies, the challenges faced by the female gender nowadays and the importance of women in the role of leader. It was possible to conclude that there are several initiatives to promote the gender gap mitigation in STEM and in Technology. However, women are still underrepresented in all functions and specially in leadership.
