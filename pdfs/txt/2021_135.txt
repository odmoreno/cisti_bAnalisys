State-of-art for Accessibility Measurement in Electronic Government Services for People with Visual Disabilities
ABSTRACT
The digital transformation of public administration has among its various dimensions, the development of digital services based on information and communication technologies (ICT) that allow state institutions to bring citizens closer together, thus reducing the digital divide. For such purposes, and for vulnerable populations to be covered, it is necessary to guarantee minimum accessibility characteristics in electronic government services aimed at people with reduced visual abilities. In this study, the systematic review of the state of the art on models for measuring the level of accessibility in digital government services is developed, specifically in the aspects that correspond to facilitating the use of them by people with visual disabilities.
