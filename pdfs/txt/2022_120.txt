An overview of the Information Systems in Primary Care of the Brazil's Unified Health System
ABSTRACT
The Unified Health System (SUS) was established in Brazil by the Federal Constitution of 1988 to meet the constitutional mandate that classifies health as a right for all and a duty of the State. When considering that Brazil has more than 210 million people, it is noted that the SUS, with a annual budget (2022) of US$ 31B is the largest public and free health system in the world. To manage all care provided by SUS in health centers and posts, hospitals, laboratories, and blood centers, including; and the Health Surveillance, Epidemiological Surveillance, Environmental Surveillance services, in addition to foundations and academic and scientific research institutes, the Ministry of Health (MS) makes use of more than 300 technological platforms. However, despite the existence of all these systems, there is still no characterization of this platforms from the perspective of computational architecture of Health Information Systems (HIS). Thus, this article presents the main aspects of the SIS and the computational characteristics of the ICT systems which support the management of Primary Health Care in the SUS.
