ABSTRACT
This paper analyses the experience of NÃºcleo de Cidadania Digital (NCD) regarding the impact of the use of games in the teaching of ICT for the elderly in the promotion of social and digital inclusion of this public, showing the process to choose, how to use and the perceived results by the teachers of the use of games. The need of the use of games to include elderly people was perceived by the lack of interest by the student in the practice of the mouse and keyboard techniques, mainly. It was selected simple, intuitives and challenging games to make the practice of the taught skills most pleasant possible. Also was used the gamification concept in the evaluation turning into a more gradual process by observation of the abilities development. With the use of the games the practice became less burdening and more attractive, having more acceptance by the student. This was easily perceived when the student start to arrive earlier to class only to play the presented games.
