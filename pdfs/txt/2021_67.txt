The influence of Augmented Reality in the teaching and learning process in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in general and Augmented Reality (AR) have a major impact on the teaching and learning process of pupils. The AR is still little known and exploited in an educational context in Portugal, and for this reason a qualitative study has been chosen on: "The Augmented Reality as the enabler of learning in the 1st Cycle of Basic Education". The study was carried out in a group of 21 students from the second year of schooling in the methodology of Distance Learning (E@D). This study has allowed us to reflet that the integration of AR into the teaching and learning process allows pupils to increase their motivation for learning through a more motivating approach. The RA can be a learning tool, and it is a valid support for the teacher in the monopolization of pedagogical activities. The results obtained, after analyzing and processing the data, have enabled us to verify that the AR can be a enabler of learning, in that it promotes new learning contexts, more innovative and motivating for today's students. The study concluded that ICT and AR integrated into an educational environment can create a more stimulating and interactive environment by promoting richer and more meaningful learning for pupils, given their involvement in the various activities proposed to them.
