Smartphone robot for high school students: RobHiSS
ABSTRACT
This project arose from the absence in the market of a modular smartphone controlled robot capable of encouraging high school students to program and apply the physics and math's knowledge learned into it. Therefore this project's intention was to study the best way to develop a do-it-yourself (DIY) cost effective robot using only components off the shelf (COTS) and benefit from the omnipresence of smartphones. With the objective of making this robot attractive to anyone with low programming skills, it was important to make it configurable in an easy to understand language and a simple user interface, like the ones provided by Scratch and the MIT AppInventor2. The functional, physical and non-functional requirements for this robot and the free software developed are presented and validated attesting that this project was successfully completed.
