Implementation of medical algorithms in the Breast Pathology module of VCIntegrator
ABSTRACT
In order to provide better health care, attending the physicians can use come tools in clinical decision making called medical algorithms. The medical algorithms used in this work are part of The Medical Algorithms Project. The VCIntegrator is an integrated platform of electronic virtual patient records, which allows installation of clinical modules from various specialties. The aim of this work is to select and implement medical algorithms in a medical record for Breast Pathology. It was made a questionnaire to the physicians of Breast Pathology Unit of the Hospital de S. Jo√£o, of which were selected three algorithms to be implemented in the VCIntegrator. The implementation of these medical algorithms in the VCIntegrator, aimed at improving the quality of health care to the patient, because they help health professionals in decision making.
