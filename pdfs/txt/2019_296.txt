Social network sites and elders: An empirical study
ABSTRACT
This study analyzes the adoption of social networks by the elderly. This age group decreases its participation in social activities due to the deterioration in its physical capacities, isolating it from the rest of the world. The use of social networks helps to keep the person connected reducing their feeling of loneliness, which contributes to improving their quality of life. Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), this research studies the impact of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use in the use of social networks and analyzes the audacity and technological anxiety of the elderly as external antecedents of the model. All the hypotheses are validated and the use of socialnetworks by the older adult in Chile is explained by 38%.
