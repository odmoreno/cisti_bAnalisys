Learning outcomes Interoperability: A case study
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, we talk about the information society and knowledge, globalization, innovation, and, more particularly, skills, learning outcomes and the Bologna Process. These areas of knowledge are interconnected and large changes have happened very quickly. The aim of this work consists in the presentation of an identification model and skills' classification and learning outcomes, based on the official documents of the course units (syllabus and assessment components) of a course of Higher Education. The result of applying this model, available in the Semantic Web, will contribute to interoperability learning outcomes, thus enhancing the mobility of teachers and students in the EHEA (European Higher Education Area) and third countries.
