The new generation of mobile networks: 5G technology and its application in the e-education context
ABSTRACT
The development of mobile telecommunications has shown important changes in recent years, from 3G, 4G to 5G, making technological growth evident. This article presents the characteristics of 5G technology, and possible applications within the educational context and its application in the training of Software Engineers. The new generation of mobile networks makes it possible to improve the quality of education, based on the access and use of greater tools that help enrich and transform education. Currently education in the field of Software Engineering has its core in the creation of quality software, promoting the modernization of learning processes and favoring the current needs that arise in society, this creation leads to the use of a connection with high transmission speeds, low latency and delay, thus becoming true tools that can be used by the community.
