ABSTRACT
This article shows the tourist potentialities in the Southern Amazon of Ecuador inside the Zamora Chinchipe province through methodological applications with the participation of local actors, to identify natural and cultural attractions susceptible of becoming tourist products. The results show the feasibility of the implementation of ecotourism routes based on the inventory of identified and hierarchical attractions, of which twenty-two natural and thirteen cultural were registered. As an added value, the results imply the identification of two new ecotourism routes that diversify the tourist offer of the area, as well as the presentation of strategies used for the promotion and tourist diffusion of the routes through social networks and web applications developed with the principles of the agile methodologies of software development.
