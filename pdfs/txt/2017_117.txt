Lesson learned management model for solving incidents
ABSTRACT
This paper is focused on explaining the results of a research project that outlined a management model of lessons learned for solving incidents in a company, which started with the identification of the problem, pointed out the disadvantages currently faced by organizations to give solution to the incidences. It was based on a conceptual framework that gives a preliminary description of some of the most commonly used incident management tools in organizations and approaches the application of knowledge management, lessons learned and incident resolution participants. Lessons learned are a very important factor for companies in managing knowledge and analyzing what has been generated, over time these lessons learned become an asset that makes companies more productive leading to best practices and quality improvement. In the development of this model, we investigated the models of existing lessons learned, resulting in a problem-oriented lessons learned model based on the best practices of ISO9001 and ITIL [1], [2] and knowledge management.
