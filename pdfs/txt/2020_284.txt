SENSE: Sensory component VR application for hearing impaired people to enhance the music experience
ABSTRACT
The percentage representing the hearing-impaired population worldwide is 5%, representing 360 million inhabitants. When carrying out an analysis of related works, it was observed that there are few applications in the market focused on improving certain aspects of the day-to-day life of this sector of the population. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop an application that allows the representation of music in a perceptible way for people who lack hearing, through the use of sensory stimuli that are incorporated with vibration motors and at the same time visual stimuli with virtual reality. As results of the proposed application it was observed that the motivation of the users improved in terms of experiencing sensory perceptions that go according to the musical rhythm, obtaining a 93.3% of acceptance.
