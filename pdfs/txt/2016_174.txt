Strategy to support the software inspection in distributed development environments
ABSTRACT
Software development should be alert to the time set for implementation, the costs involved and the level of quality that is sought for the software product. Software defect is in one of the factors that most influence the successful development of a software project, both in traditional designs, co-located, as in the design of distributed software development (DDS). One way to find defects in the early stages of development is to use the software inspection, however the inspection in a distributed development environment software becomes even more complex due to the inherent characteristics of the DDS, as geographical distance, time differencezones and cultural differences. This article presents a strategy to support the inspection of software distributed software development, thus tries to minimize the impacts of DDS inspection. Among the many existing business models when considering DDS was used as an example of implementing the proposed strategy offshore insourcing model.
