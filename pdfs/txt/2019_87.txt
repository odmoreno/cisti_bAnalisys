The Maturity and Efficiency of IT Governance Processes Based on Cobit 5: A Case of a Health Sector Organization in Portugal
ABSTRACT
IT governance is a theme that has been in every day's business. Organizations are more interested in this area because they are concerned with value creation for their stakeholders and meeting their needs. IT governance is supported by a number of frameworks that help organizations reach their goals. The objective of this topic was based on a study to understand in detail the project of adoption of the Cobit 5 in an organization of the health sector in Portugal. The company chosen for the case study is SPMS (Shared Services of the Ministry of Health). This project aims to adopt Cobit 5 for issues of governance and management of Health Systems in order to promote continuous improvement in the health information ecosystem (eSIS) in which a set of initiatives are being implemented and risk management and information security are the most critical areas of this project and constitute the main area under analysis of this study.
