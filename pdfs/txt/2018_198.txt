Augmented reality “Another level of education”
ABSTRACT
Secondary Education is one of the bases for academic excellence, despite this there are certain difficulties in understanding textbooks based on their content and the low motivation of reading. However, we have a technology, which is the Augmented Reality, which has gradually developed within the field of education, revolutionizing new teaching methods along with their learning processes, facilitating an understanding of complex factors in education, through a graphic representation of images based on real world information. In this work we link the Augmented Reality within the knowledge environment in Secondary Education, and its influence on academic performance, showing how the manipulation of virtual objects is done as if it were a real one.
