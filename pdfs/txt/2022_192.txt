"I use, therefore Iâ€™m healthy" : Assessment of the accessibility for the SNS 24 for the elderly
ABSTRACT
We live in an increasingly aging society and where the percentage of elderly people has been increasing over the last few years. Today's society is increasingly mediated by technology, which poses more demanding challenges to the elderly population that has low digital literacy. This is an age group that suffers from some inequalities, and access to digital technologies is still a reality that does not apply to the generality of this group. This article aims to analyze some concepts and relate them, aiming to understand the accessibility of the SNS 24 application to the target audience of the elderly, based on the analysis of data collected from a small sample of citizens aged 65 and over, through interviews carried out. to 5 elderly people, this being an exploratory study, which had the pandemic confinement as constraints. In this way, it was possible to verify that the SNS 24 application can be extremely important for the daily life of the elderly, allowing greater autonomy and empowerment, through the approximation to health services. However, for this application to be inclusive and suitable for all age groups, it is necessary to carry out some reformulations, taking into account the needs that were raised with this study, namely with regard to the registration and size of the letters/fonts of the application.
