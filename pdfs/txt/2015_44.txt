Educational data mining to track students performance on teaching learning environment LabSQL
ABSTRACT
Educational environments have added the software use to support teaching activities. In distance learning courses it's common to store large amounts of data, which detail record the activities developed by the students. Those data can be used by professionals for the discovery of informations that can help teachers and students to manage and monitor the teaching-learning process. This work aims to obtain inferences related to the performance of the students, based on the data obtained from the learning enviroment, called Language Teaching Laboratory SQL(LabSQL), through the use of Educational Data Mining techniques (MDE). From the experiments done, we propose an architecture model for an interface based on educationals mining data in order to help students and teachers during the course of the discipline.
