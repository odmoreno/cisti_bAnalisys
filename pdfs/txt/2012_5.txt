The interconnection of DSS and online social networking
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the outcomes of a literature review on the interconnection of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and online social networking. Although a large number of research papers postulate, in one way or another, that Decision Support Systems and online social networking are interconnected, only a small amount of them actually elaborates on such connection. Therefore, we underwent a large bibliographic review, based on four major bibliographic indexing resources to reveal the actual interconnection of DSS and online social networking.
