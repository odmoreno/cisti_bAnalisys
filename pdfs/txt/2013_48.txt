Tool to assess the maturity level of the risk management of a software development process
ABSTRACT
The risk management process comprises a set of coordinated activities to identify, analyze, assess, treat, monitor and communicate project risks. Organizations that wish to implement these set of activities on their software development process, in its turn, should adhere a series of activities in compliance to existing standards and regulations. However, there are not found references for models that evaluate this process through a diagnostic assessment tool, allowing managers to have a clear view of its deficiencies. In this way, this study aims to present the diagnostic assessment tool that is based on the GAIA Risks framework as well as the methodology for calculate and display of results.
