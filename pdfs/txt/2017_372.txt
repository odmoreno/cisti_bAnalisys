An initial approach to e-government acceptance and use: A literature analysis of e-Government acceptance determinants
ABSTRACT
Information technology has become one of the core elements of electronic government (e-Government) and should figure prominently in future governance. E-Government services, through electronic means, should provide a more cost-effective and convenient way for citizens to interact with government, however their adoption is still far from a satisfactory level. The study herein has examined research on the adoption of e-Government services. Using data obtained from previous research, this article identifies the variables that contribute to the adoption of e-Government by citizens and the model created is presented. Overall, this study concludes that e-Government has been adopted by many governments, but it is still at an early stage, and there are still barriers to its more widespread adoption in society.
