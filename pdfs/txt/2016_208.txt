GeoSpatial platform for port management processes
ABSTRACT
Port authorities have the need to manage diverse information within the port area under its responsibility regarding their land and sea infrastructures. Through this innovation, which adds value to the port and its activity, it is made an interconnection of strategic areas, with the provision and sharing of structured data in a georeferenced environment. This work presents an innovative platform, based on various modules and allows effective control and efficient management of operations, processes and requirements associated with any sea port. The developed modules are designed to support the activities of business processes in the following areas of the port administration: Heritage, Hydrography, Port Traffic, Dominial, Studies and Works, Safety and Environment. Most of these modules were pioneers in the integration with business process management of Portuguese ports of Leix√µes and Viana do Castelo.
