Understanding Student Needs around Academic Enrollment: Insights from a Co-design Study
ABSTRACT
We present the insights of a co-design process of an enrollment support tool for undergraduate students. Our goal was to design an effective tool that would streamline the enrollment process and address common challenges faced by students. Undergraduate students were involved in a 4-month co-design process, providing different types of feedback on the toolâ€™s design and functionality at different stages of the design process. Our observations indicate that the co-design process led to a tool that would better meet the needs and preferences of undergraduate students, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly enrollment process. This study highlights the benefits of involving users in the design process and provides insight into how co-creation can be used to improve the effectiveness of technologies for educational settings.
