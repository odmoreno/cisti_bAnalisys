Creating value in equity crowdfunding platforms using blockchain technology
ABSTRACT
Crowdfunding platforms are increasingly used as a means of attracting investment, donations or loans to finance projects, companies, organizations and causes. In equity crowdfunding, the investor acquires a stake in a company or project and is remunerated according to its success. This article aims to demonstrate how Distribuited Ledger Technology (Blockchain) can help mitigate some of the problems associated with equity crowdfunding platforms or even add features and capabilities, making them more appealing to fundraisers and investors. Through the design and modeling of an equity crowdfunding platform that uses a deconcentrated ledger to record the transactions that took place there, with the capacity to load and execute smart contracts, it was possible to verify that blockchain technology can create value in this type of platform, being able to mitigate or even solve some of the problems associated with this type of crowdfunding.
