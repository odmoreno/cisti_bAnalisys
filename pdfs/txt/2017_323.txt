A QFD based model integration in Agile software development
ABSTRACT
The actual development of the IT sector generated software products that are now a significant part of any field. The increasing number of IT products led to changes in the project management of software development. If, in the beginnings, the project management tools were limited and included approaches such as: the waterfall model, the incremental spiral model, prototyping, and rapid application development, but as of lately, the quality management specific tools found a place amongst the new tools used. The proposed model uses the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) as tool in software development, which offers an accurate picture of the current state of the degree to which software meets customer requirements by calculating an offset. In developing the model we took into account the principles of Agile and the concepts introduced by Scrum, in order to integrate the proposed instrument in a widely used methodology that connects the steps between idea and market.
