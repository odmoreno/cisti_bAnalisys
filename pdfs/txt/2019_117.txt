Social Interactions Between Non-Profit Organization and Key Stakeholders
ABSTRACT
An omni-channel communication strategy implies the full integration and simultaneous use of channels (offline and online) and touchpoints along the episodic volunteer experience or journey (pre-event or before the celebration of the activity or one-time event, event or during the celebration of the event, and post-event or after the celebration of the event). The purpose of this paper consists of exploring the extent to which the use of an omni-channel strategy by non-profits explaining the increase of loyalty of episodic volunteers, understood as the willingness to continue volunteering in other one-time events of a preferred non-profit organization. To do so, a quantitative-based research has been developed by conducting an online questionnaire survey from May 2017 to February 2018 to a representative sample of episodic volunteers of the Spanish Red Cross. 412 responses have been obtained from volunteers who have participated in one-time events organized by this non-profit. Ordered logistic regression analysis has been used to test the hypothesis proposed. Results suggest that the application of an omni-channel communication strategy may explain the increase on the loyalty of this type of volunteer.
