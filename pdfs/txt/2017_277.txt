Recognition of bone deformities in radiographs to identify strategic points of bone section in the use of a Ilizarov hexapod system
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT's) have made it possible for today's society to innovate and facilitate various areas of knowledge. With the advent of this evolution, interdisciplinarity arises between the areas of knowledge, which contribute to the evolution of technologies. In this aspect, the present work proposes to bring together the interdisciplinarity of computing areas, among them: robotics, algorithms and image recognition, as well as medicine, with orthopedics and correction procedures for bone deformities, through the union of the two areas, Replacing or assisting the process of bone deformity correction using Ilizarov Hexapod Systems (IHS), previously carried out manually by an orthopedic doctor specialized in IHS, through a partnership between the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco and the AACD (in Brazil) (Disabled Child Care Association), it was possible to glimpse this area of research little diffused.
