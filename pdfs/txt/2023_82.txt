Smart Healthcare Monitoring System For Healthy Driving in Public Transportation
ABSTRACT
In an age where citizens are constantly moving between different places, transport demand is extremely high, and so, it is important to have sophisticated public transportation systems in place to ensure a sustainable development of urban areas and meet the needs of citizens. Public transport operators consequently need to provide reliable services in order to minimize disruption events that can affect the vehicles and their drivers, such as breakdowns, accidents or illnesses. The project here described focuses on the type of events and approaches related with the vehicle drivers and the identification of both their performance profiles and health condition while in operation. For that purpose, existing nonintrusive technologies present on the vehicle are leveraged, able to collect data related to physiological measurements taken in realtime. Such sensitive data will be processed, stored and shared in a secure manner, using blockchain-based technologies, so that only authenticated and authorized parties will be able to access the data, according to their clearance level, through an Application Programming Interface (API) designed for that purpose. The architecture of the system will be microservices-based, with components deployed at different infrastructure levelsâ€”from On Board Units (OBUs) in vehicles up to cloud-based subsystems.
