Marketing Sensorial: Estudo de Caso da Starbucks : Sensory Marketing: Starbucks Case Study
ABSTRACT
The rapid development of markets with competitive products, which are difficult to differentiate, and more informed consumers, who demand memorable experiences, justifies the study of sensory elements that can positively influence these experiences. Sensory Marketing is thus a style of marketing that addresses all sensory perceptions. These are used to arouse emotions and create favorable reactions in the consumer to certain products or brands and stimulate their sale. This paper addresses the concept of sensory marketing, and then, through a case study, analyses all sensory experiences in the Starbucks company.
