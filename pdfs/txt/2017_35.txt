Improved teaching and conservation of natural sites through augmented reality
ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality is a technology that complements the perception and interaction with the real world and allows the user to be in an enhanced environment with additional information generated by the computer. In recent years the development of this technology in the educational field has taken a big rise. This article presents the development of scenarios for the conservation of natural sites through the Augmented Reality. For this purpose, a set of slides and a mobile application have been developed that allow elementary students to know about the importance and conservation of the natural sites of the province of Chiriqu√≠, in the Republic of Panama. The evaluation of the resulting products was carried out third grade students, obtaining excellent results.
