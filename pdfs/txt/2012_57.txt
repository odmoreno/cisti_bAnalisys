Applying PMBOKÂ® to teaching management in universities
ABSTRACT
Project management is a discipline with an established and consolidated body of knowledge which is collected in different models and standards. It is applicable in many professional areas. This article presents the results of an educational innovation project that has consisted in adapting some of the project management best practices to the organization and teaching of university courses in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). A guide to support teaching management has been developed and a set of materials to facilitate the implementation of different processes has been designed. Moreover, a website has also been developed to share all the generated resources, to collect the experiences and suggestions from teachers and to provide feedback for continually improving the whole cycle.
