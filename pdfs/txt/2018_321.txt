Community radio on the Internet, an analysis of the use of visual tools on Facebook
ABSTRACT
In the new scenario of digital communication, community radio assumes the challenge of media convergence that transforms one of its main characteristics, unisensoriality. In this way, the present article intends to analyze in an individual and comparative way the use of the audiovisual tools offered by the Facebook platform by the Community Radio of Ecuador and Peru. With this objective, a mixed methodology is proposed that uses the descriptive method through the quantification and qualification of the audiovisual aspects implemented by community radios. Based on this analysis, it is observed that although the media analyzed use audiovisual tools, not all of them present an adequate communication management of them, as well as media that do not take advantage of the audiovisual potential offered by Facebook. With this, it is concluded that the transition from analogue community media to the virtual world still requires a great work of transformation towards multimedia and the understanding of the characteristics of social networks and digital communication.
