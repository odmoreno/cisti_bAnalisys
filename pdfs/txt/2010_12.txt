“Digital projects”: A reflection and bridges to the future: Digital local agenda
ABSTRACT
Portugal started its “formal” path to the Information Society in 1997 with the creation of the "Green Paper on the Information Society". In 2000, the “Operational Programme for the Information Society” was created and based on three main pillars. Having been created as part of the second pillar, “Portugal Digital”, the “Digital Cities and Regions” initiative, aimed at developing the Information Society on a regional basis. In this article an overview is made on the purposes and results of the projects incorporated in the “Digital Cities and Regions” initiative. The goals of several projects were analysed. From this analysis a summary chart and a brief discussion of the Goals of the Digital Projects were made.
