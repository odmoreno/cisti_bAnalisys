Content Analysis of projects financed in the Autonomous Region of Madeira using Business Analytics tools
ABSTRACT
With Portugal's entry into the European Union in 1986, the country has received several financial support from EU funds. Portugal 2020 is one of the interventions for the application of these funds, which is structured in 16 programs. Madeira 2020 is included in this program, and for its intervention 13 thematic objectives were defined, which constitute a priority in the application of funds. This article aims to present a qualitative analysis of the data related to projects approved under the allocation of European funds in Madeira, using Business Analytics tools. To this end, we will analyze the explanatory summaries of each project associated with thematic objective 12 - Overperiphery Costs, in order to identify the most repeated words mentioned in these projects by the various beneficiaries. Once the keywords were gathered, a word cloud was created, where it is possible to visualize the most common ones in all projects.
