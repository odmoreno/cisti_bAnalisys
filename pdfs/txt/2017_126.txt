Application for monitoring primary energy resources based on open source software
ABSTRACT
In the project a monitoring system where a study or analysis of the quantity, availability and performance of the primary energy resource is made, for which a monitoring system of primary energy resources developed in the General campus Guillermo Rodriguez Lara is implemented of the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas — ESPE, for which sophisticated equipment that capture the signals of environ­mental variables is used, the objective is to develop a software-based open source handling such information application, and allows obtaining and storing environmental data, to conduct an analysis of them favoring decision-making, incorporating them into a web platform, the application also calculates the energy produced the day before, thus achieving construct an assessment tool parameters for future projects, which serve the information obtained in the feasibility analysis to implement projects related to renewable energy, thus contributing to energy development.
