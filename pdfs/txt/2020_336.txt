Design Science Research for IS/IT Projects: Focus on Digital Transformation
ABSTRACT
To ensure that a research project is relevant and recognized as sound research by academics, organizations and the society in general, it must be demonstrated that the research has been rigorously planned and developed and is open to debate and verification. In this context, and to give credibility to the investigation, it is necessary to use an appropriate research method. And, there are several research methods to choose from. Within the research methodologies used in the scientific areas of Information Systems / Information Technology (IS/IT) and Digital Transformation (DT), the Design Science Research (DSR) method has emerged. This method focuses on the development of artifacts that extend the current boundaries of IT to improve business and organizational performance. After a brief approach to the subject area under research, in this article we study the DSR method. In the end we talk about the strategy to be used in the research under this method. The main aim of this paper is to argue that DSR is a research method suitable to research projects in the area of digital transformation.
