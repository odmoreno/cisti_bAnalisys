Integrating Cloud Computing in Education
ABSTRACT
The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm represents for industry and academia an unprecedented technological innovation in the area of ICT, making it possible to make available a variety of digital services and resources via the Internet with ease and at affordable costs. Higher Education Institutions (IES) view the cloud as an opportunity to modernize their services, but the diversity of architecture and number of cloud service providers has made it difficult for IES to choose the best platform to adopt. On the other hand, the permanent access to broadband Internet, the adequacy of internal IES management processes to cloud business models and security issues, are the main challenges for the integration of cloud computing in education. Since some cloud providers offer free services for educational purposes, this article presents partial results from an empirical study that explores the tools and services of the Google Cloud Platform for education in a b-learning tutorial program.
