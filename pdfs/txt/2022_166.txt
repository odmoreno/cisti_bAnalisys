Improving the sustainability of Irrigation Systems through Technology
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) exert a positive influence on the development of different areas (medicine, architecture, government, business, engineering) and agriculture does not escape this reality. Collection management consists of the development of activities and strategies to achieve the collection of debts. A collection management, to be effective, must take into account contact, communication, the business environment, mainly with ICT. In order to offer a tool that allows maintaining the sustainability of the Bambito Irrigation Association, in this project a Web Information System was developed to streamline the collection process of said association. The system provides timely information for both the client and the administrative staff, by establishing communication channels between the parties to obtain periodic updates on the progress of the clients' water consumption data, for a sustained change in behavior, helping to combat keeping data up-to-date and being able to make better decisions. The proposed application is based on the approach of new technologies, which allows agile development.
