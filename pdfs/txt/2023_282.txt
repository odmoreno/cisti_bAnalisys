Real-time monitoring and alerting system using Zabbix and Grafana software for wireless Internet access service management.
ABSTRACT
When there is no continuous monitoring system of the devices that make up the wireless network for internet service access, it is not possible to react in time to failures, nor to keep a record of its operation, not having a history of failures and conditions of the equipment, causing damage to them because they can not perform adequate preventive and corrective maintenance; which causes economic losses. This research shows the implementation of a real-time monitoring and alert system using ZABBIX and GRAFANA software for the management of the access points of a wireless internet service provider.
