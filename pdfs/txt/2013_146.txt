Combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques in the analysis of new technologies implementation in education: Using augmented reality in the visualization of architectural projects
ABSTRACT
In order to improve and optimize the acquisition of skills and competencies focused on the knowledge and understanding of three-dimensional space, the present paper proposes a new method of analysis in the incorporation of new visual technologies in the field of education for the degrees of “Architecture” and “Building Science and Technology”. The new method of analysis proposed is based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques (using Bipolar Laddering - BLA) to assess the use of augmented reality systems applied to university teaching. The novel combination of methods and usability studies is meant to focus on the opinion and perception of the student. With this evaluation, the teacher can modify and improve the methods of deploying technology in the university framework in order to achieve a collaborative environment of success instead of the more traditional lecture environment. The positive results from a first teaching experience where the proposed method has been used, which we present in the current paper, confirm the utility of the method and encourage further replications for standardization.
