Accounting Report in Inflation Times: : A tool for Decision Making
ABSTRACT
The business world needs accounting reporting that allows decision-making by those responsible. However, the current context is, completely, unusual, with many externalities affecting companies, which has led to a resurgence of inflation, with a strong impact on investment, financing, and operational management. The methodology is based on literature review on Economics, Accounting and Systems Engineering that allowed the empirical development, through a collaborative community, of the “inflation-test” platform. Thus, the article proposes a free and open platform, which will attract stakeholders’ communities to its ecosystem, creating services and helping the annual report through the exchange of knowledge.
