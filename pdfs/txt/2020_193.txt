Design of Model and Application Development for Agile Practices Assessment
ABSTRACT
The drive to create greater perceived value and proximity to their customers and markets has led organizations to become increasingly agile in their structures, business processes and information systems, identifying areas of inefficiency and inefficiency, in terms of value creation with its clients (internal / external) and markets. This article aims to present an evaluation model (of maturity), in the field of agile practices, from the context of the individuals and development teams to the organization in the management of their products, project / program management. where agile values and principles are the guiding axes throughout the model and its application.The methodology underlying to this article development was based on a systematic literature review and reference models and frameworks analysis in the thematic domain. The developed model is an added value since there is currently no multidimensional model (capacity and maturity levels versus the perspective of dimensions oriented to the individual, teams, products, projects / programs and clients), in the context that helps organizations to identify their status quo and to promote the implementation of agile practices.
