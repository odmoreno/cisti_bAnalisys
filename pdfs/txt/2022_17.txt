The Retail Sectorâ€™s Bet on Artificial Intelligence : The Portuguese Case
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, and increasingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) occupies a leading role in the world, being used in the most diverse contexts. The retail sector is just one of them. The starting question that originated this article is: is Portugal receptive to the use of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence in retail? In other words, what is the opinion of the Portuguese and residents in Portugal, as consumers, regarding the use of automation by retail companies? Based on the analysis of the answers to an online questionnaire (which obtained 132 answers), we will present our conclusions regarding this matter. The goal is to understand if Portuguese people / residents in Portugal are willing and interested in going to supermarkets like Amazon Go or Continente Labs (or Pingo Doce & GO NOVA). In addition, it is intended to understand the reasons that lead them to respond skeptically, so that, in the future, strategies may be initiated by the companies of the sector, which based on greater and better education, may clarify, and perhaps change their assumptions and convictions. The results of this study reveal that the Portuguese and residents in Portugal are not yet interested in using automated supermarkets, showing some mistrust and reticence towards this new technology, although they recognize that it can increase the speed and efficiency of the service. In fact, of the 37,1% of respondents that consider it quite attractive, about 84% believe it may have a significant impact on the reduction of time spent shopping.
