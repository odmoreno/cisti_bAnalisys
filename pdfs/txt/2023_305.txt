Designing and validating the gamification strategy model of a digital platform to promote extracurricular projects in K-12 schools : The GENE gamification strategy model
ABSTRACT
Knowledge of how to gamify learning activities according to the features of the education context and of how different game elements can be effectively combined to improve learners’ performance, particularly in K-12 education, is still scarce. Simultaneously, K-12 schools are expected to have a distinguishing role in preparing learners for the demands of 21st century societies and properly integrate innovative pedagogical solutions as part of their teaching and learning offer. This study presents a gamification strategy model resulting from the validation process of Fora d’aulas – a gamified digital platform to be used in K-12 schools to promote extracurricular projects and its users’ sense of community. The prototype validation was aimed at assessing the gamification strategy of Fora d’aulas based on Nieveen and Folmer’s quality criteria of educational solutions by means of participatory practices including researchers, K-12 school boards and teachers. Data collected in a meeting and two focus group sessions was analysed through content analysis. The study findings provided evidence that the gamification strategy model of Fora d’aulas ensures compliance with the criteria of relevance, consistency, expected practicality and effectiveness, and add to existing literature for providing guidance on methods to gamify digital learning solutions in K-12 education.
