Which factors influence the adoption of online self-service technologies by B2B customers of a Telecom?
ABSTRACT
Telecoms are companies that provide communication services. In 2020 a drop in Telecom's revenues is expected due to COVID and this impact will remain for future years, with higher drops in coming years. The adoption of Self-Service Technologies allows to solve the problem of selling and serve the customers on-line, increasing customer loyalty, reducing cost, fostering innovation and thus increasing revenues. The major research question for this work is: "Which factors influence the adoption of online self-service technologies by Business-to-Business customers of a Telecom?". In order to derive a conceptual framework to answer this question several theories where used: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), The Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and the SST attitude/intention model. A conceptual framework that drives the adoption of Self-service technologies in Telecom B2B segments was proposed and tested.
