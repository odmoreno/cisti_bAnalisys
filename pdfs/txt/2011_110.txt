A software tool for teaching to analyze the chaos in electronic circuits
ABSTRACT
The analysis of chaos is today a reality in the scientific world. Their applications are of great interest not only in mathematics and physics but also in engineering applications or in biology and ecology. We propose an accessible educational tool for the implementation and design of new, fundamental or simple chaotic systems using the PSpice code. It is a versatile software applied to electronic nonlinear oscillations modeled on a Network Simulation Method (NSM) which uses an electronic analogy. Students can implement and “see” the chaotic dynamics and the fundamental properties of the chaotic attractors. They can perform the synchronization between two or more chaotic oscillators, and also synchronize complex systems. In this work we have constructed several examples, among them a new Jerk system, using this model. Thanks to the simplicity of the NSM model and Probe Window System, simulations can be performed more easily and at a fraction of the time required using other methods of traditional designs using, for example, Spice or Matlab.
