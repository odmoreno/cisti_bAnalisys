Towards a framework that promotes integration between the UX design and SCRUM, Aligned to CMMI
ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a framework to integrate user experience design into the software development cycle. The proposal defines practices, principles, techniques and artifacts of user experience in organizations that use agile methodologies (SCRUM) in association with CMMI process areas and the dimensions prescribed in the maturity model for user experience design recommended by the Human Factors Institute. The evolutionary path is supported by SCRUM practices. The preliminary framework is based on systematic reviews of the integration of design and experience, agile methodologies, SCRUM and CMMI. The framework, as well as future studies, will be validated and refined by panels of experts and case studies.
