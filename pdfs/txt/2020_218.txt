Development of an inclusive multiplayer serious game for blind and deaf
ABSTRACT
The paper presents the development of an inclusive serious multiplayer game with Morse code as its theme, as well as describing methodologies and architectures for developing a serious game through specific concepts for the deaf (sign language) and blind (audio description). The preceding case has three game modes: classic one versus one, a cooperative mode between two players and a four-player game mode all. In order to validate this serious game performance and quality, the final product has three dimensions: pedagogical, ergonomic and technical. From the obtained data, it was possible to conclude that this game was proof that using accessibility guidelines during software development helps to promote not only an efficient integration of excluded communities, but also social inclusion and equity between players.
