The influence of social networks and the internet on the choice of tourist destination
ABSTRACT
Information plays a fundamental role in an economic sector with the characteristics of tourism, being, naturally, greatly influenced by social networks. Currently, the widespread use of these platforms, as well as their exponential growth, are causing radical changes in the scope of the demand for tourist destinations as well as in the promotion of the destinations themselves. With this study we intend to know the influence of the internet and social networks in the choice of a tourist destination. For such, a quantitative methodology was used through a questionnaire survey. It is concluded that social networks represent an important tool for the promotion of tourist destinations, and are also increasingly used to search for information about them.
