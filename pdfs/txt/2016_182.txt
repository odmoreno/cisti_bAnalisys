Performance and availability evaluation of storage services in private cloud
ABSTRACT
Cloud computing brings new technologies and concepts that favor communication services and data storage. Services like OneDrive, Google Drive and DropBox increase data availability and provides new features as synchronization and collaboration. This article aims to assess the availability and performance of a private cloud storage service. A set of models that use a hierarchical strategy is proposed to evaluate both availability and performance through the composition of reliability block diagrams (RBD) and stochastic Petri net (SPN) models. A case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models through a cloud storage service hosted in the Eucalyptus platform.
