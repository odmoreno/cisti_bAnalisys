Scrum solo: Software process for individual development
ABSTRACT
In Brazil there are several small software companies with only one developer (solo developer). In a survey conducted by Secretaria de Política de Informática of Ministério de Ciência e Tecnologia has been indicated that about 60% of market consolidated software companies started their activities with a single developer. The majority of these developers does not formally make use of a software process. At this point, this work aims to present a formal software process for solo developers - the Scrum Solo. Initially, the defined procedure was experienced in software development for the Laboratório de Inovação of Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. Afterwards, several students made use of Scrum Solo to elaborate their completion of course works. Nowadays, plenty software companies working with individual development benefit from the process described in this document.
