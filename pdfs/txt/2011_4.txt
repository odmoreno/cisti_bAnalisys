Fuzzy model for assessing adaptive skills in children with cognitive disabilities
ABSTRACT
One of the fundamental problems facing the evaluation of children with any disability, and particularly the assessment of adaptive skills in children with cognitive disabilities is directly related to the lack of feedback that have training programs, creating a failure to integrate these children into society, and in the long run in the workplace, which also affects their families. Despite the existence of different tools for generating inventory of skills and his goals as Adaptive Skills Inventory - CALS, Inventory Planning and Programming Services Individual - ICAP and Adaptive Skills Curriculum - ALSC among others, these tools are still used empirically and little automated, making it impossible to see clearly the most important aspects that affect the evolution in the learning of a person with disabilities. That is why in this article presents the development of a model based on the principles of fuzzy and neural computing to assess adaptive skills in children with cognitive disabilities, so as to generate an effective feedback tool for process learning from the management of incomplete fuzzy or vague information that characterizes the inventory of skills and its associated objectives.
