Diagnosis of an agile project in the academic field
ABSTRACT
During software development, it is normal that the process is subject to constant, regular changes. However, these changes should not compromise the result of the project, the stipulated budget, or even the delivery dates. When agile methodologies emerged, they came to help overcome the problems mentioned above. The adoption of agile methods has had a very strong growth in recent years, having a positive impact on software development, since it can handle and adjust to constant changes, without compromising the result of the product. Despite this, measuring agility is important for organizations to ensure that these methods are being leveraged and providing the best results for organizations. In this paper, a proposal is presented for a tool that meets these needs in an academic setting to make projects and the teams themselves more agile, mentioning the points of possible improvement. A questionnaire was created that covers the main goals of agile methodologies and is based on the agile manifesto.
