Software design for the evaluation of competency based learning in engineering careers Ontological approach for modeling
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, in engineering careers, it is necessary to carry out activities that allow evaluation of the training process based on professional skills. This implies generating mechanisms that enable the assessment of learning based on quantitative and qualitative criteria from which competence levels of learning are defined. In this sense, it is necessary to arbitrate the means to determine performance of students before real or simulated activities of the future professional context. In this work, authors propose an ontological model as part of the design of a software. It involves the definition of the evaluation activities for the learning process based on competencies in engineering careers, such as definition of level of domain indicators, criteria and evidence determination, weights and scores specification, which accredit professional performance and stimulate the necessary feedback to complete this process. In this way, authors seek to collaborate with professors, academic management staff and other university actors who want to improve the quality of learning through new educational paradigms such as learning by competencies, since carrying out an appropriate evaluation is a task pending in education in general, and in the training of engineers in particular, mainly because of its complexity.
