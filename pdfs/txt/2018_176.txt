Industry 4.0 in Tâmega e Sousa's region in a twofold perspective: Industry vs IT enterprise
ABSTRACT
The 4th industrial revolution is forcing industry towards its technological, productive and human requalification. In this paradigmatic shift, technology plays a key role and organisations must know, understand and dominate the intricacies of industry 4.0. However an issues arises: aren't we putting technology ahead of the processes?. The truth is that I40 project are being implemented in different velocities in different companies and regions, even a small country like Portugal. Actually, despite of industries leaders agreed on the importance of the technological requalification (maybe pushed by the mediatism of the 4th industrial revolution), there is a lack of installed capability to embrace such projects. This concern is amplified when considering Portuguese sub regions. The impact of the I40 concept in the Portugues sub regions is the main motivation for this study on the Tâmega e Sousa region. The study combines the perspective/situation of the industry and the software houses. The way the I4.0 concept is being understood by the organisations in the Tâmega and Sousa region, and the degree of preparation for the phenomenon is discussed in this paper. The awareness of the lack of preparation of the organisations for the adoption of I40. strategies or I4.0 projects I4.0, together with the inability of the region's software houses to reverse this situation, led to the presentation of a practical set of recommendations. The framework of recommendations pragmatically translates the different dimensions associated with the challenges inherent in I4.0.
