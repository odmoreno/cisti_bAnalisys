Key performance indicators as stimuli to increased patent applications in Portugal
ABSTRACT
Research in several areas, in the academic environment, become new patents that are registered and controlled by the National Institute of Industrial Property - INPI. With the objective of assisting in the culture of academic productions that can be turned into patents, the present work seeks to stimulate these requests through the creation of multiple Key Performance Indicators, specific to each cycle of higher education, that can be used by any institution in Portugal. For the elaboration of these indicators, it was used mathematical correlations in the official data of the Portuguese government, in the period from 2007 to 2018, in relation to the number of students and those of patent applications. Therefore, after adequate treatment of the data, it was possible to estimate such key performance indicators, oriented by level of training and according to the objectives of each institution.
