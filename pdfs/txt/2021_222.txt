Formative Quizz : An Informatic Platform and a Pedagogic Experiment
ABSTRACT
The closure of schools caused by the pandemic situation and the consequent transition to distance learning during the first confinement starting in March 2020 and now during the second term of 2020/2021, exposed the schools, students and families to enormous challenges and countless difficulties. This scenario motivated the implementation, by schools, of numerous strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of this confinement in terms of student learning and their involvement with the school.In this context, an innovative pedagogical experience is presented in this article, in terms of the assessment of students' learning, which has been running since January 2019 in a school on the 2nd and 3rd cycles and secondary in the Porto area. This experience implies the frequent use of formative assessment quizz with automatic correction and immediate feedback to students, parents and teachers. The intensive use of this pedagogical tool during periods of distance learning, in this educational context, had a positive impact in terms of students' commitment as well as their involvement and interconnection with the school and teachers, mitigating the negative effects of distance learning. at these school ages and levels. In this article, this pedagogical tool (micro-evaluations) is described in more detail, giving an account of its main characteristics, functionalities and the database architecture that supports it. The main figures for the implementation of this experiment and some of the preliminary conclusions that can be drawn from this study are also presented. Being a pedagogical tool with proven effect in terms of students' learning and its functionality and web connection, it becomes particularly useful in the school context, both in terms of distance and face-to-face teaching, leading to the discussion of the future challenges of using tools online in school context.
