Haptic MIDI Controller Interface on Touchscreen Devices
ABSTRACT
The present study is part of a development of the theme Musical Interactions and consists of a project focused on interactions with touchscreen devices, namely through the use of hybrid interfaces, using multi-touch technology and modular TUI (Tangible User Interface) objects for performance and musical control. Its main objective is to create an interaction solution from hybrid interfaces that allow to combine the advantages of the traditional controllers with the new possibilities of the touchscreen devices, emphasizing an indispensable characteristic in the musical interaction: the haptic feedback. Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and Action Research (AR) were, due to their iteractive and complementary characteristics, the methodologies chosen for the development of the design solution of this project.
