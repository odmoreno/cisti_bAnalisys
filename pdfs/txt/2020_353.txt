Management of innovation and social networks in the Ecuadorian hotel sector : Empirical study in the first category and luxury hotels in the city of Loja
ABSTRACT
Companies in the tourism sector, such as hotels, operate in a very dynamic and competitive environment, which demands ever greater demands and demands from its clients. This work is carried out in the city of Loja - Ecuador and focuses on carrying out an innovation management audit, as well as analyzing the use of social networks as they become strategic tools for proper administration. The main results obtained indicate that the hotels studied tend to a greater extent to the management of continuous innovation, where the dimensions of "learning" and "relationships" are those that require greater management in relation to the drive for innovation. Regarding social networks, the use of Facebook was analyzed using the Fanpage Karma tool and its main indicators. An inadequate management of this social network is determined because the commitment to its fans and followers is weak, in the best of cases only 1.0% of them have interacted with the publications made, a similar fact is reflected in the performance of the page. Consequently, the information, opinions or experiences of current and potential clients are being wasted, which will greatly limit the contracting of services, decision-making and competitiveness in the developing sector.
