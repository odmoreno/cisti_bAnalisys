The new media became an extension of the traditional media, allowing to the public access information in a wide range of digital devices. In this sense, our qualitative study with empirical descriptive nature focuses on a literature review about Web Radio and its educative strand. This is an innovator and incipient issue on literature when investigating the potentialities of the radiophonic universe to the online educative process. By itself, the fruitful study follows the path of the radiophonic evolution integrating the online education on the media sphere, especially on the production of educational content to the programs and the conception of a new language to the environment, a promising ambience to the contemporary radiophonic culture. This investigation considered it important to analyze the educational potentialities of web radios in the Portuguese academic universe. For that purpose, given the characteristics of the study, the research methodology used was of qualitative and empirical-descriptive.
