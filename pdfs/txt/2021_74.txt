Circumstantial reasoning : Creation and management of open access repositories in Peru
ABSTRACT
Part of the results of a study on the creation of open access repositories in universities and research institutes in Peru are presented here. Fieldwork was conducted in ten institutions in 2014, through thirty long-term semi-structured interviews. The central argument is that the creation of repositories rests on the casual and informal use of ideas, people and artefacts in concrete circumstances, which are accountable by the very actors who were involved in them. From a relational standpoint, the creation of repositories can best be understood as an everyday phenomenon that takes shape from the margins (bottom-up), without a prior normative, social and technical order.
