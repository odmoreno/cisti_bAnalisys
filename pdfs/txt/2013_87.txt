A Field, Tracking and Video Editor tool for a Football Resource Planner
ABSTRACT
The current Football Resource Planning (FRP) systems integrate both internal and external information management across the entire professional football organization, including features to gather automated information from the teams, not only on the competition part but also on the preparation. In this paper, we present three of those tools from the Footdata's web/cloud FRP system: Field Editor (FE), Tracking Editor (TE) and Video Editor (VE). The FE provides the coach with a platform where he can represent the tactical movements for his team within an animated context. On the other hand, the TE allows the interaction with the Footdata tracking system. Finally, the VE tool offers the possibility for a coach to watch, cut and analyze football videos.
