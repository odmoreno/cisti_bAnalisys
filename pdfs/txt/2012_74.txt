Definition of an agent-based model of the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes
ABSTRACT
This work describes the architecture of an agent based computer model that simulates the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes in a three-dimensional cubic volume representing a fragment of pancreas of a mouse. Immune cells and β-cells are modeled as agents, making the abstraction of one cell - one agent. We present our preliminary results for the interactions between β-cell agents and macrophage agents and a model of cell motility in the continuous three-dimensional volume. This agent-based approach allows implementing multi-scale computational modeling capturing subcellular characteristics into cell agents and obtaining outcomes from agent populations at tissue and systemic levels.
