Industry-Academy Collaboration in Agile Methodology: a Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Industry-Academy Collaborative Research (IAC) in Software Engineering is being applied and developed widely in practice. These collaborative, research practices help both academic and software industry environments. As a way of observing what is being developed in SE, the objective of this article is to present an exploratory and empirical study of IAC practices in the context of Agile Software Development (ASD), exploring and characterizing solutions and practices, the challenges encountered in the application of the IAC and in collaboration. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out in the five main academic databases, and snowballing was applied, evaluating/analyzing 8.460 articles, totaling 21 articles approved following the proposed criteria. As a result of the data analysis, 76 good practices and 37 challenges in carrying out the IAC were described. As well, practical collaborative models for the application of the IAC were detailed.
