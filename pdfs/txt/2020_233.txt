Educational Platform for Personal and Community Protection Situations from the Perspective of Soft Targets
ABSTRACT
In the case of violent attacks, professional help is often unavailable for many minutes before they arrive. Citizens who are at the scene of an attack are the only ones who can react immediately. A prompt and effective response is often a key aspect that determines the number of victims. The security potential of citizens is an important part of the response and resilience of the soft target. Many citizens are aware of and accept this responsibility. They educate voluntarily for the case of a violent attack. However, they acquire this knowledge unsystematically. Our educational platform takes advantage of the multimedia form of education. It contains first-person video sequences in which the user is exposed to a violent security incident. The incident is divided into many points where the user decides what to do next. Based on these decisions, the student will see the consequences of their decisions and recommendations for improvement. User abilities and equipment are defined according to the input questionnaire. The video simulator shows the user the options he would have if he were to live in this situation.
