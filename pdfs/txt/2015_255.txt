RAIN in indoor rescue training
ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on the process of developing a framework that features Multi-Agent System and Fire Simulation in a game engine, resulting in a gaming infrastructure which may be played as a serious game to train users for emergency situations. Scenarios are generated dynamically with different types of characters controlled by the computer, Non-Playable-Characters (NPC). The computer controlled firefighters will go for rescue in an indoor fire scenario, while the player is able to either help them by playing a fellow firefighter or just watch the NPCs solve the situation. These NPCs are made using a Unity3D plug-in named RAIN to speed up the development process, which helps modelling the perceptions of the agents and their behaviours. These processes will be described and the result is a rescue simulation tool showing advantages in debugging behavioural models, which leverages the creation of these types of simulations. The less the player realizes that a firefighter is in fact an NPC being treated as another human player, the more likely the player is expected to behave socially. The current version of the simulation environment is available for download and free to play so readers can test and experiment with the implemented framework.
