The Impact of Social Responsibility of Companies Performance: the case of IBEX 35
ABSTRACT
This work aims to assess the impact of Social Responsibility on the performance of companies listed on IBEX 35 in the period from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2019. Two performance evaluation measures were used, one more internal to management itself, ROA, and the other of wider interest for eventual investors, average share price. To achieve the proposed goal, it was used the panel data methodology, resorting to the OLS estimation method. The results confirm the importance of social policies in the performance of these companies, both internally and externally to management. Not only the managers, who often decide based on outside noise, but also the society in general that realizes the advantages of these policies to encourage social well-being.
