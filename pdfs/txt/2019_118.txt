A Custom and Dynamic Game using Gamification Techniques to Children from 4 to 5 years old
ABSTRACT
The learning process in children is currently a complex activity, since children tend to lose concentration easily. In many cases it is difficult for the teacher to identify if the children were able to understand the class. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to improve the learning process of the English language through a dynamic game. For this purpose, an interactive game was developed with a focus on gamification, where children have fun learning. The result of the game was satisfactory; in the game the children listen and see the fruits and colors on the screen. An initial test of teaching fruits and colors was done in a traditional way “Teacher - student”, in this first case of a total of 24 children, 17 understood their teacher. On the other case the test “Game - Student” demonstrated the success of the game with 21 children who understood what the game showed and improved their rating, and that is the proposed in this research.
