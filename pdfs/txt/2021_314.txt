Interactive Learning in decision-support: an application to Fraud Detection
ABSTRACT
Usually, Machine Learning systems are seen as something fully automatic. Recently, however, interactive systems in which human experts actively contribute towards the learning process have shown improved performance when compared to fully automated ones. This may be so in scenarios of Big Data, scenarios in which the input is a data stream, or when there is concept drift. In this paper, we present a system for supporting auditors in the task of financial fraud detection. The system is interactive in the sense that the auditors can provide feedback regarding the instances of the data they use, or even suggest new variables. This feedback is incorporated into newly trained Machine Learning models which improve over time.
