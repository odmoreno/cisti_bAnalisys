Effective meetings: With a focus on the emotions and the conversations to improve the capital in the organizations
ABSTRACT
If the meetings within the organizations properly fulfill their purposes would be of a high strategic value. However, they are often considered as inefficient and ineffective. The organizations invest time and resources in improving their productions and organizational processes but not in optimizing their meetings. When they do so, usually they do not get the results expected. At first glance, it seems an issue of an easy solution but it is not, because it is connected to the complexity of human beings. The traditional conception associates a meeting with a time or physical space where issues that are in a list of topics are addressed. Through the proposal that we have successfully worked in the organizations we outline that the meetings are rites of conversational networks and organizational processes. This understanding opens a wide range of possibilities and opportunities of optimization.
