A framework to orchestrate security SLA lifecycle in cloud computing
ABSTRACT
Security issues of cloud computing environments are considered a major challenge for its full adoption. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) corroborates the shared management vision provided by the cloud computing paradigm, which can assist with related security issues. The necessity to address security requirements in cloud computing SLAs is considered important for both providers and consumers, along with the tools and mechanisms necessary to deal with these requirements. These issues are current research challenges; therefore, this paper aims at proposing a framework to orchestrate the management of cloud services based on security requirements defined by the SLA in an automated manner during its entire lifecycle. In addition, mechanisms to support the phases of the SLA lifecycle are proposed as a part of the framework. also the preliminary validation of the proposed framework. Finally, it is presented the integration of the framework with a cloud solution and in what manner the SLA lifecycle is supported by the framework.
