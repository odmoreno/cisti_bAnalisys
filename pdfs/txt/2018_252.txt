Analyzing learners' experience in e-learning based scenarios using intelligent alerting systems: Awakening of new and improved solutions
ABSTRACT
E-learning students tend to get jaded and easily dropout from online courses. Improving the learners' experience and decreasing dropout rates in these e-learning based scenarios is the main purpose of this study. This paper shares the results obtained so far and crafts an initial comparison with new and emerging commercial solutions. In a first stage, the objective was to focus the study and research made up till now (background, state of the art, survey and interviews to detect motives and behavior patterns). In a second phase, the development, tests and validation of a functional prototype of an Intelligent Alerting System to allow and evaluate concepts, collect statistical data on its effectiveness, analyze and discover if course completion rates are really improved. Finally, some related work is focused, as well as the enlightenment of new, emerging and improved commercial solutions, conclusions and an opening comparison with the proposed solution.
