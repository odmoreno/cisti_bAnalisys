Administrative modernisation and e-government: The case of Águeda
ABSTRACT
A major goal of governments today is to provide quality services, being their biggest challenge to implement tools that meet citizens' needs. For many years, the various levels of public administration, including municipalities, worked in a bureaucratic logic, making it difficult to provide services of excellence. E-government tried to overcome this problem. This article will analyse the impacts of administrative modernisation in a Portuguese municipality, Águeda, based on documentary analysis and interviews to senior officials of that municipality.
