Robotic Services in Smart Cities: An Exploratory Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Smart Cities are the result of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) through systems and technological tools and their application to urban projects that, based on the use of sensors, monitoring systems, wireless networks, autonomous devices and mobile applications, collect data that serves as source for proposing viable solutions to social problems aimed at improving the quality of life of its citizens. To this end, this article presents an exploratory literature review, which brings together several projects in areas such as agriculture, air and land traffic monitoring, cleaning services, education, healthcare, surveillance, emergencies, tourism and environment, as well as information regarding usability, management and storage of data related to the use of robotic systems in service management in Smart Cities.
