Cyber risk assessment A conceptual framework for executives
ABSTRACT
The convergence of digital ecosystems, connectivity, data and peopleâ€™s behavior establishes the new benchmark for the digital transformation of companies and how to create new experiences, services and products that change the way of doing things. In this sense, new and innovative digital initiatives for companies are emerging, as well as an unprecedented scenario of cyber threats and risks that challenge corporate digital strategies. Therefore, this paper presents a conceptual and practical proposal for the assessment of cyber risk by executive teams, in order to appropriate the dynamics and treatment of such risk and make concrete decisions that allow the organization to navigate in the current digital context challenges and deliver the promise of value to its customers despite the inevitability of failure.
