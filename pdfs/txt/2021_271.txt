Designing an application to support game-based learning: gathering functional requirements from a qualitative approach
ABSTRACT
This article seeks to contribute to the deepening of knowledge when designing game-based learning activities. During the design process, the specification stage is particularly relevant, being the functional requirements an important component of this process. Qualitative approaches to its gathering have gained relevance and aroused interest within the scientific community, being of most importance to describe studies that use these methodologies. This study describes the gathering of functional requirements, from a qualitative approach, to design an application for cataloging and evaluating educational games. A focus group of eight experts was set up; the functional requirements of the application were gathered according to the Communicative Design Paradigm, aiming to identify the indicators of the proposed application, using the Octalysis gamification framework.
