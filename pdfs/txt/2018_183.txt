Evaluation of e-learning activities with NeuroSky MindWave EEG
ABSTRACT
Difficulties in learning can occur in processes related to the attention or interpretation of spoken or written language. Nowadays, technological tools present the possibility of generating computational contents that facilitate the cognitive process for the improvement in this type of difficulties. For the correct and precise use of the tools and activities it is essential to determine which are the ones that best fit the students' educational profile, this can be determined through the analysis of brain signals using sensors such as the neurosky device that determines the different levels of attention of people when they carry out an activity. This article shows the result of evaluating the levels of attention in children, taking into account the brain signals to implement an adaptive computer system that shows the educational activities taking into account the level of attention.
