Process Mining - case study in an industrial assembly process in the shopfloor
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the application of process mining techniques to data of a production process of Huf Portuguesa, a company of production of automotive components. Huf uses state-of-the-art technology and maintains a close connection with research, seeking to keep itself updated through the acquisition of new knowledge, technologies and procedures. The process analyzed is the production of a certain component. There is a predicted procedure and, through the use of process mining tools, the process was analyzed to see if it is in compliance or if there are deviations. The obtained results allowed to understand the behavior of the process, the identification of deviations and the correction of some behaviors. These results can be used so that failures can be minimized and productivity and quality can be maximized.
