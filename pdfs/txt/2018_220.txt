Didactic forums of eLearning platforms vs. social networks and cellular telephones applied to teaching learning: A case study applying learning analytics
ABSTRACT
Universities and institutions began to create their virtual campuses by using eLearning platforms whether commercial or not. Within these, it has highlighted among other tools instead of the didactic forums where students among themselves and students and teaching teams could discuss and in general build knowledge within a collaborative context. The data coming from these forums have been analyzed, with different techniques, and have allowed obtaining some very interesting conclusions. However, in recent academic years there is a clear trend of migration of collaborative work that previously occurred in the forums to social networks and mobiles. This poses a problem since these tools are not coordinated by the teaching teams. The present work analyzes this trend and points out the consequences to which it may give rise.
