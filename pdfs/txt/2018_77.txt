eCommerce business-to-business platform for the footwear sector: The cluster of Felgueiras
ABSTRACT
The Portuguese footwear industry is aware that success in the value chain is directly tied to information sharing and the development of collaborative networks, which are consequences of the constant rapid market changes. In this paper a state-of-the-art of the Portuguese footwear sector is presented, giving special focus to the cluster of Felgueiras and the good practices that are applied to it. Next, B2B and eCommerce domains will be discussed, as well as the good practices and information systems that support them. Afterwards, a list of functional and non-functional requirements, which have been validated and prioritized using a case studies approach, will be presented. Finally, it will be presented a nonfunctional prototype for an eC-B2B platform for the footwear sector.
