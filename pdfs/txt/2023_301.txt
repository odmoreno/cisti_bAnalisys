A Systematic Literature Review on Learning Assessment Instruments in Online Teaching
ABSTRACT
Virtual Learning Environments began to be adopted more frequently due to the demands generated by the pandemic and the need for new teaching and assessment methodologies, especially in Higher Education. Many evaluative practices today are directly associated with Online Teaching, and it is necessary to point out elements that indicate the appropriate choice of the Assessment Instrument in Online Teaching. The research aims to propose a distributed system that helps in the adequate indication of the choice of the Assessment Instrument that will be applied, based on the studentâ€™s Learning Style. To do so, we will use a Multiagent System that reasons and proposes the indication of the Assessment Instrument being closer to the student's Learning Style so that the best use of the results obtained in the assessment is obtained, contributing with metric indicators that represent the understanding of the skills and skills achieved. Thus, our study, still under development, is a Systematic Literature Review and seeks to survey the state of the art of research related to Online Assessment.
