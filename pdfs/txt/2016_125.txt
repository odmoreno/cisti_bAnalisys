Information system to manage the evaluation of performance of education professionals in a pre-school â€” A model in development
ABSTRACT
One of the most important issues nowadays is to prepare our children to create a better world in the future. This is an education issue that starts in the very beginning of their lives. How can day care centres and pre-schools contribute for this goal? Our children spend most of their first years in these institutions, and parents trust the teachers and other professionals of education to do a good job with their kids. In fact, the most important figures in this equation are the education professionals that work directly with the children. Having this in mind, one of these institutions' main concerns should be to have a clear view of what goes on in the workspace everyday between the professionals and the children. The aim of this work is to propose a model for an information system that reports relevant information regarding the evaluation of education professionals. With this information, pre-school directors can have a much better understanding of what is going well, and what needs to be changed in the institution, in order to provide better care for the children.
