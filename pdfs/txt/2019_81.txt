Assisted Navigation Tools for People with ReducedMobility
ABSTRACT
People with reduced mobility are faced with obstacles and routes that are poorly designed to travel, which significantly affect the satisfaction of their mobility needs. Although there are already several options for applications in the area of assisted navigation, there are still a reduced number of applications that consider the specific needs of these people. This article describes the development, as proof of concept, of an assisted navigation application, for people with reduced mobility, which allows the analysis and determination of optimized routes, considering the physical condition of the user, the distance and inclination of the routes, the type and state of the pavement, and the existence of any temporary or permanent barriers. The application also provides a management module that allows the real-time updating of existing barriers in the routes and the identification of points considered of utility and interest for the target audience of the application. In order to validate and improve the prototype, a focus group was formed consisting of elements from the health and pedagogy areas, and elements from the technical services of the university whose campus was selected for the prototype implementation.
