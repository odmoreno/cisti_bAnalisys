Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC): Chronic care model â€” Information for chronic disease management
ABSTRACT
During the last decade, many countries have been reorient their health systems in order to progressively include integrated management of chronic disease, where diabetes mellitus (DM) is also included. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) has often been the theoretical framework supporting the action accordingly and the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) the most used instrument in measuring their level of implementation. Thus, the present study aims to contribute to improving information systems and clinical decision support in the management of diabetes as a Chronic Disease. Also aimed to make the translation and validation of the ACIC 3.5 and assess what level CCM is applied. The ACIC was applied to 175 doctors and nurses in primary care, belonging to a group of health centers. We defined the level of significance of 5%. In terms of results, it is observed that the ACIC Version 3.5 achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.958, indicating a high reliability and a coefficient of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin of 0.918, demonstrating that our data show excellent suitability for factor analysis. The group of health centers studied only guarantees a basic support to people with diabetes. In terms of applicability of the results of the CCM used in the care provision of the diabetic person and the family, let predict a long journey to make in this area.
