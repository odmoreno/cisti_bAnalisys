WCAG-Easy Tool : A tool based in the WCAG to learn web accessibility
ABSTRACT
The large number of people with disabilities in the world, in line with the importance of using the Internet in our lives, makes web accessibility a fundamental factor for an inclusive society. Despite this, inaccessibility is still a problem on current web sites, and the lack of knowledge on the part of those responsible is a major contributing factor. Aiming to support the teaching/learning process of web accessibility, this article describes the process of creating and validating the WCAG-Easy Tool, a WCAG 2.1-based tool that can be used to teach web accessibility concepts and practices to developers and students.
