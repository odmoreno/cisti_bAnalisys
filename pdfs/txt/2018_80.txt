An application for traffic analysis and optimization of network infrastructures
ABSTRACT
A communication infrastructure is not always easy to manage and the level of difficulty increases with the size and number of devices present in the network. Thus, the monitoring of a network is a fundamental process in that it may prevent or detect possible problems, also offering several auxiliary tools for the work of a computer network administrator. In this context, this work presents a novel platform for the monitoring and optimization of network infrastructures, which interface is easy and intuitive to analyze even for those who do not have high skills in the area of computer networks. Furthermore, and unlike most of traditional monitoring systems, the developed platform has an additional optimization module allowing the recommendation of possible changes/configurations in order to optimize the network resources.
