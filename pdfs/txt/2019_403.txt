ABSTRACT
Organizations, within their own context, present several needs that impede the strengthening of their management plans and processes. Likewise, there are elements that affect the organizational culture due to the lack of transparency and dissemination of management processes. It is necessary to mention that communication strategies are invisible in many institutional realities because they are confused with advertising schemes. By virtue of this, the Stakeholders are considered as interest groups, where the companies carry out actions to satisfy the needs of these communities, in order to develop their strategic objectives and corporate goals. In this article we analyze the incidence of these specific groups that consume the services and products of Ecuadorian companies. Reflections that are applied from the relevance of the work of the Stakeholders as a strategy.
