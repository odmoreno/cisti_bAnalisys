Design recommendations for the development of virtual reality focusing on the elderly
ABSTRACT
Due to the loss of physical and cognitive skills, older people may need special support to help them in daily activities. These activities can be a source of fun and entertainment, and at the same time improve their physical and psychological well-being. One of the options to meet the needs and expectations of the older people may be to use virtual reality (VR) games. For this purpose, it's important to identify design elements that make virtual reality games more suitable for the elderly audience. This study aims to check design recommendations extracted from previous research and also to identify new information that can contribute to the design of VR games focused on older people. In order to achieve this objective, we developed a virtual reality game for user testing with older participants. Participants' experience was recorded for qualitative analysis based on grounded theory. Besides a grounded theory, the results include a list of recommendations for games in virtual reality aimed at the elderly.
