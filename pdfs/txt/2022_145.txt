Technological Mediation in Remote Teaching During the Covid-19 Pandemic
ABSTRACT
The aim of this article is to present a synthesis of documentary research on technological mediation in the implementation of remote teaching based on the experience of the Brazilian educational group with the largest base of face-to-face students of higher education. The theoretical foundation of this study was based on the recent literature on remote teaching, in addition to philosophical studies on technology. Reports and documents from the researched institution were analyzed in order to identify data related to the use of technologies to ensure the continuity of pedagogical activities at the beginning and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results show that the inventions in information systems and technological mediation were fundamental for the rapid and successful pedagogical and institutional response of the researched group.
