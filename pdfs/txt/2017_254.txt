Principles for MOOCs design: Case study
ABSTRACT
In recent years, we have seen the appearance of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) allowing to spread knowledge on a large scale. These courses create learning opportunities, but also challenges in their design and implementation. This work presents a case study of the design of MOOCs in the health area, more specifically in the training on chronic pain. Principles and design methodologies are applied to create appropriate learning contexts. Additional tools are also used in order to, in addition to complementing the available contents, attenuate, in the development of competences, the differences resulting from the profiles of the students involved. The applied principles of design and tools guarantee both the success in the transmission of the contents and the involvement of the students thus preventing high drop-out rates that are normally recorded.
