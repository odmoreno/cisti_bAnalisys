Online corporate reputation strategies. Analysis based on the command chain position
ABSTRACT
Several previous research show that the reputation of the CEOs of big companies are closely related to the reputation of their companies [1][2]. These researches include some guidelines such us to include training to managers in social media and Online tools for reputational influence [3][4]. In the Spanish case, where large corporations are not the majority of the business, but are SMEs [5], an approach of this kind raises the question not only about CEOs but about the entire chain of command. The principle that all agents involved in a process of outreach contribute to this projection is applied [4]. This work in progress (short paper) focuses on the variation of the point of view when considering the different hierarchical levels of the chain of command. The study across 4 categories (CEO or Director, Senior manager, Middle management, technical staff) revealed homogeneous general trends but at the same time some specific differences which had to be taken into consideration. As a general conclusion, it was detected a need to strengthen the transmission policy of the strategy, at the several command levels, as discrepancies hinder the execution of the organization's plans.
