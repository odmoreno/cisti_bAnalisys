The effects of the practice of Nintendo Wii速 in the development of children in pre-school Education: Contribution of an investigation to supervised practice
ABSTRACT
The research carried out in the scope of the Master's Degree in Early Childhood Education and Teaching of the 1st Cycle of Basic Education had the purpose of verifying the effects of the Nintendo Wii速 practice in the development of children of Pre-School Education. We have chosen to combine two major research paradigms: qualitative and quantitative. The mixed methodology combined action research and exploratory case study. In the collection of data, several techniques and instruments were used: participant observation; field notes; audiovisual media; Psychomotor Battery; semistructured interview to three Kindergarten Educators and questionnaires to the Educators. The implementation of this study was carried out in seven sessions, using the Nintendo Wii速 and its accessories (2 Wii Remote and 1 Balance Board). The results of this investigation point to a contribution of Nintendo Wii速 in the scope of Physical Education in Pre-School children, contributing to the improvement of motor skills.
