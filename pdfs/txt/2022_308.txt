Cooperation as a determinant of the innovation process in services : Study focused on tourism companies in the Ecuadorian Austro
ABSTRACT
In the increasingly competitive global business environment, being an innovative organization that cooperates with its environment not only meets the needs of its customers, but also contributes to the success and future growth of companies. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine the influence of cooperation in the development of innovation in tourism companies. To achieve this objective, a quantitative approach was chosen through surveys and the hypotheses were verified through the Chi square statistical test. The results obtained showed that the relationship between innovation and cooperation, measured by the variables "internal and external sources of information, type of cooperative organizations and type of valuable partners", is not very significant. It is concluded that it is necessary to work on overcoming the weaknesses identified, since this will allow obtaining the benefits that companies that make decisions together have, face the current context and achieve objectives that would be impossible to do in isolation, giving way to the co-creation of innovative services.
