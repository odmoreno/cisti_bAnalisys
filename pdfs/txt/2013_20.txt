Use of a virtual platform as a supporting element for the acquisition of basic mathematical skills in engineering students
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the use of a virtual platform based on Moodle as a supporting element for the acquisition of basic mathematical skills. The project was aimed at first engineering course students whose initial mathematical knowledge presented some shortcomings. After the use of the designed online tools, there has been an increase in pupils' confidence in their mathematical skills and their chances of success in the subjects of mathematical content, all which has been reflected positively on the academic results.
