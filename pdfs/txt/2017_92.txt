Representation of science publications in open linked data from ORCID codes using ontologies to support a portal of scientific publications
ABSTRACT
The ORCID code is becoming the unique identifier for assigning authorship to scientific publications. This article describes the processes for representing, in an open - linked data format, the scientific publications of researchers of an university from the ORCID servers. Having the information in this way, there is an enormous potential to make accurate and interesting queries, and generate graphs from these data.
