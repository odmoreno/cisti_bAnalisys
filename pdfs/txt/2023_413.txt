FruitSort: the educational computational thinking game with accessibility for hearing-impaired children
ABSTRACT
This work addressed the teaching of Computational Thinking for children from 7 to 11 years of elementary school I for the teaching of logical reasoning. From studies on accessibility in games for children aged 7 to 11 years old, with hearing impairment, an inclusive game was developed to support the teaching of computational thinking in the learning of logic. For the development of the game, not only Computational Thinking were studied, but educational games for children with hearing impairment, in addition to web accessibility guidelines. As a result of the research carried out, an inclusive game, FruitSort, was implemented for children with hearing impairment, which addressed the Merge Sort Sorting Algorithm, to support the teaching of Computational Thinking through a playful and inclusive environment.
