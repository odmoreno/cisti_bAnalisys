Mobile Geographic Information System for Citizen Security
ABSTRACT
In today's environment urban security is one of the most important areas in the defense of territory of any country around the world. Because of this it is necessary to maintain order and the free mobilization of citizens without being victims of crime, therefore, is crucial for any government's agenda. This article presents the development of a mobile application for the security of the citizens with the aim of identifying UPC Police Communication Units in the city of Quito - Ecuador. The analysis of the information of each UPC (latitude and longitude) and other urban data will facilitate the mobility of any citizen in a territory as large as a capital of a country. In this study we have used techniques such as SCRUM for an agile software development and an SOA oriented architecture, which allows this application to be faster and more efficient. The results obtained in the test phase will allows us to verify that users download the application and use it to identify important points in the city.
