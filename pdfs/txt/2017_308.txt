Real time safe-return-home system for continental Portugal
ABSTRACT
In our society there are various forms of crimes that occur quite often. To diminish crime, a number of safe-return systems are being developed for vulnerable people. However these systems are focused mainly in response to situations in which the danger has occurred, with no effort to predict a possible crime. These predictions of danger situations can be done with the gathering of information concerning the surroundings of the user, in real time. A safe-return-home system should allow the users of the service, to be notified in a timely fashion of possible dangerous situations that occur near the user's location, in real time. These predictions are made through the analysis of various types of data about the surroundings of the user. The data collection and analysis should include information regarding news about crimes, accidents and disasters, and the user's location. Data analysis then allows to predict dangers, so that they can be visually recognized on the user's smartphone, making it possible to respond actively to these dangers, in real time.
