Components of a crowdsensing mobile architecture : Minimum elements that make up a crowdsensing architecture Mobile
ABSTRACT
In recent years the growing number of mobile devices [10] and their hardware potential with all the sensors that compose them and wireless intercommunication networks in our environments have evolved significantly giving greater service to users, also taking advantage of the information that these devices can produce, but generating some problems such as incompatibility in communication, processing, data analytics or an architecture that covers the different elements involved.The following article investigates the elements involved in a Corwdsensing Mobile architecture through a literature review to propose an architecture that ensures the proper functioning of the entire process.
