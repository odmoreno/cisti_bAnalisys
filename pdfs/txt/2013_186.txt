Trouble in Paradise: The mathematics in schools of engineering, a Spanish perspective
ABSTRACT
The teaching of mathematics in engineering schools has changed in the last 10 years irreversibly due mainly to two momentous events: the unstoppable emergence of the use of new technologies (ICT) in teaching and the establishment of European Space of Higher Education as a common teaching framework. This methodological change was made defeating, in many cases, resistance to change made by both teachers and students. New problems have also appeared from the constant regulatory changes. In this paper we address the three main issues that, in our view, affect the teaching of mathematics in the various Spanish engineering schools. The proposed solution passes through a targeted increase in teaching cooperation and design of new mechanisms for evaluation.
