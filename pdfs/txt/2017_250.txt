Use of game jam model in the develop of a educational board game
ABSTRACT
This paper presents research on identifying and implementation of "game jam " model in an organization dedicated to developing software that has different teams of engineers in various disciplines, such as software engineers, electronic and specialists in art and design Game jam has a promising approach in the rapid development of projects or new products. Our goal is to implement the Game jam model in productivity and innovation of multidisciplinary teams to design a prototype of educational board game as a contribution of e-education. As a result of the executed application, significant factors (participatory design, lightweight construction, product-value focusing, aesthetics and technology) were found, for the implementation of innovative strategies that use of prototyping of games focused on e-education.
