Business intelligence pervasive systems: BIPS model
ABSTRACT
Globalization, stalled economy, saturated markets, fierce competition, technological innovation, internet of things, are some of the factors that lead companies to rethink their business strategy. In this context, it is increasing the effort required organizations to adjust their business strategy in an ever more competitive environment. In this study we are presented the proposal of a conceptual model for of business intelligence pervasive systems (BIPS), the latter an important role in supporting the decision making process, to increase the competitiveness of enterprises, creating a symbiosis of information technology and business strategies. It is intended to take the first step to fill the existing gap in pervasive business intelligence systems, through the proposal of the BIPS model.
