Remote work and the challenges of the global search for talent: How companies in Portugal are adapting to a new reality
ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic changed how people live their lives. This change, in turn, heavily affected companies in the sense that they had to adapt to the new reality in many different ways. A process that had to suffer major changes was the recruitment one since a lot of the traditional ways to recruit employees were not suitable in this new reality, which led to the massification of e-recruiting. In this article, we investigate the ways that companies operating in Portugal adapted in order to compete in this new e-recruiting paradigm. To this end, we sent a survey to multiple companies, directed towards their recruiters and human resources managers, to collect data and feedback relating to this adaptation. We obtained 38 answers, from which we were able to find that it is very common for companies to offer the option of remote work, either full or partial, to their employees, even as the pandemic loses strength. Furthermore, we also found out that while the use of social media, like LinkedIn, for the task of e-recruiting is also becoming a lot more common, there are still reservations about some other e-recruitment processes related to Artificial Intelligence and serious games.
