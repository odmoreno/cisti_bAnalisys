Platform to Promote Regional Professional Ecosystems
ABSTRACT
Interest groups are made up of people who share at least one common interest. The dynamization of these groups can be promoted through software applications that enable the sharing of actions of common interest and promote interactions and cooperation between people and entities in that group. This article presents a platform that aims to help professionals interact in common interest groups, to share or consult information and promote discussion forums. This platform has web and mobile components through which data is shared and synchronized in order to be always updated. The development was done using the OutSystems low-code platform and REST webservices were also used, for web scraping, to consume data from other platforms present on the internet. During the platform development the Scrum framework was adopted, and system tests were performed to identify defects in the software, which were also solved. The platform was evaluated by a set of potential users for acceptance tests and the results show satisfaction with the usability and usefulness of the platform.
