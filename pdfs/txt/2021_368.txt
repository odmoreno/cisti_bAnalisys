Media and digital literacy : From particularities to encounters and possibilities
ABSTRACT
From the history and concepts of media literacy and digital literacy, certain key points that have been selected from an extensive literature review are presented. We conclude by proposing a meeting point for both literacies in the `critical digital literacy' (CDL) framework. We argue that CDL is adequate to tackle educational, political, and civic challenges, as it emphasizes material and discursive issues underlying new technologies and digital media.
