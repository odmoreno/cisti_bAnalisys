E-waste in Portugal â€” A higher education-based study
ABSTRACT
The use of electrical and electronic devices has grown exponentially in the last decade thanks to technological advances and its wide dissemination. On the other hand, the number of obsolete equipment has also increased significantly, becoming a major problem for society. This paper deals with electronic waste and explains the concept and risks for the particular case of Portugal. Measures to reduce the problem such as legislation, education production R&D and social responsibility are also discussed. And finally, a survey is presented which was carried out in two Portuguese Higher Education institutions with a view to determining students' awareness, attitudes and opinions on this matter.
