Decision support system for forest fires firefighting in Agueda municipality
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a system that is under development to support forest fires fighting in Agueda municipality. This system is mainly based on information technology, in contrast to the dynamic which is currently used in this municipality. The system consists of three separate modules, an WebGIS application and two applications for mobile devices (one for the land vehicles and the other to air vehicles). One of the biggest concerns about the system is that all data used is real and updated, but also that the main features of the application are used in real time by the main actors of civil protection: fire department, city hall and Republican National Guard. The implementation of the project is still at an early stage, however the tests performed so far have revealed that the system is viable and is expected to be an effective help in solving the problem of forest fires in the municipality.
