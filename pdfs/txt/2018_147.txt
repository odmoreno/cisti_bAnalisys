A software library for sign recognition through natural interface devices
ABSTRACT
We present a work in progress, on a prototype of a software library for sign recognition in the Brazilian Sign Language (BSL) through the combination of natural interface devices, which identifies visuospatial motions performed by the user and offers support to other sign languages. The goal is map body motions and recognize signs executed to train BSL students and teachers in educational games with different profiles and skill levels, using sensorial and wearable devices for interaction. We believe this library will reduce the barriers in communication involving deaf people, since it contributes to the creation of solutions focused in simplify and broaden the learning of BSL and other sign languages.
