Optimizing NFV deployment in Segment Routing
ABSTRACT
Segment Routing (SR) is an implementation of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for traffic routing. It derives from a source routing paradigm where each node, at the network's periphery, adds a list of labels to the packet's header defining explicitly the path each traffic flow should follow to its destination. Each label is a segment that identifies a topological instruction, a service, or even a processing instruction. Although SR can be very similar to Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), concerning the simple routing of packets, its utilization simplifies the network management tasks. On the other hand, SR provides solutions to existing scalability problems on SDN implementations, for example, OpenFlow-based. This technology is rapidly becoming a standard and is already supported by big players such as Cisco and Huawei, performing a fundamental role in the architecture of future 5G networks. Also, due to these new technology capabilities, there is an increasing number of novel services. This growth, allied with the rise of 5G capable devices, motivated the deployment of services on crucial points of the network. Consequently, mobile operators created the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concept. However, some important questions should be considered, such as how to optimize network resources regarding service locations to reduce the congestion level on the network. The main contribution of this work consists of exploring solutions based on SR and NFV. Thus, relying on optimization techniques to pursue optimal resource allocation for traffic routing and service processing requirements.
