SEO Websites evaluation of the hotels in Terras de Trás-os-Montes using Ubersuggest
ABSTRACT
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a digital marketing strategy that consists of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and positioning in search engine results. This is important because the vast majority of people looking for a service or product, such as a hotel, use search engines to find relevant information. By optimizing your hotel website with relevant keywords, meta tags, quality content and other important SEO elements, your website is more likely to appear on the first page of organic results when someone performs a search. In addition, SEO is also important to improve the user experience on the website, increasing loading speed, ease of navigation and content relevance. This can increase the time a visitor stays on the site and the chances of them becoming a customer. The aim of this article is to carry out an SEO audit of the websites of 4 and 3 star hotels in the Terras de Trás-os-Montes region.
