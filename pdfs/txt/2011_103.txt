From INGENIAS to an Interactive Storyboard using Alice 3D at prototype level
ABSTRACT
In the development of multimedia environments, it is necessary to create rapid interactive prototypes, which could validate the interface and functionality in a natural way by the production manager. In the world of video game we work with characters (agents), that play a role (roles), interact and perform actions and/or tasks according to their needs (mental state) to get the objectives. This is natural and usual in the Agent-Oriented Software Engineering. The challenge is to develop a tool that allows to automate the process that derive from a specification methodology based on INGENIAS to a 3D animated prototype using the development tool Alice. Specifically, this article shows how to specify a dialogue between two characters, that swapped an object with INGENIAS and how to create automatically a 3D animated prototype in Alice with the tool “Interactive Storyboard Generator-ISBGen”.
