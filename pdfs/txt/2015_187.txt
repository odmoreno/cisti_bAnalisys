A mobile public participation geographic information system architecture for collecting opinions about public services
ABSTRACT
One challenge of public service managers is to use collective intelligence to approximate the opinion of citizens for administrative decisions. The rapid advance of Global Position System (GPS) and technologies included in Web 2.0, followed by greater accessibility to these technologies by citizens through smartphones, can be used to include the population that is present in public establishment environments, with regard to the administrative process of their city. The denominated Public Participation Geographic Information System - PPGIS is characterized by encouraging the population to create voluntary information with geographical features. On this surrounding context, this article proposes an architecture able to use geoprocessing to bring closer the public service user and the manager of these services.
