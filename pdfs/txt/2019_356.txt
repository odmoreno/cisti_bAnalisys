Internalization of Negative Self-Image of the City
ABSTRACT
In times of crisis or traumatic transformation processes, one of the most frequent negative externalities is the deterioration of the self-image of the city between its stakeholders, which affects their economic and social expectations and decisions. The internalization (solution) of this externality, a necessary condition to achieve collective support and collaboration with any initiative to be carried out, has to be a priority objective of the local public manager. To this end, the application of city marketing and the communication instruments that this technology makes available to city managers, is postulated as a public management tool that allows optimal results.
