An agent model for the simulation of electrical vehicle charging management
ABSTRACT
This work describes the impact of integrating electrical vehicles (EV) in the electrical energy network, through the simulation of the electrical consumption of residential users in the absence of intelligent management strategies such as Smart Grids. The study is composed by a first data analysis stage of three types of family (small, medium and large) and a second stage describing a scenario simulation of EV integration using the identified consumption profiles. This simulation evaluates the electrical network limitations and other factors influencing the EV charging. The main results achieved are the charging curves for the residential consumption identifying the available power for the EV. The user profiles obtained will enable studies for assuring not only charging at residences but also in other charging points.
