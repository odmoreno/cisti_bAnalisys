Results of information systems planning: Articulation between vision, goals and policies
ABSTRACT
The existence of increasingly more sophisticated and modern information systems and technologies which may enable an easier collection, storage, processing and dissemination of information is paramount for the good performance of an organization. However, the planning of such systems must be effective, thus enabling the definition of the envisaged future of the organization's information systems. This paper approaches three predominant realities within the class of results of information systems planning, namely the vision, the goals and the policies. This approach focuses on how these three elements are articulated, on identifying the level where information systems security policies (policies under study in this work and not the organization's general policies) stand within the management of information systems, and also on identifying the way these three realities are expressed.
