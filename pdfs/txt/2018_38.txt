Exploring an enterprise architecture for higher education institutions: A proposal for the area of undergraduate teaching
ABSTRACT
This work, which is part of an ongoing project, presents the first steps of a proposal Enterprise Architecture (EA) for the area of Undergraduate Teaching in Higher Education Institutions. The University of Bío-Bío (Chile) is considered as a case of initial study, with the purpose of identifying strategic guidelines, processes, systems and information technologies, which will serve as a basis to define a model of AE, which will be validated in other institutions, in order to identify common patterns that allow building a general model of utility to support the development, management and operation of this area, and also collaborate, promote and facilitate the achievement of institutional goals.
