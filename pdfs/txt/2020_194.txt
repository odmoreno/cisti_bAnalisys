Cloud Computing Adoption Barriers Faced by Saudi Manufacturing SMEs
ABSTRACT
Cloud Computing is arguably the most significant technological development after the Internet. It accelerated technology adoption and gave birth to new business models. More importantly, it is acting as a foundation for new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Cloud Computing paradigm provides a level playing field for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as they are able to adopt technologies that were not affordable before. Governments, vendors and business support organisations across the world have a plethora of initiatives to encourage SME adoption of Cloud Computing technologies. Despite these initiatives, many SME decision makers are still hesitant to adopt the cloud. This research reports an engagement with 16 information technology (IT) managers working for Saudi manufacturing SMEs. This paper presents their perceived barriers to migrating their applications to cloud services.
