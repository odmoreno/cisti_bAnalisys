Remote control flying RC helicopter through natural user interface
ABSTRACT
The interaction between humans and various technological devices has always been limited by the communication between the user and the machine, this primarily because the machines do not possess the ability to interpret the natural movements of a person. In the case of remote interaction with unmanned vehicles (UAV) as cars, helicopters, airplanes, many researchers have resorted to the use of different types of hardware, including gloves, remote controls or video cameras are counted, however remote interaction suggests still a challenge. That's why in this paper the development of a natural user interface (NUI) for remote control of a RC (radio control) unmanned helicopter (UAV or drone) using the Kinect sensor, we propose and through a series of action commands defined by the natural movements of a person. To develop the system, initially proceeded with the conceptual design of the remote control, as well as the selection of sensors that allow the interaction of a person with a UAV. Then the action commands for control were specified to finally conduct a series of performance tests focused on evaluating the performance of the system against the commands executed by a user to control the selected UAV. The results showed a very efficient generic interface to control remote UAV, thereby generating a valuable alternative in the control of any type of unmanned vehicle through the use of the natural movements of a person.
