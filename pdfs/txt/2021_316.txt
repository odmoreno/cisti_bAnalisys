Social networks as a strategy for promoting agri-food products with a designation of origin in Ecuador. The case of Loja coffee
ABSTRACT
In Ecuador, the Loja coffee is considered one of the best in the country for being tall and its organoleptic benefits, characteristics that allow it to be classified as a differentiated coffee. These aspects were validated by the ecuadorian government to grant the Origin Denomination, a sign that confirms its particularities; however, empirically there is little notoriety in social networks. This affirmation is confirmed in the present investigation through the application of an online survey to consumers of the drink in the city of Quito, capital of Ecuador.
