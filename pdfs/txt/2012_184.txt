CAFCLA, a framework to ease design, development and deployment AmI-based collaborative learning applications
ABSTRACT
Ambient Intelligence promotes the integration of Information and Communication Technologies in daily life in order to ease the execution of everyday tasks. In this sense, education becomes a field where Ambient Intelligence can improve the learning process by means of context-aware technologies. This paper presents CAFCLA, a framework that allows developing learning applications based on the pedagogical Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) approach and Ambient Intelligence paradigm. CAFCLA integrates different context-aware technologies, so that learning applications designed, developed and deployed with it are dynamic, adaptive and easy to use by users such as learners and teachers.
