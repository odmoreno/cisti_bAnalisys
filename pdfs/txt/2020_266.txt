Information Systems User Satisfaction: Application of a model for e-Government
ABSTRACT
The growing increase in the digitization of government services points to the need to measure the success of the information systems used. One solution to evaluate these systems is to measure user satisfaction. The aim of this article is to present a model for measuring user satisfaction in information systems for government use. The research was of the descriptive type, carried out through a questionnaire to a sample of 1260 users of the system. The research model was calculated using structural equations via variance. The results revealed that the DeLone & McLean model is an adequate model for measuring government information systems. In this study, the model managed to explain 76.9% of user satisfaction in information systems, with perceived utility, quality of information, quality of the system and quality of services being the most important variables, respectively.
