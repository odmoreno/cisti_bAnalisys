Improved learning in the irrigation course using blended teaching
ABSTRACT
Irrigation is important for food sovereignty in the world. Therefore, it is necessary for civil engineers to acquire the competence for the design of pressurized irrigation systems. One of the ways to do this is with active methodologies such as hybrid methods, which have been used in various technical careers. The present research work aims to improve learning in the Irrigation subject of the Civil Engineering course at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja. For this purpose, Flipped Classroom and Problem Based Learning are used to carry out the hydraulic design of an irrigation network. In a preliminary and asynchronous way, the students reviewed the theoretical foundations of the subject that were inserted in a virtual tool. And through the development of a group project, it was possible to acquire the competence to design a real irrigation network. The results were very promising and are evidenced in the network designs made by the students.
