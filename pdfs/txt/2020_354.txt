Among these costs, the local tax system stands out, which we can interpret as the relative price of the city product, which allows its management under the approach that marketing, in its application to the city, gives to the price variable. From here, a benchmarking work is carried out that allows knowing the relative position of the city of Santiago de Compostela price and making proposals to improve its attractiveness against cities with which it competes for the attraction of target audiences.
