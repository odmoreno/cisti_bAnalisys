Twitter Sensitivity Analysis in a Higher School Using Power BI
ABSTRACT
Twitter, as a social network, acquires special importance in academic institutions, for example in Higher Education Institutions (HEI). This tool allows institutions to not only publicize their work and get feedback from the community about it, but also to keep in touch with their aluminum network and foster conversations between the academic community. In this work, a dashboard was created with the last 39 Tweets, related to this HEI, using the Power BI data visualization tool. From this analysis, we can assess users do not use Twitter do to debate ideas and collaborate, instead this platform is used mainly for topics related to academic leisure activities. This dashboard allows us to understand what is being said about this HEI on Twitter and how to improve the use of this communication platform.
