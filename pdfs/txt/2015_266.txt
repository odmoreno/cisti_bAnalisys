To meet requirements of International Audit Standards (ISA) which will be obligatory for polish SMP soon the special attention should be paid to an audit quality. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) has developed a Framework for Audit Quality that describe the input, process and output factors that contribute the audit quality at the engagement, audit firm and national level for financial statement audits1. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has published on May 2013 the list of Audit Quality Indicators which is a result of the Standing Advisory Group Meeting2. IT has been identified as an important factor which will have an influence on the profession of certified public accountants (CPA) 3. This paper aims to identify the processes and procedures in audit engagement which could be supported by CAAT in order to meet ISA requirements regarding audit quality.
