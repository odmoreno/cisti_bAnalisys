Purchase intention determinants of digital influencersâ€™ followers
ABSTRACT
The study analyses the importance that digital influencers assume in the intention of purchase of products and brands by their followers. Given the constant growth in the use of digital platforms by consumers, companies are increasingly turning to digital marketing and communication through digital platforms to reach their target audience. In this context, the appearance of digital influencers, evidencing a relevant role in the consolidation of many brands, has become fundamental. For many content managers, influencer marketing remains a mystery. There are no defined rules and the terrain has not yet been sufficiently explored. Thus, the purpose of our work is to ascertain the main determinants of loyalty to digital influencers, which, in turn, contribute to the purchase intention of their followers. Thus, it aims to fill a gap in research regarding the attributes of digital influencers that are deemed decisive in building loyalty to these same influencers, which drives their followers' purchase intention.
