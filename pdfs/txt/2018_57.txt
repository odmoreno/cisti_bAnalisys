A case study in the pharmaceutical sector in Portugal The implementation of an automated system at Farm√°cia Giro to increase competitiveness
ABSTRACT
The evolution and advances in technology bring with them a strong necessity of fast adaptation of the multiple industries and sectors, in order to meet market requirements. This paper is a case study based on qualitative research, which addresses the implementation of an automated system in a Portuguese pharmacy. The aim was to understand how these systems work, and what advantages and disadvantages exist as well as to understand what awaits us in the future in the pharmaceutical field through the analysis of a real example. A personal interview was performed, in January 2018, with the owner and director of the Giro pharmacy; a session of passive observation was also realized. The aim was to learn about and observe the implementation of an automated system for the distribution of products from storage. The advantage of the system is that it allows for a more personalized service, as the employee does not need to be absent at any time during the delivery of the service. Innovation and its source was also a topic during the interview. International contacts and observing how firms function in other countries which are technologically more advanced (e.g. in Germany) were revealed as being important.
