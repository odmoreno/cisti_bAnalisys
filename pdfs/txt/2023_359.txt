Aspects for the creation of learning communities in university research centers
ABSTRACT
This research aims to identify the most relevant aspects that are required for the creation of learning communities in research centers of a higher education institution. Methodologically, it was developed under the positivist paradigm, with a quantitative approach, the design is non-experimental and cross-sectional. The information was collected through a self-created questionnaire applied to 247 professors-researchers working in fifteen academic units. The findings show that professor-researchers perceive a level below the average in two of the six categories analyzed, which implies greater attention to the indicators of Quality and Leadership. Likewise, according to the results of this research, the aspects with more presence for the creation of learning communities in research centers of a higher education institution are Collaborative work, Interactive groups, Dialogic learning, and Authentic Evaluation. Therefore, the results will be especially useful to make decisions, establishing strategies, and set up actions to strengthen the areas of opportunity identified in the research.
