Application of gamification elements in software engineering teamwork
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, gamification elements have been applied beyond of traditional games that we know, an example is their application in academic area in software engineering, where them have been supported the students' learning and the accomplishment of activities in projects. In this context, gamification elements have been applied in very few investigation studies to improve the integration of team work members. Thus, is important to identify which is the impact of the gamification elements in teamwork.
