Art State of Retro Marketing in the Modern Times
ABSTRACT
In the competitive days in which we live, it is very easy for big brands to decline, which leads to a drop in sales and a loss of the ability of brands to be spontaneously evoked in the minds of consumers, which can even lead to the exit of the market. The situation presented leads the brands to look for cheaper and safer ways to launch/sell their products. Hence the expression retro, which means that different products, services, and brands, which were used in the past, return to the present again. The success of these retro products and brands with consumers can be explained by their differentiation, by the evocation of the authentic or by a period in which things were made to last, or even by more nostalgic propensities that are felt above all in a turbulent context like the current one. The purpose of this study is to describe the different categories of retromarketing proposed in the literature, not forgetting the many examples of industries that have adopted this strategy.
