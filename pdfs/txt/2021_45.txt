Ensuring Traceability on Management of IT Infrastructures : Orchestrator based on a Distributed Ledger
ABSTRACT
To support new and more complex software systems, tools, and applications, the IT Infrastructures have evolved to be more flexible and grow both in size and complexity. To manage those Infrastructures, several tools are used. For large datacenters and public cloud infrastructures, complex managements systems have been developed in-house, according to specific implementations and philosophies. However, for the small, business owned, infrastructures, such tools are usually used independently. In this paper, we present the architecture of a new Orchestrator tool that aims to provide a single point of management, while also maintaining a resource inventory, by means of a Distributed Ledger, in order to maintain records of all the changes in the infrastructure, ensuring traceability over past changes, and even allowing for rollback of certain actions.
