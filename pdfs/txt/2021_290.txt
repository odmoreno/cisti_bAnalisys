Journalistsâ€™ perspectives about news-making strategies and the relationship with brands
ABSTRACT
This work aims a better understanding of the relationship between journalists, brand managers, public relations and press officers. A controversial subject from long time [1][2][3][4][5]. Based on qualitative methodology, the main objective of this exploratory research is to understand the relationship between media and brands. There is a new context where traditional media are questioned about their significance for brands and consumers and are being pressured by the emergence of new gatekeepers, such as digital influencers. We focus on the scrutiny of two semi-structured face to face interviews with journalists who write about the automotive industry. At the end, the information is examined according to the literature about brand management, public relations, media relations and new consumer influence dynamics. Studying the strategies, interests, and narratives from media with brands, this research tries to deliver insights about the specific nature of the information preferred by journalists during the news-making process, how they perceive the relationship with press officers and how they evaluate the influence of their work on consumers' / readers' behavior.
