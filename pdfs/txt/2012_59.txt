Persistence framework for Object-Relational Database
ABSTRACT
Persistent Frameworks have been used to aid developers, managing all access to DBMS. This kind of tool maps objects from OO applications to relational databases. Besides, allow developers to persist objects without solid knowledge about DBMSs and specific languages, making better the developers' productivity, mainly when different DBMS is used. On the other hands, since 1999 the SQL specification has introduced new features to manipulate objects in relational databases which since then has been called Object-Relational Database (ORDB). At present, many DBMS offer resources to manipulate objects in database, but the most of the application developers just map class to relations tables, failing to exploit the strength of O-R model. The lack of the tools that aid the project of database contributes to this situation. Considering the vantages of use of the persistent frameworks and the ORDBs, this article introduces the O-ODM (Object-Object Database Mapping) a persistent framework for relational object databases.
