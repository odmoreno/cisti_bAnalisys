Making the informal learning activities support the formative assessment process in CSCL environments
ABSTRACT
This work is about an ongoing research that has the objective of developing a service that captures the informal learning activities from the PLE so it can aid the formative assessment process in formal collaborative environments, such as the LMS. This investigation counted on the participation of 49 apprentices of distance-learning courses from different institutions in Brazil. Through the results, it was possible to understand how the informal activities can help teachers conduct courses or existing subjects in the LMS. The results also allowed the specification of requirements to conceive and generation the prototypes of the service. At the moment, the research is centered in the alignment of the integration of the functionalities of the selected LMS in the research with the proposed functionalities for the service, as well as in the evaluation process of the prototypes.
