AASI: Sensor Activation Algorithm with Interaction for Low-Cost Microcontrollers
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things assists in remote patient monitoring, bringing healthcare benefits. Monitoring can involve multiple sensors, such as heart rate and blood oxygenation sensors. However, it is a challenge to guarantee accurate and real-time readings on low-cost microcontrollers. This work proposes a solution that manages several sensors in low-cost microcontrollers, guaranteeing the accuracy of the readings and reducing the time of anomaly detection and decision-making. The experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm guarantees the accuracy of the readings and reduces the time of anomaly detection and decision-making.
