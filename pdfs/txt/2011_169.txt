Generic Interface for Developing Abstract Strategy Games
ABSTRACT
The aim of this paper is to describe the research, planning and development stages for the project entitled “Generic Interface for Developing Abstract Strategy Games”. The project consists in the development of a generic platform capable of creating any kind of abstract strategy game, and is essentially divided in three phases: research on related topics, design and specification and lastly the development of a working prototype. Through the analysis of similarities between game mechanics this project intends to define abstract games in a generic fashion, as well as enabling users to easily define their own games, ultimately allowing for the creation of a working prototype. The prototype is a software tool that allows users to create several distinct abstract games through a series of options, which define the games' rules. This project opens up the possibility to easily create and test games, without the need to program them. It represents a step forward in abstract game creation and can be a catalyst to Artificial Intelligence research, by allowing rapid testing of perfect information game puzzles ideal for Artificial Intelligence search algorithms.
