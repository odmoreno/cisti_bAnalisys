Implementing interoperability in a Brazilian seismic event database
ABSTRACT
Since decisions are based on information, it is essential for any manager to have quick and convenient access to accurate and updated information. The Seismological Observatory of the University de Brasilia (UnB) owns and operates WebSISBRA, a GIS database for Brazilian seismic events data. The flow of accurate and updated information from and to this system relies on interoperability with other systems. This paper describes an interoperability layer implemented for WebSISBRA with WFS and WMS services provided by the GeoServer Software, allowing web users to access WebSISBRA data in a transparent manner that can be configured for either data analysis and modeling, or data visualization.
