Improvements in web tools for collective works and debates applied to learning
ABSTRACT
Debates and collective work have been a classic teaching resource. However, both lose effectiveness as the number of students raises. In debates, participation declines, since only one student can speak at once. In collective work coordination becomes complicated. ICTs offer solutions to these problems. This work is based just in a software application that allows discussion and group work, so that students are free to contribute in any aspect, without constraints on who takes the floor or hierarchies. The system is self-structured, so it does not require the teacher to guide them. Group collaboration helps maintain orderly progress. The result of the experience of using this tool in different engineering courses and its improvements are also presented.
