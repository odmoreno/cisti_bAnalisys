LMS accessibility for students with disabilities: The expertsâ€™ opinions
ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the accessibility of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) for higher education students with disabilities. Evidence was collected by using a focus group methodology. Main findings are that there is no single solution that can fit all individual needs, even when the same type of disability is at stake; that, consequently, the use of external tools adapted to specific special needs is preferable to the development of embedded facilities; and that special attention should be given to accessibility of the content uploaded to the LMS. Twelve experts participated in the focus group, including elements with experience in managing LMSs, experience in supporting disabled students, and experience in research projects on the subject.
