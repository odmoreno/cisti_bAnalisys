Potencial digital femenino en el mercado laboral : Female digital potential in labor market
ABSTRACT
The role of women in labor market has been widely studied. However, the analysis based on ICT access among women is an issue that requires attention in a digitized world, in which inequalities persist against it. This research proposes to highlight the differences in the possibility of participating in the Ecuadorian labor market between women who have access to ICT (computer and Internet) compared to those who do not have access. The methodology used is a probabilistic binary variable model that assumes a logistic distribution function of stochastic disturbances. The results show significant differences in favor of women who have access to ICT. With these findings, the debate for research to promote concrete proposals for reducing digital gaps between women in developing economies such as Ecuador is strengthened.
