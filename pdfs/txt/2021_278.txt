Using a Computer-Based Program to Treat Neurocognitive Deficit Disorders in Spanish Population
ABSTRACT
Neuropsychological evaluation is an important factor in the treatment of cognitive impairment in people with mental disorders. The main objective of our paper is to show an evaluation of Gradior computer-based program, in terms of usability and satisfaction degree standards, for the treatment of neurocognitive deficits. The "Satisfaction Evaluation of the Gradior centers" questionnaire was used to measure the usability and satisfaction of the program. This research includes a multi-method analysis of information, through combination of quantitative and qualitative strategies. The evaluation made to the Gradior program by 56 professionals from different centers indicates that the tool is very useful and effective in the treatment of cognitive deficiencies. The application of factorial analysis to the questionnaire shows that are 5 factors that exceed a percentage of explained variance of 5% and with an eigenvalue higher than 2, which was considered a factor with sufficient clinical significance, hence the α value of Cronbach’s obtained in reliability study is 0.913, which shows that applied questionnaire has good reliability. In general terms, the program is satisfactory, its management and use is adequate, and it allows seeing implementation capacity in clinical environments, this being one of few studies that show this subject in field of cognitive rehabilitation.
