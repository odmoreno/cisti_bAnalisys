Crowdfunding: A funding model that succeeds in times of revolt of the masses
ABSTRACT
The decisive political and economic modifications operated at a global level added to the accelerated digitization process in which modern society lives originate the construction of a new ecosystem in which the organized masses have a fundamental role. This process of change invites reflection on the new collaborative trends that emerge within a rebellious society that doesn't find economic support neither from the banks nor from institutional organizations. The hyperconnectivity that digital tools provide has done nothing but reinforce these trends and crowdfunding is one of the tools that has become prominent. This system of collective funding is constantly growing and its strength lies in that its usefulness comes from millions of people around the world, organized in virtual communities through social networks and platforms specialized in this formula that are themselves a social network. Social causes, business projects and cultural products have understood this new reality in which a prominent role is conferred, on the one hand to the entrepreneur who advocates masification and participation, and secondly, to an ever more active, autonomous, participative, committed and demanding user. Pending a regulatory framework that addresses the diversity and heterogeneity of campaigns funded through this strategy, crowdfunding can be very close to reaching its full potential.
