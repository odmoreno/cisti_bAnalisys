Model of crisis management in social media â€” Suggestion for the health sector
ABSTRACT
Social media have assumed a major part in people's daily life, nowadays we are all web content producers, thus situations that are uncomfortable and stressful can be shared a lot easier than a few years ago. This new interaction in social media brings daily consequences for business. Situations that were contained, now can assume a large scale and damage institutions' image and reputation. Recently there have been a commitment of the companies to invest in tools to monitor social media so that potential crises can be prevent. Health institutions, such as hospitals, have not yet showed concern with this problem. Many of them do not have communication staff, have limited resources and many of the executive directors in hospitals are not aware that social media monitoring is needed. It is necessary to create a set of simple and affordable tools that help these institutions to prevent potential crisis.
