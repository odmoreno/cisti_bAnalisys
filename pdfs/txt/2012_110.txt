Teaching evaluation using Augmented Reality in architecture: Methodological proposal
ABSTRACT
Incorporation of new technologies in university studies is a consummate factor. However, it is necessary to evaluate the degree of satisfaction, need and interest that the use of these technologies can provide both in the training of the student and their perception regarding the use of the technology. In this paper, we present a new proposal for evaluating the implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) in the architecture degree based on an accurate review of the state of the art regarding educational evaluations and their statistical analyses. The main objective of this paper was to design a test model that reflects the student profiles and their satisfaction and adaptation degree with the specific technology used in different educational frameworks.
