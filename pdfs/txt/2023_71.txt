Implementation of a Video Game to guide the user interactively in a 3D virtual environment.
ABSTRACT
The use of interactive virtual environments to allow users to learn about and become familiar with specific locations can be enhanced by adding video game elements to increase motivation and guide exploration of the virtual environment. This paper describes the implementation of a video game with a guide avatar integrated into a pre-existing virtual environment to guide exploration in an interactive way within the UTPL 3D virtual campus, avoiding disorientation and eventual loss of interest in visiting the different places of the campus, also determining its usability in terms of ease of interaction. The development methodology for educational video games was used, which includes the phases of: initiation, design, production and testing. The result of the work was a video game and a guide avatar fully integrated in the virtual environment, which motivate the exploration of the environment, authenticate the usersâ€™ access and record their progress. White box and black box tests were performed on several versions of the video game code to optimize the code and verify the correct functioning of the system. The usability tests (SUS model) involved 24 people (students and teachers, and users from outside the institution) who used the video game. The responses obtained allowed determining a score of 76.25/100, which places it at an acceptable level.
