Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum Simulation for Bluetooth Using Matlab
ABSTRACT
The present research was carried out with the purpose of developing a graphical interface simulation model for the transmission of modulated Bluetooth signal under the frequency hopping spread spectrum scheme, based on MATLAB. It was conceived to simulate frequency hopping by transmitting certain information graphically, in which the user can enter the information to be transmitted in binary format and choose the type of pseudo code for the hopping sequence that must be the same in both the transmitter and receiver to read the information and obtain the original message after performing the demodulation in the receiver. Three different practices were planned, and their respective procedure guides were elaborated as didactic material. The first one was intended to familiarize telecommunications students with the graphical interface of frequency hopping spread spectrum simulation with the definition of the required parameters and technical conditions. The second was aimed at sending and visualizing the information with the possibility of varying the sequence code that follows the carrier hopping. Finally, with the third practice it was possible to analyze the errors and synchronization failures of the pseudo code for the hopping sequence. The application was developed in MATLAB, which allowed handling matrix calculations, creation of specific functions and the development of a graphical interface easy to operate, for the simulation of Bluetooth signal transmission with frequency hopping spread spectrum.
