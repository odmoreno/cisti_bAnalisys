Customized learning environment: A new approach
ABSTRACT
The education sector is going through a very marked change in relation to the needs of students who arrive at Higher Institutions Education (HIEs), and the labor market requirements. There are already solutions that try to meet the new requirements; however, the changing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) require a rapid and demanding adaptation. In this context it is assumed that education systems must address the backgrounds diversity of students, taking into account their need in order to provide access to learning objects, as well as the validation of knowledge of each student. In this paper, we propose a model where all the learning and e-learning elements are present and where the student is the focus and the one who decides what should be included in this learning environment in order to create a Customized Learning Environment.
