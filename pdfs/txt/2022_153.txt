Digital authoring tools to create educational resources : An analysis framework sustained by a benchmarking research
ABSTRACT
Technological development and ubiquity prompted a shift in the users’ behaviors. More than just consumers, users now become prosumers. Following this trend, teachers, adapting to new technologies, simultaneously start to use those means to be the digital creators of their own educational resources. Notwithstanding, teachers have specific requirements due to their eventual lack of technical and artistic skills, enhancing the relevance of designing digital artifacts that meet teachers’ needs, combining Usability and usefulness.In this paper, following an analysis of five tools that aim the creation of digital educational resources, a framework to analyze such tools and to aid further development of these kinds of tools is proposed.
