Survey on Job Scheduling in Cloud-Fog Architecture
ABSTRACT
Application execution required in cloud and fog architectures are generally heterogeneous in terms of device and application contexts. Scaling these requirements on these architectures is an optimization problem with multiple restrictions. Despite countless efforts, task scheduling in these architectures continue to present some enticing challenges that lead us to question how tasks are routed between different physical devices, fog nodes and cloud. In fog, due to its density and heterogeneity of devices, the scheduling is very complex and, in the literature, there are still few studies that have been conducted. However, scheduling in the cloud has been widely studied. Nonetheless, many surveys address this issue from the perspective of service providers or optimize application quality of service (QoS) levels. Also, they ignore contextual information at the level of the device and end users and their user experiences. In this paper, we conducted a review of the literature on the main task scheduling algorithms in cloud and fog architecture; we studied and discussed their limitations, and we also explored and suggested some perspectives for improvement.
