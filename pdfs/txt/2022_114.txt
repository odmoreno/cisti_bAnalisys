Readability of Graphical Contents on World Wide Web (WWW)
ABSTRACT
the growth of the Web has been exponential over the last decade. Graphical contents are usually more effective than just the written text in web readability because people hardly have time to sit down and read anything lengthy anymore. However, irrelevant or bad-quality graphical content on the web contributes to poor readability, distracting the reader from the focus of the reading. The main aim of this research is to make images on the Web more readable to people. For this, we will analyze the factors that affect the readability of graphical contents on the web, propose a new measure to automatically calculate the relevance of the graphical contents, and finally design the guidelines to improve the readability of graphical contents on the web. User studies will be performed and the findings will be used to devise guidelines that web designers can use to improve the readability of their web pages.
