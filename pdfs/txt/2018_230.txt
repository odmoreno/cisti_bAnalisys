Transmedia literacy and its repercussions on the academic use of the Internet
ABSTRACT
The concentration and effort being focused on the use of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in the teaching and learning process ignores the commercial nature of built-in tools, and the effects of marketing and technological conditioning on students who use those tools are unknown. We analyze the technological factors that limit students' use of the Internet for educational purposes through phenomenological and methodological review. We identify forms of technological conditioning for commercial intent that affect educational use of the Internet. We also examine how learning and the informal use of the Internet affects the way in which educational tasks are solved, and as a result, how ICT is implemented in teaching.
