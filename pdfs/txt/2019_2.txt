Constructive scheme of academic texts: Algorithm to discover the main object, its characteristics and functions
ABSTRACT
This article describes the algorithm that shows the structure of texts, scientific or academic articles, from the theme, characteristics and actions. The first step of the algorithm is to identify all subheadings or large groups found, such as introduction, methodology, result, discussions, conclusion. With the groups identified, the next step is to find all the grammatical periods, which will be analyzed so that groups capable of describing actions and formulas can be located and assembled. Since the text, in the semantic sense, is a seam or an interlacing of words that forms a sense of information that does not obey a rule, a sequence or an algorithm of thought, it becomes necessary to standardize the description of the characteristics of the theme. In this process step, with the rules standardized and reorganized according to the algorithm, any article will be treated as if it were a computational structure, since this is one of the means to know what actions or functions the article describes, and that will be rewritten in the schema: object, property, modules and functions.
