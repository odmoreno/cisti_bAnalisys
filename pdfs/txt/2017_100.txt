Study of barriers to contribute with Brazilian public software projects
ABSTRACT
Brazilian public software projects are based on the principles and characteristics of free and open source software projects such as security, collaborative development models, technological independence, audibility, and free licenses. In this work, we try to understand the difficulty to start to contribute with a Brazilian public software via its development process and rules for this kind of projects. This paper aims to verify the barriers already proposed in the literature and investigates specific barriers in the context of Brazilian public software projects. For that, we performed a research with Brazilian public software communities and we elaborate a new model of barriers to contribute with Brazilian public software projects.
