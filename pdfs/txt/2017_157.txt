The integration of the Edmodo platform in the teaching of ICT: Proposal of activities for the adult education and training courses
ABSTRACT
Here, we present and discuss a proposal of activities for the teaching of ICT, using the web-based platform Edmodo, to be developed within the framework of Adult Education and Training courses. It is based on the experience gained in the teaching of this type of course throughout the academic year of 2015/2016, in a school of the District of Vila Real, Portugal. We also present the framework that supports this proposal in the three dimensions involved: pedagogical, technological and legal.
