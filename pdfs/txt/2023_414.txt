The Impact of User-Generated Content in Shaping the Image of Tourist Destination Across Different Generations
ABSTRACT
The rise of social media and online review platforms has given travelers a platform to share their experiences and opinions about destinations, accommodations, and attractions which can influence the perception of a destination among potential visitors. The paper suggests a framework for future empirical research that considers different generations as a moderator variable between User-Generated Content (UGC) and the image of tourist destinations. This is based on the idea that different generations have different preferences, expectations, and attitudes toward travel, which can influence how they perceive and react to UGC. Overall, this paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the impact of UGC on the tourism industry. By proposing a model that considers generational differences, it highlights the importance of understanding the diverse preferences and attitudes of travelers in shaping the image of tourist destinations.
