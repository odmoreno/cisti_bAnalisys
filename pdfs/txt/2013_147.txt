Identification and ranking of relevant criteria for the selection of Software as a Service
ABSTRACT
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model for the provision of application software that allows them to be seen as a service rather than a product. A main challenge for organizations is to understand which applications in their portfolio are more appropriate to deploy in this way. This paper proposes an approach based on the Delphi method to identify and rank the relevant criteria for the selection of applications. The results show that the Delphi method is a flexible tool that allows the expansion of knowledge, by identifying relevant criteria to the problem not foreseen by the researcher, and by providing a ranking of importance of those criteria.
