Metaverse: technology landscape of patent informations
ABSTRACT
Technically, the metaverse is a shared virtual collective space created by converging virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. As a combinatorial innovation, multiple technologies and trends are required, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, the internet of things, 5G, and artificial intelligence. The objective of this paper is to present a landscape of the technologies registered in patent documents using the R Bibliometrix package to explore the metadata retrieved in the research. The methodology of this work comprises the data collection, detailing how the study was carried out, and the analysis of the patent metadata using the R-Bibliometrix package. The technology landscape contained the performance and technological structure analyses. The performance indicators identified patents by jurisdiction and top applicants. The technological structure presented the following topics: the most frequent words and CPC/subclass codes; trend topics; thematic map and evolution of the CPC/group codes. The conclusion highlights the use of R-Bibliometrix for the development of a technological landscape.
