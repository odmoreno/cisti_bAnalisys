Usersâ€™ training as an impact factor in the data quality in Business Analytics
ABSTRACT
The amount of information that companies have is increasing exponentially and just having the data is no longer enough. It is necessary to transform them into knowledge, using applications and techniques to gather, analyze and store them efficiently. It is then observed the importance of data quality, which is directly associated with the improvement of the people working in the process, so that the users' objective is the same as expected for strategic decisions. The objective of this literature review is to demonstrate that the training of those who have direct contact with the data, initially, is an indispensable factor for them to understand and exercise the role of mediators in the way data is collected, processed and destined. This is because this initial reception of data directly impacts the performance of business planning and shows the maturity level of this planning in a context of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics.
