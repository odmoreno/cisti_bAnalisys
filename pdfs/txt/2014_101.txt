New educational technologies and learning evaluation: A challenge presented to education
ABSTRACT
With the increasing integration of digital technologies in everyday practice of classroom, learning evaluation gained contours of challenge. Education with technological mediation invites us to practice and continuous training, contextualized assessment, flexible and interactive, stimulating dialogue between teachers and students. The evaluation process would be simplified if we sought more support technologies, little used in assessment practices. We present results of a survey conducted with 55 teachers / tutors of a course held in blended learning mode, with intense technological mediation, in Rio de Janeiro. In the questionnaire we asked the "evaluation procedures used" Was cited for a variety of important evaluative formative assessment strategies such as problem solving, games and concept maps, but received little mention. We consider positive the reference to portfolios, projects and forums. In the second category of research analysis chosen, "experiences with the evaluation" was nice to realize that references to positive experiences to overcome the negative review. In both cases the results appeared as a major factor. The positive references were frequent mentions of satisfaction with the work done and the observation of student progress. The negative aspects we quote the fact that the evaluation be arduous and repetitive process, as well as the complexity of the type of education with the mediation of digital technologies bring to the evaluation. We observed that the training teacher courses insufficiently address the evaluation of learning and the difficulties with the same can be minimized if it is shared with the students own their learning through clear and built together teaching contracts, in which both parties involved in the processes of teaching and learning be liable jointly, each with their skills.
