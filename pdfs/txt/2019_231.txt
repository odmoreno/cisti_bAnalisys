The Role of Trust in the Sharing Economy
ABSTRACT
The sharing economy, which is based on the exchange, sale, donation or rental of products and services among strangers, raises questions about the security, privacy and motivations of users regarding interpersonal trust and platforms. In this context, this study aims to analyze the scientific production about the thematic trust in the sharing economy through bibliometric techniques. For this purpose, a search of the Scopus platform was carried out, which initially resulted in 145 publications, in later phases these studies were selected and analyzed with the aid of software. The bibliometric analysis allowed us to explore the literature about trust in the sharing economy between the years 2013 to 2018. The findings were categorized into annual publication of articles, origin and quantity of publications, methodological nature, instruments and techniques of data collection, association between authors by affiliation countries, occurrence of keywords and referenced authors to conceptualize the sharing economy. By considering the sharing economy a recent and changing subject, this mapping elucidates the advancement of publications and identifies the current research scenario. For future studies, it is suggested to analyze the various platforms based on topics such as familiarity, perceived risk, security, privacy and interaction and design in the digital platforms of the sharing economy.
