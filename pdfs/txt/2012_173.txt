DEVELOP-FPS: A First Person Shooter development tool for rule-based scripts
ABSTRACT
We present DEVELOP-FPS, a software tool specially designed for the development of First Person Shooter (FPS) players controlled by Rule Based Scripts. DEVELOP-FPS may be used by FPS developers to create, debug, maintain and compare rule base player behaviours, providing a set of useful functionalities: i) for an easy preparation of the right scenarios for game debugging and testing; ii) for controlling the game execution: users can stop and resume the game execution at any instant, monitoring and controlling every player in the game, monitoring the state of each player, their rule base activation, being able to issue commands to control their behaviour; and iii) to automatically run a certain number of game executions and collect data in order to evaluate and compare the players performance along a sufficient number of similar experiments.
