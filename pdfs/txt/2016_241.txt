Quality of life assessment: Estimation based on Rasch model
ABSTRACT
Continuous assessment of the quality of health-related life (HRQoL) of patients is an important aspect of health and gives rise to several readings. On one hand, the enormous amount of information that is generated allows the extraction of knowledge with great accuracy concerning the disease, the treatments and the impact it has on society, on the other hand, this continuous monitoring allows effective control and one timely intervention on the patient. The QoLIS platform has a set of characteristics advantageous over other, including the wide range of analyses that can be made from the results that it provides. However, the complexity of the calculus evolved on the models used, combined with the number of data processing, hamper its use in real time, hindering their use in the context of a medical appointment. Whereas the use of evaluation of quality of life (QoL) in the context of a appointment is an added value for everyone involved, it was necessary to develop and implement, on the QoLIS, a strategy for determining the value of QoL, by estimate, based on Rasch model (in order to provide the same set of responses) and whose response time allows its effective use.
