Training primary caregivers of dependent people through the use of ICT
ABSTRACT
Life expectancy has increased in most industrialized countries and the number of older adults is projected to grow. Older people have a high prevalence of chronic mental and physical Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (E.g. diabetes, osteoarthritis, heart failure, Alzheimer and Parkinson) with functional implications that lead to dependency. Thus, older people will require sometimes long-time interventions although not necessarily permanent from caregivers. A web-solution aimed to primary caregivers is here presented-that can be available from every place and time-to manage dependent people and/or elderly dependent.
