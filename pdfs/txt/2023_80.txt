Educational Flexibility and its impact on the Hybrid Modality
ABSTRACT
the digital transformation has generated unprecedented changes worldwide, in this sense; the education sector has undergone significant changes in the way in which technology-mediated curricular content is offered, hence the importance of analyzing the role of technology. educational flexibility in the hybrid education model, particularly in the post-pandemic stage in university students, precisely, one of the effects after the confinement by COVID-19 has been the incorporation of new methodologies to education, which are mediated by the technology, where the acquisition and transmission of knowledge have been adapted to meet training needs at the higher level.The impact of educational flexibility in hybrid education is evaluated in business administration undergraduate students. Young people between the ages of 17 and 23 from the Faculty of Accounting and Administration of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexico, are taken as a study sample.Data processing is carried out using a correlational model of structural equations under the principal component rotation method, to define the degree of regression between the independent variable (Educational Flexibility) with respect to the dependent variable (Hybrid Education).The AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) software is used, which allows the design and validation of a structural statistical model that defines and identifies goodness-of-fit coefficients of the predictive investigative model, derived from the theoretical analysis, to estimate the hypotheses that support the results as a structural model, which helps to determine the degree of involvement of variables.The results show the preference of the students for the educational offer in hybrid modality over the face-to-face modality since it broadens the academic offer, their intellectual possibilities to achieve a better standard of living, therefore educational flexibility has a fundamental role in the adoption of educational modalities in hybrid format.
