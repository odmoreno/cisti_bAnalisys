Universal Observatory of Projects: Initial Studies
ABSTRACT
In the face of technological expansion, tools are needed to enable efficient data management and observation. Observatories are built for a variety of purposes and fit together as a useful and necessary tool to synthesize data, information and knowledge. The objective of this work is to propose initial studies for the construction of the Universal Observatory of Projects. For this, three exploratory studies were carried out. The results of this research show evidence that the construction of project observatories is feasible and that it can provide benefits to projects and their management.
