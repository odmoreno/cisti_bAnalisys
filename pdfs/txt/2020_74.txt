ABSTRACT
The performance evaluation of university professors in Portugal has not been updated for over 40 years. This study intends to present a new aspect to the model, Characteristics Assessment, centered on the concept of competence management. The strand is organized in two dimensions of analysis: Skills and Entrepreneurship. The MISC Model (Monitoring Indicators for Successful Carrer) is aimed at three business actors (target audience), teacher, in monitoring the skills of the teacher their professional activities in the organization, student, in collecting their feedback after the end of the class, and market, collection of feedback from companies in order to value the performance of the teacher in the entrepreneurship dimension. Our intention is that the MISC is an assessment tool with the aim of informing the organization about the performance of its talents, the teachers in achieving the goals established by the organization, and on the other hand informing the teachers about their professional performance on the day daily in order to enhance their performance and thereby enhance their personal brand in the organization.
