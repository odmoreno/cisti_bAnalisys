Proposition of Computational Methods and Techniques for the Study of Academic Mobility
ABSTRACT
The exodus of individuals for various reasons or circumstances has increased significantly over the last few years in the Brazilian and world scenario. One of the reasons identified for this migratory flow is the academic training of these individuals, who seek to train in higher quality educational institutions. In this context, this work aims to analyze how the scientific exodus occurs in Brazil, in which individuals from different parts of the country migrate in search of better academic training. Therefore, in this study, it was analyzed how the Brazilian scientific exodus occurs. For this, it was necessary to extract academic training data from the curricula of individuals registered on the Lattes Platform. Therefore, all individuals with a completed doctorate were selected, aggregating 308,317 curricula. Initially, the data was filtered, selecting the attributes relevant to the research, and finally, the data processing was carried out in order to find the geographic location of the institutions in which the individuals were trained. As initial results, it was possible to characterize the data collected on the Lattes Platform, measuring the distances covered by individuals throughout their academic training. Link networks were made demonstrating the main locations occupied by doctors during their academic training, as well as the connections between these locations. Thus, it was possible to present an unprecedented portrait of how the Brazilian scientific exodus occurs.
