Motivations for Visiting Peri-urban Natural Areas
ABSTRACT
In the 21st century, tourism has become one of the most dynamic and fastest growing economic sectors in the world, being considered a decisive driver in job creation and local and regional economic development. In Portugal, this is, also, a reality. Additionally, sustainable tourism and protected areas can contribute with public benefits towards a better common future. This paper aims to identify visitor≈õ motivations for a Portuguese protected area (PPA), the Vale do Tua Regional Natural Park (PNRVT). Data were collected through a questionnaire, with 395 respondents. From those, only 100 (34.7%) respondents indicated that they had already visited the PNRVT and were considered for the evaluation of motivations of this protected area. The data obtained were analyzed using Jamovi statistical program, using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that visitors of PNRVT aim to learn/expand their knowledge and see a specific place.
