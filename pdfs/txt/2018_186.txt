Exploring sustainability from the software quality model perspective
ABSTRACT
Supporting sustainable development goals have become a research topic in software engineering community. Although several models and frameworks propose sustainability definitions, sustainability meaning is still emerging. Given that sustainability can be studied as a nonfunctional requirement or a quality attribute, this paper aims at exploring the sustainability concept from the software quality perspective based on approaches for classifying quality models. As a work in progress, the proposed classification scheme was piloted with papers gathered from a previously published literature review about sustainability and software quality. As a result, the classification scheme allows identifying purpose, domain, number of quality-related terms, sustainability dimensions, among others. However, other aspects, such as categorizing analysis models and validation approaches, might improve the classification scheme.
