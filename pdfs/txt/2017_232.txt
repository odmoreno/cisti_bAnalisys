Mobile application for stress assessment
ABSTRACT
The use of information and communication technologies, mobile devices and wearable devices have had great growth in recent years. Chronic stress is a disease that affects millions of individuals and has a great growth with enormous economic and social impact. Prevention in this area of health is, increasingly, a fundamental aspect for the improvement of the quality of life of each one and the public health in general. The objective of the present study is to understand how stress can be continuously monitored, especially in individuals who perform occupations that present a high risk of stress, in order to predict and alert the occurrence of chronic or pathological stress and burnout situations. For this purpose a non-invasive measurement instrument will be developed for the individual using biometric signals, measured through a wearable device, collected in a mobile device and later sent to an information system that will handle this information. In the experiment carried out, a prototype of a mobile application was developed that synchronizes the data coming from smartbands directly linked to the individuals with smartphones, to continuously monitor the physical and quality of life related to the health of the person. Of course, data collection is only of importance if the data are analyzed with consequent production of results for the individual and health professionals. Some technologies normally used to elaborate a system of this magnitude will also be analyzed and, with the support of the health professionals and individuals for whom the evaluation is intended, various forms of feedback on stress levels will be evaluated in order to develop a set of Dashboards with information of stress, distinguishing the information destined to the professional of health of that made available to the own individual.
