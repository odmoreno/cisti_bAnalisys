“A Priest in the Air”
ABSTRACT
Modern society is witnessing an increase in average life expectancy. Nowadays, stroke represents one of the major causes of disabilities worldwide usually among older adults. The stroke is a type of cerebrovascular accident that may cause motricity and cognitive impairments. The recovery process usually lacks a patient-centric strategy, relying on a set of long, painful and difficult physiotherapy sessions. At the same time, the lack of resources from health services and the lack of engagement by patients may lead to an incomplete recovery training program. This research presents the game design process and evaluation of a digital game in two immersive environment displays (Monitor and Head Mounted Display, both with a Leap Motion Controller). “A Priest in the Air“ intends to complement the traditional stroke recovery program with a digital game for the mid/final stage of the upper-limb motor function rehabilitation.
