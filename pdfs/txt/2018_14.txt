Uses of internet and levels of plagiarism
ABSTRACT
In this work, the level of incidence of the use of technologies on the level of plagiarism of university students is determined. A sample of 10,952 students from 31 universities in Ecuador was created. Students were classified based on experience, level of interaction and the use they give technology for academic activities. The results show that plagiarism tends to decrease as the student makes better use of technology for their academic activities.
