Spectral and spatial assessment of the Ikonos images fusion, using the Principal Components, Brovey Transform and Multiplicative
ABSTRACT
This article presents the assessment of the fusion of Ikonos satellite images using three methods, the first corresponds, Principal Component second Brovey Transform and the Multiplication method implemented in the Matlab Software, with the objective of identifying which of the three methods improves the special resolution without significant loss of spectral richness. Assessment of two implemented methods were performed using the following indices: ERGAS (spectral and spatial), RASE, Universal Quality Index Qu, and Correlation Index, where the best results on spatially and spectrally richness were obtained with first method called transform Brovey.
