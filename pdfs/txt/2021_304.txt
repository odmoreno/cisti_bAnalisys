Mobile application for Inclusive Tourism
ABSTRACT
Tourism is one of the most important economic sectors for Portugal and many countries in the world. With the emergence of low-cost aviation companies, this sector's growth has been exponential. Hence, operators, municipalities, and governments have to adapt to this new world order. A part of the world population that intends to visit has some type of disabilities. On the other hand, as the development of digital platforms, namely at the level of mobile devices, here opens many opportunities to be explored in this binomial between people with disabilities, their willingness to practice tourism, and the use of mobile devices for this purpose. This article intends to present a mobile application developed that allows the practice of inclusive tourism, using google maps and using an algorithm that helps classify the level of accessibility of each point of tourist interest. Finally, it allows the person with disabilities to know at the outset whether that point is inaccessible to its characteristics.
