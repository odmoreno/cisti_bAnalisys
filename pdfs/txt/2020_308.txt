A meta-model to develop learning ecosystems with support for knowledge discovery and decision-making processes
ABSTRACT
There are software solutions to solve most of the problems related to information management in any company or institutions, but still, there is a problem for transforming information into knowledge. Technological ecosystems emerge as a solution to combine existing tools and human resources to solve different problems of knowledge management. In particular, when the ecosystem is focused on learning processes associated with knowledge are named learning ecosystems. The learning ecosystem metamodel defined in previous works solves several problems related to the definition and implementation of these solutions. However, there are still challenges associated with improving the analysis and visualization of information as a way to discover knowledge and support decision making processes. On the other hand, there is a metamodel proposal to define customized dashboards for supporting decision-making processes. This proposal aims to integrate both metamodels as a way to improve the definition of learning ecosystems.
