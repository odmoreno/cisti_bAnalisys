Conceptualization of a support system for the mentally ill: A proposal for Portugal
ABSTRACT
Health has always been and always will be the mainstay of modern societies. From this axiomatic truth, the primary objective of this dissertation is focused on the analysis and specification of an information system that would allow better monitoring of the mentally ill. The approach to health in Portugal is still done in a stray without the necessary interaction of various health professionals on what is of paramount importance in health: the best interests of the patient. Given that, in contemporary societies, mental health has become all the more complex and troubling, with increasing prevalence. It is in our view essential to concentrate in creating sustainable alternatives, allowing not only the survival of the NHS, as well as the improvement of access to medicines and health services.
