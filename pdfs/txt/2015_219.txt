TV politics showed in Twitter: Media and followers
ABSTRACT
The aim of this work is to present an ongoing research relating to the use of Twitter by the media; a corpus of 3000 tweets from three TV politic shows are being analized (Los desayunos de TVE, in the public channel TVE1, and Las Ma√±anas Cuatro and Al Rojo Vivo, of private channels Cuatro and La Sexta) and a corpus of 1523 tweets responses produced by followers. The analysis model used is a neuropragmatic based linguistic model, that consider brands of subjectivity and interaction as a direct corollary of the theory of mind.
