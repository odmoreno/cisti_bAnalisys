Accessibility limitations of video conference tools for people with cognitive disabilities during COVID-19
ABSTRACT
COVID-19 outbreak has changed the learning paradigm towards a remote mode where video conferencing tools play a greater role. However, this approach presents accessibility issues for inclusive learning for people with cognitive disabilities. This study sought the experiences of relatives and autism spectrum disorder experts in using video conferencing tools for online learning throughout the pandemic. The data was collected through a survey and a thematic analysis was applied to identify the main accessibility factors that affected this group. Themes identified were: (i) complex UI (user interface), (ii) design for autonomy, and (iii) attention management. This study highlights the accessibility barriers of video tools for people on the spectrum and provide some suggestions to overcome them.
