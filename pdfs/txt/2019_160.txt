SimEmp — The Aplication of the PBL Methodology to Accounting Education
ABSTRACT
The requirements of the Certified Accountant (CC) profession are legally defined and the profession is recognized as being of public utility. The increasing challenges to which these professionals are subject have implied new requirements in terms of training, which are reflected in the training offered by Higher Education Institutions (HEI). In this sense, the SimEmp - Contabilidade web application is presented, which allows an approach to student-centered accounting teaching and “learning by doing”. This web-based computer application allows the use of active teaching methodologies based on Project Based Learning (PBL), and the students simulate a virtual business environment previously prepared for the acquisition of the skills and competencies that are required to these professionals in accounting, financial and tax. In addition, other characteristics of the students are put to the test, such as how they deal with stress, time management and teamwork.
