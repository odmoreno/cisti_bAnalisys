The use of Twitter by the prosecutors of Ecuador and Peru: Actors, links, and interaction
ABSTRACT
Magistrate’ use of social networks has been scarcely studied. It is assumed that the discretion of the jurisdictional function limits their interaction; but judges and prosecutors can be active Internet users in Latin America. This article analyzes the affiliation networks of the supreme prosecutors of Ecuador and Peru: based on the data generated by users (alteri) in their conversations, it assesses the role played by these magistrates (egos) in matters related to justice in their countries. Through the Social Network Analysis and Social Media Mining, the study poses the following questions: What topics led the conversations between egos and alteri? And what kinds of relationships did they build in their Twitter communities? It is concluded that, in the online world, egos become “political actors”, putting their delicate function at risk, to the detriment of transparency required by the administration of justice and respect among powers, a pillar of democracy.
