AllCall: An automated call for paper information extractor
ABSTRACT
The main objective of this paper is to describe a project named AllCall, created to help researchers organize their publication schedule. The technology herein presented intends to be able to automatically extract conference's relevant information - conference name, important dates, location, conference sites and topics - from emails and conveniently present it on a web interface. Differently from other tools, to the best of our knowledge no other application is able to do this sort of information extraction automatically. This paper reports on the first approach of the project and presents the results so far.
