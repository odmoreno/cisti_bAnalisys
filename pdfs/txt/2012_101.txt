Omnidirectional kick for a humanoid robot
ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a method to develop an omnidirectional kick (behavior) for a humanoid robot. This behavior uses a path planning module to create a trajectory that the foot must follow to propel the ball in the intended direction. Two additional modules were required when performing the movement: Inverse kinematics module which computes the value of the joints to position the foot at a given position and the stability module which is responsible for the robot's stability. Simulation tests are performed under different ball positions, relative to the robot's orientation, and for various ball directions. The results obtained showed the usefulness of the approach since the behavior performs accurately the intended motion and is able to kick the ball in all the directions desired.
