The Importance of Using the QR Code in Tourism in Portugal : The visitor’s perception of the city of Bragança
ABSTRACT
The main objective of this study was to investigate through the visitor's perception of the city of Bragança the adoption of QR Code technology and how much the tool can contribute to keep the local memory and culture alive. To this end, we opted for a quantitative research with exploratory descriptive analysis of the data, using a non-probabilistic sample with the application of a questionnaire survey, applied in that city in the months of October and November 2019. Through the empirical results obtained, it can be it is said that of the 250 respondents, 80.8% know the QR Code and 82.4% have used this technology.In general, visitors show a willingness to adopt the QR Code to value cultural goods and monuments by positively agreeing to use it for this purpose, despite the fact that the sample is less frequently used in tourist visits. It was found that the adoption of technologies in tourism can contribute to the local economy, increasing the number of visitors and allowing greater access to information, autonomy and social inclusion for people with disabilities. It was found that this tool of high impact and low cost of implementation is still little available to promote more access to cultural information, curiosities of the place, as well as to enhance cultural monuments in the city of Bragança.
