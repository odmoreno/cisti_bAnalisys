Context management infrastructure for intelligent-mobile-services execution environments
ABSTRACT
Mobile devices have become an excellent platform for the deployment of context-aware applications due to their market share rise, the permanent use we make of them and the great variety of sensors they come with. In this article we present a context management infrastructure whose task is to administer the context information in mobile environments with the aim of providing services that meet user needs. This way, we analyze the entities involved in the context management in this kind of environments and the requirements this infrastructure must comply with. Afterwards, the most relevant implementation aspects and the used technologies are detailed. Finally, in order to show the capabilities of the proposed solution, a use case is described.
