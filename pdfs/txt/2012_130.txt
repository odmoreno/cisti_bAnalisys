Video game interaction and reward mechanisms applied to business applications: A comparative review
ABSTRACT
Upon entering in a new institution, an employee has a learning curve to absorb new tools, this learning curve brings extra costs to the employing institution. Besides this, in 2008, a study from the National Institute of Statistics concluded that various Portuguese institutions have a low index of productivity. These two facts may make institutions feel more discouraged to make new hires. In this study we show that there is an unexplored potential in the adaptation of some of the gaming industry interaction and reward mechanisms to the corporate world, in order to improve the intuitiveness of business applications, by not only reducing learning and adjustment time for new users, but also to use the reward and fidelization mechanisms, as a means to motivate and increase overall productivity and employee involvement.
