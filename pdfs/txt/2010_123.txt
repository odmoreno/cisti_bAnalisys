The first steps of robotic cancan
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present our first steps taken for the development of a team of robots capable of executing a choreography. We have chosen one highly choreographed dance, the cancan, on which the dancers execute lots of different movements in a chorus-line. The choreography will be executed in real time synchronization with the music. A music analysis system is used to identify rhythmic events. These are sent to robots that react by executing dance movements. We describe two simple robotic dancing models, the Cockatoo and the Cancan Leg, which are our preliminary steps towards the development of a group of cancan robotic dancers.
