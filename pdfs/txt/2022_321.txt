Legal and technological aspects for the creation of a European Health Data Space
ABSTRACT
This paper presents review of the legal and technological topics surrounding the introduction of a European Health Data Space, currently under development. From the legal perspective, the limitations imposed by the GDPR are analysed, with a specific analysis on the privacy and anonymization issues, and question regarding the secondary use of data from existing health records are also approached. From the technological perspective, an analysis is made on how data should be governed and how data quality impacts the realization of the intended Data Space. As a conclusion, it is suggested a mechanism so that each person can define how and when its health data can be accessed and (re)used for secondary purposes.
