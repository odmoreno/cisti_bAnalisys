Allocation and migration of microservices in SDN-based vehicular fog networks
ABSTRACT
The increasing growth of the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) and the advent of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm, have enabled a wide variety of applications of intelligent transport systems (ITS). However, many applications demand low communication latency times, which makes it unfeasible to host them in cloud services. Many works use the Fog computing paradigm to address this problem, as it brings the cloud next to the vehicular nodes, but without considering its mobility. To respond to this reality, this work aims to use Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to improve the allocation and migration of microservices in Vehicular Fog Networks (VFN) taking into account the movement of vehicular nodes.
