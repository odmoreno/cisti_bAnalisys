Task allocation in Business Processes supported by BPMS: Optimization perspectives
ABSTRACT
By default, in the execution of processes supported by BPMS (Business Processes Management System) any task requiring human intervention is delivered to all the persons registered on the corresponding “role”. This article argues that in order to optimize the execution of work in organizations it is necessary to conciliate the characteristics of the tasks to be performed and the social and human aspects of the people who may perform them. In this sense the BPMS, while managing the execution of organizational processes, should be prepared to select the human resources which are more suitable to perform each task, taking into account their own characteristics, and those of the people who can accomplish them.
