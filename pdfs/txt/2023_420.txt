Intellectual Capital â€“ Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Companies around the world have come to realize the value of intellectual capital (IC) and its contribution to increasing the value of goods or services provided. Thus, this study aims to understand the existing information on IC, from the existing types of IC, its measurement, disclosure, reporting, what is its role in accounting, what is the green IC and what is its position in the Integrated Reporting. It is concluded that IC-based value creation is complicated, and more research is needed, and that the main difficulties faced during the integrated reporting process are due to the definition of materiality and the relationship of assets to this issue.
