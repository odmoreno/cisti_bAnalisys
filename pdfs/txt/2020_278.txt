The ICT and the teachers: m-learning as a modality used in teacher training
ABSTRACT
The impact of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on people's lives and, consequently, in almost all spaces frequented by the human beings, has brought new forms of communication and dissemination of information. The digital age has advanced, on a large scale, the knowledge society. Information is processed quickly for millions of people and it comes multifaceted by images, sounds and digital artefacts which provide interaction between the reader and the text. This reality has reached the classroom, which is stagnant in the face of new times. Here is a great discussion: how to teach and learn in the digital age? Therefore, this article aims to implement a teacher training model using the m-learning modality, anchored in digital skills for the use of dynamic technological resources in the classroom. This research will consist of a case study with a qualitative approach, validated by questionnaires that can be answered, via mobile devices. In this perspective, it is expected that teachers interact, through mobile learning, with some training content which will assist them in the use of ICT in the classroom.
