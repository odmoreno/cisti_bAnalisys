Forecasting of Energy Consumption : Artificial Intelligence Methods
ABSTRACT
Currently, energy consumption is one of the most important research areas in the world. The growing need to increase energy efficiency and improve the use of energy sources brings the need for better energy management and forecasting models. Therefore, forecasting energy consumption has become crucial for estimating energy consumption, as it provides both environmental and especially economic benefits. Forecasting is an integral part of business decision-making processes. The growing needs for greater energy efficiency and better use of energy sources bring out the need for better energy management and forecasting models. This article seeks to find the most suitable energy consumption prediction model through a review of studies that have developed data-based building energy consumption prediction models, with a particular focus on the machine learning algorithms used for prediction and some performance measures used for evaluation.
