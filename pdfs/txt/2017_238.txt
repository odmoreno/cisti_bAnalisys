Decision support system using mobile app statistics
ABSTRACT
Nowadays to make the right decision about where and how to request or buy a service, a user is often supported by a mobile device that offers more than simple descriptive data. Nevertheless, not all information on services is fully accessible. The difficulty in keeping track of changes in services' costs causes delays and can result in waste of time and money. In fact, the decision of which service to use usually involves some level of uncertainty and risk. Hence, the user should have access to some form of decision support system that could be easily available through mobile applications. The power of these devices allows to apply knowledge areas already developed, carrying statistics with dynamic and interactive graphics, thus allowing for a more systematic control of services and corresponding expenses. In this work we analyze the existing related work on mobile decision support systems and propose an architecture of a decision support system using Mobile App Statistics. Tests were carried out with a car fuel app to support the decision of choosing the gas station at each point. Results show that using the additional statistical information provided users can take better decisions during the request of a service.
