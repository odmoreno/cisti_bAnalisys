Recycle Made Easy : A prototype to support recycling activities
ABSTRACT
Environmental concerns are part of the priority agenda of modern societies. There are several forums and lines of action encouraged to avoid effects of degradation of the global environmental balance. Examples of this are policies to reduce the release of gases into the atmosphere, reduce the use of plastic materials, reduce the ecological footprint, or reduce the release of waste into the oceans, among others. One of the actions that citizens can carry out in their daily lives to actively contribute to this problem is by contributing to the recycling of their household waste. However, there is still much to be done to make this useful contribution available to everyone, and one of the main aspects is the frequent and correct delivery of waste at the collection points that exist in cities. This article describes the development of a computer platform that, among other features, allows identifying the type of object to be recycled and indicating where it can be deposited. The objective is to contribute to encouraging good recycling practices and simultaneously encourage and raise awareness among citizens to an increasingly useful practice of healthy citizenship. The requirements, the architecture and also the results achieved with the developed prototype are presented in the article.
