The use of artificial intelligence in learning management systems in the context of higher education : Systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing, and its application is spreading at a good pace in recent years, so much so that AI has become part of everyday life in various sectors. According to several international reports, AI in Education is one of the emerging fields of technology in the education sector, from where much research is being developed to support educational processes. This paper aims to provide an overview of the research on AI applications in education management systems (LMS) in higher education through a systematic literature review following the protocol proposed by Kitchenham [1]. Three hundred six papers were initially identified from Scopus and EBSCOhost databases from 2010 to 2022, from which 33 papers were selected for final analysis according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The research results show that the LMS most used for implementing AI solutions in education is Moodle and that AI has been most used for student performance assessment based on student data. Among the AI algorithms used, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-means, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and decision trees stand out.
