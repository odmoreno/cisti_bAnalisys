The Augmented Reality in Lisbon Tourism
ABSTRACT
Augmented reality (RA) in tourism has contributed to revolutionizing the way tourists and visitors access information, acquire knowledge and integrate into the physical spaces and destinations visited. The studies produced concerning this field are still limited, particularly in the perception of how users adopt technology and what use they make of it. On the other hand, even more limited are the studies that consider the role of stakeholders in the implementation of AR technology. Thus, this study proposes a new Augmented Reality Technology Adoption Model, based on the adaptation of the Technology Adoption Model [11, 12, 13] and also by the applying of tourist surveys in the city of Lisbon and structured interviews to public and private agents operating in the tourist context of the city of Lisbon, in order to study the use and effects of AR technology.
