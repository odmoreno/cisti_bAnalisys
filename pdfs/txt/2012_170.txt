Characterization of texture in image of skin lesions by support vector machine
ABSTRACT
Due to the increased incidence of skin cancer, computational methods based on intelligent approaches have been developed to aid dermatologists in the diagnosis of skin lesions. This paper proposes a method to classify texture in images, since it is an important feature for the successfully identification of skin lesions. For this is defined a feature vector, with the fractal dimension of images through the box-counting method (BCM), which is used with a SVM to classify the texture of the lesions in to non-irregular or irregular. With the proposed solution, we could obtain an accuracy of 72.84%.
