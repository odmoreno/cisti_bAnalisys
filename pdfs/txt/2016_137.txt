A survey on computer assisted qualitative data analysis software
ABSTRACT
Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) may be defined as tools that help researchers developing qualitative research projects. These software packages help the users with tasks such as transcription analysis, writing and annotation, coding and text interpretation, recursive abstraction, content search and analysis, discourse analysis, data mapping, grounded theory methodology, among several other types of analysis. This paper surveys the most relevant CAQDAS software packages comparing their features on different areas such as data management and organization, data annotation, search and query capacities, data visualization, import/export potentialities and teamwork/ collaborative work features.
