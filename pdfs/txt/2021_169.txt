The role of marketing in the development of digital touchpoints
ABSTRACT
With the advancement of technology in the mobile applications sector, customer's travel experience/ journey has undergone several transformations. The use of digital applications in tourism improves the customer journey and consumer engagement. This project aims to develop a digital platform to better respond to customersâ€™ needs and travel agencies. A two-step multidimensional approach was applied to achieve this goal. The first step was based on benchmarking and the second step was based on visual identity factors, prototyping, and usability tests. The results indicate that it is possible to build a platform based on marketing principles to answer to the supply and demand needs of the tourism sector. Improvements to the website will include the development of the remaining elements and screens necessary to achieve the final product.
