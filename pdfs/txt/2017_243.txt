Usability and satisfaction assessment of vocational training students in terms of their initial motivation: Mobile comerce course using SCC methodology
ABSTRACT
The usability and satisfaction results of vocational training students are presented in the current paper, obtained from the deliveries of a mobile commerce course which uses SCC methodology (Scenario Centered Curriculum). The results are framed inside the project Learning 4 work, which is aimed at developing strategies in the vocational training framework in Spain, Italy and France, in order to achieve three main goals: improving the learning processes, increasing the work placement rate and decreasing the school dropout rate. The assessed course has been executed in two differentiated formats: a local one (formed by student groups from the same school) and an international one, with groups formed by students coming from the different countries of the project. The results analyze the course methodology, as well as the satisfaction and usability variables, all in terms of the students' initial motivation and the typology of the course followed. Finally, both the external and internal variables that characterize the obtained results have been analyzed.
