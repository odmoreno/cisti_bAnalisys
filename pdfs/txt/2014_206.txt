Federated network infrastructure applied to ultra-genetic sequencing
ABSTRACT
The joint use of Supercomputing and Cloud Computing (HPCC: High Performance Cloud Computing) still not being properly applied in sectors of government and industry. Based on both technologies, the FI4VDI project, which aims to create a network of border federated infrastructure for the generation of virtualization services jobs is presented. The applicability of the genetic network ultrasecuenciaci√≥n is proposed in order to provide significant support geneticists in the study of genetic diseases.
