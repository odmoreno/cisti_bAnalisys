Technology usage as a way to increase safety and security in different geographies: Testimonials on the use of technology in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
ABSTRACT
This study follows an interpretivist approach and showcases five testimonials of technology usage in everyday life, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the research also brings forward the perspectives of 31 other Brazilian citizens. The informants are Brazilian Master's level students who were on an exchange program to Portugal, at a major Portuguese university. Brazil, and in particular Rio de Janeiro, the focus of this study, are seen to have talented people and to be also open to technology - on the developing side as well as on the user side. Trust issues still exist - concerning e-commerce - and may indeed be pervasive in society. Brazil is currently undergoing a profound social and economic crisis, which it is trying to recover from. Indeed, the general lack of safety and security felt in Rio de Janeiro may even be a reason for the popularity of home and work deliveries - so that citizens will not have to travel - with travel constituting an additional risk which many may prefer to avoid. Thus, technology (a diverse set of apps) may be serving an additional purpose - that of ensuring security in daily life in Brazil.
