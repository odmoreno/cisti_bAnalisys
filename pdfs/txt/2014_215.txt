Digital games played by Portuguese students: Gender differences
ABSTRACT
This paper presents results from a survey conducted in 2013 in Portugal to students from 5th grade (10 years) to University Students (Master's degree). The sample included 2303 subjects, 1273 male and 1030 female. The results show the five most mentioned games according to student's grade level and gender, emphasizing the similarities and differences. Participants were also inquired about their receptiveness to learn school subjects through games and what kind of games they would prefer. Students expressed themselves favorably. However, there is a difference between the kind of games suitable for learning, and the games most played by University Students.
