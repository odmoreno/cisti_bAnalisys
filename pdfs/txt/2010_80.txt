A knowledge management system for study of quality of life in head and neck cancer patients
ABSTRACT
The perception that an individual has on his place in life, with your culture and values, defines the individual quality of life (QoL). When applied in a health context is defined as: Quality of Life Related to Health (QdLRH). The evaluation of QdVRH is an objective in medicine, used in clinical research, in medical practice in health economic studies and strategic planning for health management. Achieving self-patient response to instruments measuring QoL, made through friendly software, easy to adapt to the user, helping to research, promotes the creation of databases and their statistical processing speeds. The possibility to translate into chart the results, immediately after obtaining the responses, transform, this evaluation in a diagnostic tool to use in routine clinical practice. The Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) applied in this context, let you create and store knowledge and guide the therapeutic decision. This article the routine QdVRS evaluation whit KMS. Describes the importance of a detailed analysis to identify requirements that lead to the development of an implementation model that enables to convert tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, which it does not affect the normal functioning of health facilities and to promote the optimization of the QoL cancer patient.
