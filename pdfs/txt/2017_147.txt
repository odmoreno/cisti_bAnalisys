Teachers' factors that influence the english language teaching-learning process in Ecuadorian high schools in the context of e-Education and society
ABSTRACT
In Ecuador, English is taught in elementary and high schools; however, when students enter higher education, it is evidenced that they have little or no knowledge about the language. Therefore, as a university involved in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher training, we are interested in discovering to what extent the factors concerning teachers affect the learning of English in the e-society. This study is based on a mixed method design, and explores teacher's factors that intervene in the English language teaching-learning process, which affect students' learning in Ecuadorian high schools. The sample included 1155 Ecuadorian teachers. The data was collected through the application of a questionnaire designed to gather teachers' opinions, and observations to support the data obtained from the questionnaire. In order to establish the internal consistency of the items researched, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used. The findings showed that although the majority of teachers have a degree in EFL, their professional practice reflects lack of training, low English level, and inappropriate use of pedagogical and technological teaching resources, which influence e-education.
