Accessibility Assessment in an Inclusive Course for Hearing Impaired Develop from SELI Platform
ABSTRACT
Accessibility is a fundamental part of inclusion in learning, especially in online courses, so that the student, regardless of their physical or cognitive limitations, can have autonomy in carrying out a course. This paper analyzes and discusses accessibility for the hearing impaired in digital courses made available on the SELI platform, following WCAG 2.1, from some automatic tools, in addition to a manual assessment. The results show that the automatic accessibility assessments needed to be complemented with the manual assessment. In addition, the accessible course developed with the help of the SELI platform for the hearing-impaired inclusion needs improvements, especially in the provision of multisensory content.
