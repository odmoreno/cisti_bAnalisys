A new Approach to Sustainability and Creativity in Requirements Engineering
ABSTRACT
Current concerns in the field of sustainability are cross-cutting across several sectors. In this sense, the ability of organizations to effectively use information and communication technologies and to focus on sustainability, innovation and creativity are recognized as important factors. In this article, an approach is proposed to incorporate sustainability factors when introducing creativity into the Requirements Engineering process. With a view to building more agile and sustainable Information Systems, a case of applying the approach in identifying requirements is presented, incorporating sustainability concerns. The approach stimulates the discussion on sustainability in its multiple dimensions (human, environmental, social, technical, and economic), focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals and the needs of people.
