Proposal for an Intelligent System to Stimulate the Demand for Thermal Tourism
ABSTRACT
The economic sector of tourism has gained significant weight in the economy of many countries, highlighting the weight of this sector in Portugal. However, the inconsistency and seasonality of demand causes companies linked to the sector to encounter difficulties regarding the planning and management of resources allocated to the activity. It is often the case that there are periods of economic loss caused by a small volume of demand that is insufficient to support the costs of the activity. In this context, this article proposes a system that, based on intelligent data analysis, allows a hotel chain to segment customers and enhance exclusive offers to minimize fluctuation and demand gaps in hotel units installed in thermal instances.
