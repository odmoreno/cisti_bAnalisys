Mathematical Mission : A ludical and motivate educational game
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the development of a computer artefact to aid in mathematic teaching learning process. The artefact it's being created like an educational game of mathematics, named “Missão Matemática”. It permits calculate the four mathematics basic operations (add, subtraction, multiplication and division) in a ludical and motivate way, with gamification stimulation. Its target audience will be students of basic and fundamental education, in interval age between 6 and 11 years old. The results will be analyzed through an experimental evaluation, which will be divided into three steps. The first step will evaluate the game usability. The second step will evaluate how ludical, motivate and pedagogical it is the use of this game. The third step will evaluate the student's acceptability and learning level. The first steps will be evaluated by teachers and last step will be evaluated by students.
