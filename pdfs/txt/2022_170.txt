Influential factors in knowledge management in the acceptance of M-learning in university students
ABSTRACT
The purpose of the research was to establish the influence of the factors in knowledge management in the acceptance of M-learning in university students in times of covid-19. The study consisted of two stages; the first was an exploratory factor analysis, which allowed the instrument to be validated and homologated. The second stage consisted of carrying out a confirmatory analysis by validating a structural model based on variances called modelling of structural equations of partial minimum squares PLS-SEM, whose results determined that the most influential factors in the application of knowledge are perceived ease of use, knowledge sharing, and perceived utility of the model (TAM); not like this, the intention of behavioural use, that does not influence the application of knowledge. This hypothesis would not be tested regarding the level of influence that the application of knowledge would have on the actual use of the system. The research was carried out with 150 students from a private university in Peru.
