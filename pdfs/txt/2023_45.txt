Applying Artificial Intelligence for Talent Retention: a Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Retaining talented and experienced employees is vital to the success of any organization. Our work seeks to explore how studies apply tools based on Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources ecosystems, specifically for talent retention in innovation ecosystem companies. Initially, searches were performed for primary studies in the selected digital libraries, based on the search string, obtaining a quantitative result of 1492 studies. After reading the titles and abstracts, previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, selecting the 113 potentially relevant primary studies. These studies were completely read, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied again. This Systematic Literature Review obtained 13 relevant primary studies as a quantitative result. As a result of the qualitative analysis, 76.92% of the papers directly or indirectly present the reasons for migrating or retaining employees. We also found that the same percentage of studies (76.92%) offer some model, of which 46.15% of the studies predicting the risk of an employee resigning.
