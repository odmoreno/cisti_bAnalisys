Perception of Human Fatigue in the Operational Performance of Air Traffic Controllers from the Perspective of Structural Equations
ABSTRACT
This article aims to present an analysis of the perception of human fatigue as a contributing factor in the operational performance of operators working in air traffic control in uninterrupted twenty-four-hour shifts. For this study to be possible, the methodology was used through exploratory-explanatory research, of an applied nature, with a quantitative approach, using the following sources as a data collection technique: document analysis of the Air Force Command, national and international organizations, brainstorming with specialists in psychology, investigation, and prevention of aeronautical accidents, and air traffic control. A survey was applied to contain 13 objective questions to collect information related to human fatigue that impacts operational performance through the perception of operators who work in operational bodies. As a result, obtained through the 108 responses, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied, which revealed that, according to the perception of the interviewees, the model explains the operational performance in 34.7 %, alertness by 29.9%, and reaction time by 31.2%. Thus, it is expected that from this research, the proposed suggestions related to the variables will be implemented to preserve the professional's health and operational safety.
