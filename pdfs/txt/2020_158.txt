A framework to profile corporate projects
ABSTRACT
The accelerated advance of Information Technologies (IT) has led organizations facing new challenges in IT governance, as key elements for corporate strategy. A clear example is the decision-making regarding the acquisition, adoption, or implementation of technological platforms, where managers should consider whether they make large investments in software, training, and workforce. For this reason, it is important to be sure that the platform that is being used and the project types are being carried out, do correspond to the true vocation and profile of the organization. However, the proliferation of platforms and their heterogeneity increase the uncertainty in these decisions. This article presents a framework to identify the IT profile of a project or an organization, based on six defined categories: Software development, Platform integration, Business process management, Internet of things, Data analytics, and Open ecosystems of Artificial Intelligence. As an evaluation of the framework, an application case is presented in a company in the health area, within a technological project aimed at improving customer service throughout its area of influence (Colombia). We apply experimental instruments to identify the dominant profiles by units of the company and the roles representativeness involved.
