Analysis of information security in the PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake)blockchain protocols as an alternative for handling confidential nformation in the public finance ecuadorian sector
ABSTRACT
Blockchain technology relies on a growing number of globally distributed ledgers known as blockchain. This technology was used for the creation of the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin that allows transactions to be carried out quickly and easily, without the need to use an intermediary "financial institution". The information is sent trough the protocols known as: PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake), which must guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. The present work shows the result of a bibliographic review on the evolution of the blockchain, the PoW and PoS protocols; as well as the application of these within the framework of Ecuadorian legislation with emphasis on the evolution of risks of the PoW protocol.
