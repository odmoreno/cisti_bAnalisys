Ethics and IT: Module suggestion for a future degree qualification in computing engineering
ABSTRACT
Computers have become a very important part of our society. Most operations done in industrial, commercial, military, educational and sanitary areas (among others) would not work properly without the use of computing. As society is becoming ever more dependent on computers, we are also becoming increasingly vulnerable due to the widespread misuse of them. The development of IT ethics, along with the emergence of professional ethic codes, can help us humanise the use of computing. The ACM's curriculum for its course in Computer Science encourages all universities to teach a compulsory module in worldwide social, humanitarian and ethical aspects related to computing. There are still many universities which don't offer this module.
