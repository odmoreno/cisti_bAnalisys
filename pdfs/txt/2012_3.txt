Proposal of an IT outsourcing project management methodology for suppliers
ABSTRACT
Current technological advances that have led to a globally connected economy, together with the increasing trend towards privatization and deregulation, are leading to new organizational models and increased collaboration between suppliers and customers, sharing information and process flows. This has directly contributed to the great expansion of outsourcing, considering it as a strategic tool for organizations. In this environment, and given the increasing organizational complexity, the use of a methodology to assist the implementation of outsourcing projects has become almost necessary. In recent years several methodologies and models have been proposed, especially for supporting client outsourcing organizations, but we do not consider them to be complete, they do not cover all necessary aspects to manage an outsourcing project. That is the reason because we, in this paper, propose a methodology for outsourcing project management from the point of view of the suppliers that was complete and easy to apply.
