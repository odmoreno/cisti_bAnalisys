Attribute based access control in federated clouds: A case study in bionformatics
ABSTRACT
A federated cloud environment is composed of interconnected clouds that share resources using an interface, transparent to users. In such environments, ensuring security is a complex task, since individual characteristics of each federated cloud has to be considered. This is one important issue, which can prevent companies and organizations from adopting federated clouds. In this context, this paper focuses on the problem of access control in federated clouds. Our proposal uses an attribute-based model of access control to decide whether a user can access a given resource. Besides, to evaluate the performance of our model, we performed experiments using a federated cloud specifically designed for bioinformatics application, called BioNimbuZ. The obtained results showed that our model efficiently and effectively restrict access to resources, and could be extended to other applications as well.
