Web application for lightning activity monitoring system (LAMS)
ABSTRACT
Lighting Activity Monitoring System (LAMS) project is dedicated to better understanding of lightning activity. Since LAMS monitoring station is implemented at the region with a very high lightning activity it can provide a large amount of data for analyses. In order to enable all project partners to have easy access to the collected data and project documentation, as well as comparative data from international Lighting Location System (LLS), web application with these key features is developed. In addition, partners have access to maps, charts, data filtration by different parameters and mini-forum section in which they can post topics and reports with attached files and discuss posted data in the comments.
