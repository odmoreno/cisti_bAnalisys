Design of a digital platform for the preservation and dissemination of Portuguese handicraft products
ABSTRACT
Portuguese culture embodies a wealth of artisanal heritage of high symbolic and historical value. Manual arts still prevail, but with every passing generation, fears of their eventual extinction grow. The growing scarcity of resources, the disinterest of the youngest and the difficulty of adopting digital media are seen as the main causes for concern, contributing to the ebbing away of many age-old industrial techniques, traditions, and practices. The research project "Anti-Amnesia", aims, through design, to contribute to the revitalization of this industry through digital technology as a means of dissemination and monetization. This paper presents a component of the project part that is dedicated to the experimental development of an online premise for catering to the needs of the craft sector, including an embedded marketplace. This market consists of a digital platform, where retailers have a space and tools, where they can promote and sell their products.
