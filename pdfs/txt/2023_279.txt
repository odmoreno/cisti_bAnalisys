Teacher Self-efficacy: : An insight in a time of pandemic
ABSTRACT
This article analyzes the perception of self-efficacy of a group of higher education professors (n=135) from a federal public university located in Brazil. Teachers participated in online training on virtual learning environments, with the aim of preparing them for remote classes, made mandatory as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to understand how these teachers evaluated their teaching effectiveness. A multidimensional scale was applied to assess the perception of teaching self-efficacy at the beginning of the preparation of emergency remote classes. The results showed that, for the most part, teachers had positive perceptions of self-efficacy, considering that if they put in a lot of effort, they can have a positive influence on studentsâ€™ school and personal lives.
