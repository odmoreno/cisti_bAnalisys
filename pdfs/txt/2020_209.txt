Emission of licenses versus requests for licensing of building works: KPI definition and performance monitoring
ABSTRACT
To determine the issuance of licenses versus building license requests that occurred in the last five years in a municipality, a dashboard was implemented and performance indicators were defined, thus presenting the Case Study - Emission of licenses versus building license requests, where the number of licenses emitted, i.e. the number of licenses produced, per year and municipality, as the time elapsed in the issuing of licenses versus the entry of building license requests, as well as the civil parishes that are part of the Municipality. The present study concluded which is the civil parish with the highest value of building licenses, and calculated the time elapsed since the licensing requests until the issue of the respective licenses, which is a contribution to the promotion of the KPI visualization and motoring in municipalities.
