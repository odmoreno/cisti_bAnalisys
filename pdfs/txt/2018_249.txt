Wireless system for control, monitoring and preventive maintenance of public street lighting
ABSTRACT
The present article proposes a system of management, control and monitoring of street lighting, applying a distributed infrastructure through a network of field sensors defined by the Enhanced ShockBurst protocol which will be responsible for controlling and managing each of the lamps individually. public lighting system, a gateway responsible for receiving each of the individual frames of the sensor nodes, consolidate the information and send them via TCP / IP to a database hosted on a remote server based on Open Source, the operator through Web interfaces based on asynchronous update technologies and interaction with databases (AJAX, JAVASCRIPT and PHP) will have real-time information about what happens with the public lighting system. The development of the system is subject to the regulation 005/14 established by the ARCONEL Electricity Regulation and Control Agency, realizing a real time monitoring of the condition and operation of the lamps, alerting when the lighting service presents problems due to faults. In this way, the proposed system will optimize the resources of the institution regardless of the lighting technology used, generating reports for decision making to improve the service and in case of unexpected or interruptions of service, coordinate maintenance activities that solve the problems immediately.
