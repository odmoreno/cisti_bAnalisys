Current situation of the use of inclusive software as support to the treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Spanish-speaking countries : A view from systematic mapping
ABSTRACT
This article seeks to show the main findings in relation to the use of inclusive software within the treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Spanish-speaking countries, especially in Latin America, by reviewing the studies published in journals, books or working documents and that are found in a systematic mapping of literature. This document is the result of a doctoral research project that seeks to propose a framework for the design of inclusive applications focused on supporting the treatment of autism.This mapping seeks to have a broader vision of how we are in Latin America and Spanish-speaking countries in terms of linking inclusive software in ASD treatments. The literature exploration seeks to identify the most relevant authors in this area of knowledge, the journals and conferences that publish the most on the subject, as well as the current trends and future challenges of the use of inclusive software in treatments of this disorder.
