Next generation systems â€” Scope and application of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) a systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
According to CISCO 2016 Annual Report Security, firewalls are the most commonly used security tools by enterprises (65 percent) in the use of security defenses versus different threading's. In the scope of Information technologies, threads have been evolved and have diversified. However, and for this reason, is important detect and identify them, preventing anomalous behavior on networks. New methods are used to compare the abnormal traffic based on the analysis of the expected behavior through the usage of new generation devices, e.g., Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, that identify packages malicious and prevent that the network traffic is altered or in the worst case interrupted. This article will analyze the usage of these devices, their techniques and practical application for create new security functionalities for other devices.
