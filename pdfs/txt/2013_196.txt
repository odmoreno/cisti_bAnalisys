Mapping 3D character location for tracking players' behaviour
ABSTRACT
Serious Games are increasingly used as a tool for various applications contrary to the traditional entertainment purpose. Many game engines are available, and Unity3D is another example that presents some features such as rapid prototyping and an easy learning curve. The 3D space where action takes place is sometimes hard to map into a logical memory structure providing flexible access to that information. The problem of tracking players' path as well as their decisions in 3D environments arises when there is no previous knowledge of the scenario representation and the creation of a memory data structure poses an extra effort for the modeller. The proposed solution in this paper, albeit simple, is a straightforward way to track the location of the video game character and map it when he/she passes certain limits. This mechanism proved to represent a key step forward, addressing the important issue of tracking the decision-making process of players for future analysis and behaviour elicitation.
