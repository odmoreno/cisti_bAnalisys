Implementation of a Learning Management System (LMS) in an Angolan higher education institution: a systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
E-Learning has been widely implemented in educational institutions to improve the learning process and meet the new challenges imposed by technology in the 21st century. The implementation and use of learning management systems (LMS) in organizations have grown exponentially in recent years and have strongly impacted education, especially in higher education. The present systematic review aims to identify studies and research topics that are being addressed to improve the learning process in the e-Learning context in higher education institutions and map the studies on the implementation and use of LMS. The review process examined 30 articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria on the topic over the past five years, adopting Kitchenham's systematic review design methodology. The results showed that technology alone would not be enough for e-Learning to become a dominant teaching standard. The digital literacy of the stakeholders is crucial in this process.
