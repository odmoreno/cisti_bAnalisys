iGuion: Designing interactive videos
ABSTRACT
The research aims to develop a proposal for the design of interactive videos, which consists in the development of a iGuión (interactive script) structured by three sections or blocks that are the presentation, development and outcome. As part of the design proposal, each block of the structure adds a layer of interaction that allows to generate actions or events that influence the didactic narrative (activate events during the execution) of the audiovisual resource, creating an environment Motivating for students. The proposed design was used by a group of professors to design interactive videos in the context of distance education of the Particular Technical University of Loja in Ecuador. The iGuión was evaluated by the teachers where it obtained more than 4 points on 5 in terms of design and ease of use, the 90% of the students participated actively and according to their perception 97% of them, indicate that the interactive videos allowed increase understanding of the content treated. For the development of the work we used the research methodology of ADDIE design, which allows to evaluate the result for each cycle, improving the design of the iGuión at each stage.
