Monitoring and control of the indoor environment
ABSTRACT
The time that people spend inside buildings is very significant, so the environmental quality of these spaces is recognized as an important risk factor for human health. The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a technological revolution in the ascendant that is already present in several types of equipment. Thus, combining the need to monitor environmental parameters with a view to improving occupational health, with the Internet of Things paradigm, an automatic system has been developed that allows the monitoring and control of environmental conditions in indoor spaces through the Internet. The system allows you to collect moisture, temperature and luminosity data that are stored in a structured database. Access to monitoring data is accomplished through three applications - a Web portal, an Android application, and a Desktop application. Real-time monitoring allows detection and correction of unfavorable occupational health and energy efficiency situations by controlling external devices.
