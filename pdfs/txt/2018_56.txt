A methodological approach â€” Working emotions and learning using facial expressions
ABSTRACT
This work proposes a teaching model that uses the student's emotions to improve the teaching-learning process. For this, it uses software to capture students `facial expressions during classes, and later, algorithms analyze and establish correlations between students' facial expressions, emotions, teaching methodologies and student performance. To perform these analyzes will be used artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning to establish correlations. This work has been under way for twelve months.
