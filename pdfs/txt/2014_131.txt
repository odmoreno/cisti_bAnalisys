Ontology supported information extraction for document of evidence-based nursing domain
ABSTRACT
The increasing amount of information available in electronic media is a strategic resource for the health professional who uses this source to support decision making. However, it is not feasible to analyze a significant number of documents in a short time without the support of a computational tool. The Information Extraction aims to extract from textual documents only the relevant information defined by the user. This information can be mapped and classified in the field of health through ontologies. This paper proposes the design of an information extracting mechanism that, in a hybrid form, can combine: an extractor for textual documents; the construction and use of a domain ontology for evidence-based nursing, aiming to assist in the classification of documents which will be extracted by the extractor and in the representation of this domain with respect to the computational area.
