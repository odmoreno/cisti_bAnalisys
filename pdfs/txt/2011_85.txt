Web based geographic information platform for tourism
ABSTRACT
Several developments have been observed recently in areas such as Web development, social networks, interface design, recommendation systems and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The integration of these developments can provide a superior experience, greater than the sum of their individual contributions, regarding user satisfaction. This paper proposes an integration of all these innovations in e-tourism, more specifically by the development of a Web based geographic information platform adaptable to any tourist region. As a case study, we also show how this platform was adapted to the Douro region, in Portugal. The Web platform developed as a proof of concept combines geospatial information from diverse and heterogeneous data sources, encompassing events, news, routes and points of interest (POI). This platform provides also a recommendation engine and features the possibility that users can contribute with content as part of the community, thus emerging a mini social network.
