PRO2S - System for the Protection and Monitoring of the Elderly and Mentally I11 in Outdoor
ABSTRACT
Monitoring of the elderly or people with a particular type of dementia, such as Alzheimer's, is of great importance, especially when some functional capacities, such as reasoning, orientation, among others, are beginning to be compromised. The present work presents a system model that will allow the real time monitoring of elderly people or who suffer from some neurodegenerative pathology or mental deficiency, more likely to suffer occasional outbreaks of memory loss that may compromise their safety. Real-time monitoring includes vital signs monitoring equipment and the approximate location within and shape of the facilities, which will allow monitoring technicians at Private Social Solidarity Institutions (IPSS) to verify in real time the physical condition of their users. This system intends to make a significant leap in the use of ubiquitous and pervasive, nonintrusive computing, in the support of entities related to the Social Protection sector. In this way, the monitoring and followup of the users will be carried out by a specialized technician who can at any moment initiate a process of search and rescue of some users who may be in danger, that leaves the protection zone confined to IPSS, that loses vital signs, or is facing any other adverse event that could compromise their safety and, in the limit, their own life.
