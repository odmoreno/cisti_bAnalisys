Mr Dustman a Multitasking Digital Game for Older Adults who Suffer from Mild Cognitive Impairment and Urinary Incontinence
ABSTRACT
Since the world population is getting older, it is crucially important to keep this considerable part of the population active and, consequently, healthy. Over the past few years, there is an increasing interest in studies to analyze and leverage the digital games' unique capability of engaging older adults physically and mentally. Furthermore, digital games are genre and age neutral and can be used for preventing health conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Urinary Incontinence (UI) in the old age. UI and MCI are two prevalent diseases among older adults. The aim of this paper is to present the game design process and the evaluation of a multitasking digital game for this target audience and teach them some reliable exercises that could be used to address these diseases.
