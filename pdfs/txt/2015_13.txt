Conception of a formative distance service about modalities of payment in e-Commerce
ABSTRACT
The paper starts with an overview of the state of the art in technology mediated service in the e-learning field about payments in the e-Commerce market. With the fast grow of distance learning technologies it is important to think about some innovations in the pedagogic strategies to improve education. The students have different learning styles and the tutor needs to support those needs, to ensure the quality of learning and keep them motivated. As an answer to a lack of organized information in this field we create a module about different modalities of payment in e-Commerce as a formative mediated technology service using the platform BlackBoard coursesites to deliver and mediate the instruction, supported in different types of communication (synchronous and asynchronous).
