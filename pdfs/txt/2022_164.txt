Skills Me - Knowledge Exchange Platform
ABSTRACT
This work presents the development of the SkillsMe platform. It is in the initial phase of development, which is being developed using the Kotlin language. Its objective is to provide an environment for the exchange of knowledge among its users, in a collaborative way. Its target audience is people interested in improving their intellectual level, through personal, professional or hobby development. These users will be able to develop and share skills through the use of the SkillsMe platform. It will be an application for mobile devices based on the Android system. The SkillsMe platform will be a computational artifact that will offer a way to inspire its users in the search for new knowledge. Its focus will be to make the user awaken their desire to share knowledge, experiences and learning with other users. It is planned to be carried out, as an experimental evaluation, the evaluation of the usability of the SkillsMe platform, through the System Usability Scale (SUS) method.
