One of the key features of a government website should be accessibility. The purpose of this article is to present a panorama of the accessibility of the official government websites of different countries, using automatic tests according to the guidelines of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. It was concluded that none of the countries has minimally accessibility requirements. For a small number of countries it was possible to observe the relationship between economic and social indicators and accessibility in government portals, but it was not possible to generalize the results.
