Doce Desafio: Software to control and monitoring of type 1 diabetes in mobile devices
ABSTRACT
This work purposes an application to mobile devices that helps both health professionals that act in the treatment of the disease, and its patients. The application allows the user to inform diabetes monitoring relevant data, such as the measure of blood sugar level, the amount of insulin used in each application, the physical activities performed and the meals of the patient's diet. Besides, it has a mechanism that suggests the amount of corrective insulin that must be managed before or after each meal. Tests were carried out with type 1 diabetic patients, endocrinologists, nutritionists and professionals in physical education. Results showed that software meets the main needs of both patient and his multiprofessional team.
