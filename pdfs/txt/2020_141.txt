Use of a fab lab in STEAM education : Development of Information Technologies inserted in a smart city context through a fablab
ABSTRACT
Two very widespread concepts around the globe have become obsolete, the concepts of cities as we know them today, with too much exploitation of existing natural resources and the concept of education, where it is still taught as in the last century. Although there are new tools capable of improving this scenario, such as information technologies in communication, they are still little used to adapt these concepts to the reality in which we live today. To this end, new ways of thinking about cities and education are emerging. Smart cities, the STEAM education model, ICTs and digital labs (fab labs), can be a powerful combination in the development and implementation of technologies capable of helping in this transition.
