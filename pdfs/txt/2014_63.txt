Telemedicine platform for monitoring diabetic retinopathy
ABSTRACT
Early detection of diseases in humans can start treatment and mitigate health consequences. Diabetic retinopathy can be detected early and treated to avoid serious damage to the retina of patients. This paper presents a computational model for monitoring diabetic retinopathy, based on telemedicine and technological tools, which enables communication practitioners (optometrists) in field with medical specialists in order to support the diagnosis and feed a data repository that is accessible in real time and from anywhere. For the design of the platform was taken into account manual diagnostic protocol by using retinal photographs taken on a mobile device. As a result it has a telemedicine platform that supports the processes of diagnosis, care and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy in vulnerable areas in Colombia.
