An Authoring Tool for the Creation and Correction of Educational Content for Hybrid Television
ABSTRACT
Despite the constant increase in households of smart devices for individual use, television remains a familiar meeting point for entertainment [1]. With the emergence of hybrid television, a new multi-user environment that combines traditional television and the Internet emerges. The STVALL project takes advantage of this new panorama by proposing the development of an educational platform for interactive and adaptive teaching, individual or group, of languages through smart television. Through the use of HbbTV technology, customized training pills stored in the knowledge base of the platform and generated by language experts will be offered to the user or the user group. This article presents the authoring tool that allows the creation of these training pills by the team of experts. In addition, some of these pills require some feedback from experts to users, so this authoring tool provides the necessary mechanisms to provide it.
