Act Against the Aggression : A Preliminary Model of a Digital Platform Aimed at Cyberaggressions in the Portuguese University Environment
ABSTRACT
This article presents a preliminary digital platform model to combat and prevent cyberaggressions in the Portuguese university environment. The characteristics and the necessary functionalities to be present in the platform were taken from eight interviews with Portuguese university students carried out in the context of a Ph.D. thesis on risk perception and precautionary behavior in the face of cyberaggressions. Through the interviews, it was possible to identify that a digital platform aimed at the university context is a viable alternative to provide support to victims and others involved in aggressive situations online, reducing the impacts of cyberaggressions. Among the most relevant functionalities to be present in the platform is the existence of direct channels with the rectory and with the authorities to carry out anonymous reports, and a step-by-step guideline on reporting aggression in each of the social networks, as well as links for services provided by universities in terms of mental health. Concerns about the veracity of complaints on the platform and their maintenance by moderators were challenges posed by students.
