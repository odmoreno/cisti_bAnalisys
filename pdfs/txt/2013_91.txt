ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results obtained from the improvement project of the MATVOX system, that is, basically, an advanced interpreter of a defined language. The tool's aim is to support the visually impaired in the exact science areas. It is functional from the text editor which is part of the free system DOSVOX, which is based on speech synthesis and aims to support the visually impaired.
