Accounting for change: the importance of information technology in the accountants academic qualification
ABSTRACT
The fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) is reinventing the business world. The accounting profession, in particular, denotes changes with the inclusion of new paradigms, concepts and systems, such as big data analysis or cloud computing, in addition to accountant core business activity. This research shows the actual offer in the area of information technology in college degrees, recognized by the Portuguese Order of Certified Accountants. Its main goal is to emphasize the importance of these technologies in accounting courses and their implications for accountants. A specific research methodology was set up, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques such as interviews, content analysis, and statistical analysis, that allowed the assessment of data provided by higher educational institutions, namely the syllabus contents of the curricular units. The findings show that most educational institutions pertaining to the research sample already include content such as information technologies in their curricular plans. However, technological change is constant, and educational institutions need a transitional period to meet market demands. Thus, a favorable and sustainable environment must be developed to provide technical skills and human knowledge, which constitutes the main factor of differentiation and competitiveness in todayâ€™s society.
