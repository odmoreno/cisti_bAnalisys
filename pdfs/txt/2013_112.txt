Enterprise resource planning post-adoption value: A literature review amongst small and medium enterprises
ABSTRACT
It is consensual that Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) after a successful implementation has significant effects on the productivity of firm as well small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) recognized as fundamentally different environments compared to large enterprises. There are few reviews in the literature about the post-adoption phase and even fewer at SME level. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge there is none with focus in ERP value stage. This review will fill this gap. It provides an updated bibliography of ERP publications published in the IS journal and conferences during the period of 2000 and 2012. A total of 33 articles from 21 journals and 12 conferences are reviewed. The main focus of this paper is to shed the light on the areas that lack sufficient research within the ERP in SME domain, in particular in ERP business value stage, suggest future research avenues, as well as, present the current research findings that could support researchers and practitioners when embarking on ERP projects.
