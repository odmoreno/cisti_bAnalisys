Knowledge extraction tacit for software process improvement in a governmental organization
ABSTRACT
The product quality is heavily influenced by the quality of the software processes associated within any organization of software product and services development. However, an aspect in common among these organizations is the lack of ability to build or formalize tacit knowledge that allows them to maximize their competitiveness and focus efforts on the implementation of software process improvement. Therefore, this paper presents a method for the extraction of tacit knowledge applied in a government organization. The method integrates the identification of the current state of the organization, a s well as, extract, identify and define best practices within the organization, to understand how they work. In addition, a case study is presented in order to obtain results of the proposed method.
