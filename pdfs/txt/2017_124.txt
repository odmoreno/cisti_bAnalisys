Exploring technologically enhanced reading materials in L2 learning contexts
ABSTRACT
Technology-enhanced materials provide students with higher quality learning experiences offering them multimodal modes of information. One way of integrating technology into teaching materials is through the inclusion of hyperlinks and hypertexts which provide digitally accessible sources of information. The use of hyperlinks in English language coursebooks has significantly increased over the past decade in Portugal, in response to the ever increasing demand for authentic learning materials. In this paper, we survey an ongoing research project aimed at investigating the extent to which such hyperlinked texts can also be used to contribute to higher quality language learning.
