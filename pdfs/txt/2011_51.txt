User modeling for activity recognition and support in Ambient Assisted Living
ABSTRACT
Current research work shows that progress on AI and wireless sensor networks, made it possible to improve the quality of life of the people with disabilities using recent technologies. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is one of the well-known research areas that has a goal to use ambient intelligent technologies to support people with special demands to live longer periods in their proffered environment. The prime challenges of the AAL are recognition of the assisted person's current activity and providing appropriate support to the person. But these systems need extensive studies on user modeling to be more efficient to adapt the changes of user capabilities and preferences which is strongly correlated with the prime challenges of AAL. In this paper, a user model has been proposed that tends to be used in the autonomous and reliable recognition.
