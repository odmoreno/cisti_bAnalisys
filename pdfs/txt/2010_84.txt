An information management web system for developing the Galician rural milieu: The commercialization of agricultural products from family farms
ABSTRACT
Granxafamiliar.com is a project for developing the Galician rural milieu both socio-economically and culturally in order to appreciate the quality of life and rural culture, to create communication links between the rural and urban world, to emphasize the importance of the traditional self-supply production market of Galician family farms, and to promote the spread of new technologies as a social intervention tool against the phenomenon of social and territorial exclusion known as the â€œDigital Divide". We are hoping to promote it globally across the Internet by promoting the use and spread of ICTs (information and communication technologies) as tools and commercial channels for agricultural products, equally well-known among rural and urban communities, as well as information and learning channels.
