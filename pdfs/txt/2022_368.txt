Monitoring the allocation of European Structural and Investment Funds in Algarve: a dashboard proposal
ABSTRACT
Portugal 2020 is a partnership program between Portugal and the European Commission, for the application in Portugal of European Structural and Investment Funds, from 2014 to 2020. The principles underlying Portugal 2020 are consistent with the objectives of Europe 2020. This paper is based on the analysis of the application of funds from the European Union (EU) in the Algarve region, highlighting the municipalities with the highest volume of approved funds, where and for what purpose they are used. To this end, five dashboards were developed, which expose the most relevant information in a single layout, using Microsoft Power BI. These make it possible to know the allocation of funds by year, category, thematic objective and municipality and support decision-making in the region. The thematic objective "03- Strengthening the competitiveness of SMEs" has received the largest volume of funds and Algarve has received more funds from the European Regional Development Fund. This work aims to contribute with new insights into data available online, as well as to highlight projects developed in an academic context with real data, improving students' knowledge about funding programs.
