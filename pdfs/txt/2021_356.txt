The Role of Digital Marketing in Plant-based Food Buying Decision Process : A qualitative study with adopters and sympathizers
ABSTRACT
This article studies the influence of digital marketing in consumers' making process regarding plant-based diet. The investigation was exploratory, and adopted a descriptive method, consisting of 11 face-to-face interviews and four focus groups with plant-based diet adopters and supporters. A non-probabilistic convenience sampling method was used to recruit participants. This study found that supporters differ from adopters of a plant-based diet regarding their concerns with certification and the difficulty in understanding labels.
