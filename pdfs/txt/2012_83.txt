Providing safe and legal validity of forensics documents of the Brazilian Federal Police
ABSTRACT
By the nature of its activity, the forensics division of Brazilian Federal Police Department (DPF) collects, analyzes and keeps trace evidences in police investigations. Due to the existence of various forms of management systems in forensic departments throughout the country, the National System of Criminology Activities Management was developed. The increase in its use leads to the need to evaluate and propose security solutions that enable the use of forensics digital documents by the Brazilian judicial system. These solutions include the adoption of digital certification and digital signature of documents. This paper presents an analysis of the current state of system in regard to security and proposes actions related to the adoption of solutions that aim to increase safety and ensure the legal validity of documents.
