Increasing Information Systems Availabiliy Through Accuracy, Awareness, Completeness and Manageability of ITSM
ABSTRACT
In today's information age the increase importance of Information Systems (IS) which are highly dependent of Information Technology (IT) forces organizations to deploy IT Service Management (ITSM) frameworks. The increase complexity of new IT technologies, products and deployment models makes the management of an IS a big challenge to manage and to ensure its availability. This complexity drives IT organizations to manage the environment by silos or technologies and inhibits a holistic view of the target environment leaving space for failures. This paper intends to analyze and identify these issues and proposes an IT management framework that will help IT organizations to provide a better management of IS.
