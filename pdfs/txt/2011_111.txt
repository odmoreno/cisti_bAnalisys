Information and Communication Technologies as a support to the learning process in Higher Education
ABSTRACT
In this article, a preliminary analysis of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the context of Higher Education (HE) takes place. This analysis seeks to verify if it there has been, in particular, a change of practice by teachers and whether this occurrence could be related to the introduction of the Bologna model, making the teaching process more dynamic, less expository and more supported by ICT. As a primary basis of work, the adoption of platforms for online learning and its impact on teaching and learning model in the ES are questioned, with reference to the integration of the MOODLE platform in Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP). In this case, it was found that there is a low level of adherence to the use of the teaching online platform, even in its simplest form of information repository, and some resistance on the part of teachers was detected (even regarding the use the platform in the context of blended-learning - b-Learning).
