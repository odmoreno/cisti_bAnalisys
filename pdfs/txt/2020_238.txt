Analysis of geolocation accuracy by GPS: dedicated support signal integration and collaborative network in location-based services
ABSTRACT
Currently, mobile devices, tablets and smartphones, among others, integrate geolocation systems supported by GPS or A-GPS sensors that have digital mapping functionalities, with the possibility of storage, routing and location information systems, among those, called location-based services (LBS). This technology allows the user to integrate approximate apparent position in real time between 3 and 6 meters. This approximation to the real position is valid for the LBS in applications of routing and tourism among others, but not for cadastral type surveys, urban inventories, cartographic updating or topographic support points among others. The article presents the integration of the processes required to obtain sub metric precisions in geolocation with mobile devices, in order to make accessible to all the professional use and the integration of new services.
