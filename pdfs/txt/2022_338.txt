E-government and environmental degradation
ABSTRACT
In the current context of constant technological progress, as a factor in the sustained growth of economies, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) have stood out for their role in increasing labour productivity, to the point that their use in public administration is urgent as an innovation strategy for efficient and effective decision-making, as well as for an increasingly optimal public management. However, the growing wave of public activities digitization worldwide has aroused the interest of environmentalists who have been concerned about "digital pollution" as a factor that degrades the environment. That is why this study aims to analyse the relationship between environmental variables and electronic government. The main results suggest that there is a direct relationship between the geographic concentration of CO2 emissions, as a proxy for environmental variables, and the rate of development of electronic government. The findings are heterogeneous when we carry out an analysis considering the countries according to their level of income per capita.
