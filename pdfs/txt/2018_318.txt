Design of a system for the management of collaborative digital groups by genetic algorithm
ABSTRACT
This research considers the management of the formation of collaborative groups to work virtually in the development of a task, considering the academic performance, the resilience and the aptitude to the technology, then, it is a multi-objective optimization. The descriptive study and based on the theories of social construction of knowledge and approximate sets, proposes the design of a genetic algorithm to establish intra-heterogeneous and inter-homogeneous teams according to the specified restrictions. The development of the proposal made it feasible to codify the students, define the genetic selection, crossing and mutation operators, which can lead to the best solution, after successive iterations and within the previously defined evaluation parameters.
