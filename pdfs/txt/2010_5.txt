Inclusive learning environment for deaf people
ABSTRACT
Our research group of education through ICTs has initiated a project on inclusive learning environment for deaf people. Since the beginning of the project the group is aware of the need to integrate new methodologies and technologies for distance education. The set of these new methodologies and technologies has been adjusted for the specific target audience. Also it is important the interdisciplinary collaboration between the agents of education and deaf community in order to develop a client oriented project.
