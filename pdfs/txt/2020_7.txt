Teaching and learning Modelling and Specification based on gamification
ABSTRACT
Video games are understood by society, particularly young people, and young adults, as a form of entertainment. However, given the transformation of society towards the digital, in recent years the games have crossed the barriers of entertainment, and have been used in more ambitious environments and purposes, especially in business and education. In this context, this practice is called gamification, being used at education and aims to make the teaching and learning more attractive and motivating. Gamification, as noted, has the principles of video games, i.e., leverage the elements of the games, which underpin its enormous success, to make learning more engaging, customizable and relevant. Its use in the teaching- learning process has been carried out in parallel with active methodologies, and in the use of learning management systems that include various elements of the game to be integrated into teaching, learning and evaluation activities. In this paper, the gamified programmatic contents idea is presented, and it specifies a level-based programmatic contents structure as well as other gamification elements used, such as points and different types of rewards, the progress bar, the leaderboard, content locking and trading. The gamified programmatic contents will be implemented on the Moodle platform.
