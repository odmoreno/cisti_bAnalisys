ICT exports: the role of human capital and economic complexity
ABSTRACT
In a context of globalization, where international trade is so importance for economic growth, knowledge turns out to be a determining factor for competitiveness in sectors that offer information and communication services. In this sense, the objective of the article is to determine the effect that the human capital and the economic complexity (knowledge proxies) of a country have on the exports of ICT services. To achieve this, estimates with panel-corrected standard errors are used (with 100 countries, between 2005 and 2017); the procedure is carried out for groups of countries, according to income level. The results indicate the existence of a direct relationship between the explained variable and the knowledge proxies.
