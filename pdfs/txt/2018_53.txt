A survey of agile software development methodologies in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
Agile methodologies have been increasingly used in software development projects worldwide. However, there is little information about the adoption of these methodologies in Latin America. In this paper, we present a study conducted in Ecuador about the use, usefulness and causes of stop using agile methodologies in medium and large organizations. The results show that a considerable percentage of professionals do not receive formal training before adopting agile methodologies, and that a high percentage of organizations, especially public, decide to abandon its use. However, private companies from the Banking sector are the ones that keep using agile.
