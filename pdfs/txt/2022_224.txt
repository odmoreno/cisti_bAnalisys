Is Blockchain the solution to the challenges of reliable interoperability in the healthcare ecosystem?
ABSTRACT
The incorporation of technology to the healthcare ecosystem is identified as a potential strategy to improve peopleâ€™s quality of life. The health ecosystem includes several interested and interconnected parties with different needs, entailing a high degree of information exchange between the actors involved. However, this information is highly fragmented and distributed, making continuous access difficult. Health care requires a permanent flow of such information, where health systems interoperate to have a global view of the historical data of a patient. However, there are several problems that prevent this objective to be met, this work is focused on identifying such problems. In this sense, Blockchain technology has a great opportunity to support the health sector, since it has multiple qualities that make it ideal for supporting the interoperability of health management systems. This document shows some of the most critical and challenging issues facing the interoperability of health systems, such as: health standards and smart contracts. Challenges for the interoperability of healthcare systems using blockchain technology are also identified and a solution from a software engineering perspective is shown. By doing this, our research extends and complements existing blockchain research in healthcare.
