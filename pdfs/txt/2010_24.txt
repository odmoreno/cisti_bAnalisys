The paper concludes with the migration of this platform to a mobility environment (transportation scenario) where the context of the user could be considered (location, desired destination, preferences.) in order to know which contents have to be provided in a proactive way. The result is an innovative platform for the proactive delivery of mobile multimedia contents contextualized to the user profile with large applications in the entertainment and tourist industry.
