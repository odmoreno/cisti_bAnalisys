Accessibility and microcopy remote testing of mobile applications: : The case of the CeNTER platform
ABSTRACT
When designing a digital solution aimed at community initiatives, it is necessary to have a great concern with all potential users, ensuring it can be easily used by anyone, regardless of any sensory or motor limitations. This article reports the developmental stage of a mobile application, which aims to promote collaboration and cooperation between different agents involved in the territorial innovation process. Accessibility and microcopy evaluations of the application prototype were carried out to improve its accessibility and ensure its use by users in several circumstances, contexts, and conditions. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic current restrictions, the tests were performed remotely, allowing the development team to deepen knowledge about the different methods and tools for implementing remote tests. This paper presents the results of this methodology of evaluation, which contributed to assess the CeNTER mobile application's adequacy and make improvements aimed at ensuring its accessibility and universality.
