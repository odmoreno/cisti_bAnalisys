The Influence of Remote Work on Turnover Rates : An action research in an IT micro-company in a Brazilian countryside city
ABSTRACT
Abstract - Technology is the sector with the highest turnover rates worldwide due to high demand for professionals and wage competitiveness, a number that is also expressive in Brazil. The index volume increased after the rise of remote work in the COVID-19 pandemic, developing a global competition for talent. The turnover was even higher in small companies far from metropolitan regions, such as XYZW (fictitious name), a company based in a Brazilian countryside city, which reached 23.07% in the index in this period. Thus, this study seeks to verify the possible impact of the rise of remote work due to the pandemic on the turnover rates of the company X Y Z W and develop an action plan for reducing this turnover. To this end, a study with two cycles of action research was conducted to identify this influence and propose interventions. The findings point out the influence of remote work on the turnover of professionals at XYZW company and up to 382% difference between her salaries and those of the market, in addition to various legal risks, promoting the immediate adherence of the action plan focused on the valorization of the IT sectors of the company. This study confirmed the influence of remote work on the turnover of the company XYZW and the gap that a small IT company outside large urban centers like it can have for the market, generating low competitiveness in the face of remote work and increasing the risks of voluntary turnover.
