Online project management architecture II
ABSTRACT
Multiple project environments are confronting a growing complexity with higher uncertainties and taut restrictions. A challenge in this research is problems and constraints of project risk management subject to sharing materials, equipments' allocation, skilled resources, and integrity information across concurrent multi-projects when project management is schedule-driven, often change requirements, cost overrun, and resource capacity is completely committed. Therefore, it is very important for an organization to enhance the online project management (OPM) in the process of implementing project management. This research proposes cloud OPM with project risk management as system dynamic approach to manage and control of concurrent construction projects. The fact findings are fast problem responses to change requirements, integrity information, costs reduction on material ordered, efficient resource relocation, economical communication, and increased project completion ratio.
