Agricultural environment monitoring system using wireless sensor networks and IoT
ABSTRACT
Monitoring and control the environmental parameters in agricultural constructions are essential to improve energy efficiency and productivity. Real-time monitoring allows the detection and early correction of unfavourable situations, optimizing consumption and protecting crops against diseases. This work describes an automatic system for monitoring farm environments with the aim of increasing efficiency and quality of the agricultural environment. Based on the Internet of Things, the system uses a low-cost wireless sensor network, called Sun Spot, programmed in Java, with the Java VM running on the device itself and the Arduino platform for Internet connection. The data collected is shared through the social network of Facebook. The temperature and brightness parameters are monitored in real time. Other sensors can be added to monitor the issue for specific purposes. The results show that conditions within greenhouses may in some cases be very different from those expected. Therefore, the proposed system can provide an effective tool to improve the quality of agricultural production and energy efficiency.
