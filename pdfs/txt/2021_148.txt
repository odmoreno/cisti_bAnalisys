Information Systems Architecture Framework for National Official Statistics Organizations
ABSTRACT
Several studies in the area of Frameworks for Information Systems Architectures recommend carrying out additional research on the support of Information Systems Architectures to the organization's businesses, using models of reference frameworks. The subject is so important mainly with regard to the support of the architectural maturity model in National Organizations for Official Statistics. However, this research has not yet been carried out, which means that there is a gap in relation to scientific knowledge. This project, therefore, aims to conduct new research in order to build a new framework to address this issue, and thus contribute to knowledge. The design science research method was selected for this research, as it is suitable for design, in addition to its pragmatic and positivist character. Two organizations producing official statistics from two different countries (Portugal and Mozambique) were selected for the empirical study and the validation of the final result. The expectation is that the new framework allows technological solutions to meet the requirements of the organizations involved in the statistical production process, generating compliance and alignment with its strategic objectives and ensuring that Information Technology takes the right actions to deliver benefits in short time.
