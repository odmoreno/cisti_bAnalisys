Gamification and E-mobile at the university
ABSTRACT
Currently, there is an increasing number of teachers from Higher Education Institutions who are looking for innovative methods, which allow the creation and management of teaching-learning spaces in a collaborative environment in which students are encouraged to interact, becoming the protagonists of their academic training. On the one hand, these institutions develop virtual courses in Technology Learning Platforms; and on the other hand, the student is increasingly immersed in the world of technology, specifically in the use of mobile devices at any time and place, for leisure purposes such as games, social networks, etc. This is how the implementation of the "6 steps to gamify" strategy can be seen in the virtual classroom of the "Ofim√°tica" course; a strategy that allows the use of game mechanics and rewards in non-play environments, such as an alternative that encourages students to participate spontaneously and actively participate in the teaching-learning process, through activities that consider certain playful aspects. This strategy has allowed to obtain results in which there is a tendency in the improvement of the academic performance of the students.
