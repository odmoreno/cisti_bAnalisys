Systematic review and comparison of modeling ETL processes in data warehouse
ABSTRACT
In a Data Warehouse (DW), ETL processes (Extraction, Transformation, Load) are responsible for extracting, transforming and loading data from the data sources into the DW. A good design of these processes in the early stages of a DW project is essential to avoid making bad decisions as a result of incorrect data. In this paper, we apply the method of systematic review to identify, extract and analyze the main proposals on modeling conceptual ETL processes for DWs. The main proposals are identified and compared based on the features, activities and notation of ETL processes. Finally we conclude the study by reflecting on the approaches being studied and providing an updated framework for future research.
