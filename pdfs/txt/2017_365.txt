Corporate online networks and channels: Communication strategies of main European public broadcasters
ABSTRACT
European public broadcasters have been analysed traditionally in terms of schedule, audiences and, more recently, public commitment. The present work approaches to this object of study from a new perspective: Identify the on-line communication strategy from the ways of access of the users and especially the weight of social networks in the public televisions Web traffic. Like organizations that develop their work in a 2.0 context, public European channels have to be known on the digital area and determine which will be the main lines of relation with their audiences, in addition to improving their strategies in social media, mostly missed. On social networks, Facebook is the main way of access. Twitter only develops, for the moment, a symbolic paper.
