Heuristic for the Students Allocation in Brazilian Public Schools: a Case Study
ABSTRACT
Annually, municipal and state education departments must enroll new students in a system school. In large educational networks, this task is performed automatically, which makes it possible to increase the efficiency of the enrollment process. This process is performed considering a series of prioritization criteria that is comfortable to the student and encourages public policies. In this work, we present a heuristic solution to the Student Allocation Problem, which evaluates groups of students with priority because of public policies and the preferences of each student. The proposed method is assessed through an entire network provided by the State Department of Education of Rio de Janeiro (SEEDUC-RJ). The results showed that the proposed heuristic performed well in a shorter computational time.
