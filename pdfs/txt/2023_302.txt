(uMind) Mobile application to support digital literacy interventions in mental health: Development and usability study.
ABSTRACT
Digital media have enabled the development of interventions aiming at mental health literacy, counseling, support and treatment. In recent years, numerous applications have emerged, being essential that these applications have scientific evaluations from specialists in the field. This study presents the development of an application which integrates digital interventions for mental health literacy aimed at university students. An evaluation of usability using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and then Standardized User Experience Percentile Rank Questionnaire (SUPR-Q) was conducted. A group of 15 participants integrated this evaluation and the results contributed to the development of the prototype. In general, the application had positive results in terms of navigation, usability, functionalities, and design; at the technical level, some problems were found and will be corrected later when the application is before the development phase is finished.
