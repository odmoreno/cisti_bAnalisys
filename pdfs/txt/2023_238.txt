Analysis of dengue data, in the municipality of Mossor贸, Northeast Brazil, between the years 2015 and 2020, using Python language
ABSTRACT
The present work consists of a case study of dengue in the city of Mossor贸, Rio Grande do Norte, Northeast Brazil, between the years 2015 and 2020; using data science tools, Python language and its libraries. First, data were extracted from the official database of the Department of Zoonoses of the Municipality of Mossor贸. After this extraction and cleaning of the data, an analysis was performed in order to understand the behavior of the disease in Mossor贸, including the outbreaks that occurred in the mentioned time interval. Among all the results obtained, it was possible to reach several conclusions, among them that the increase in dengue cases is not only related to the precipitation rate and that the neighborhoods most affected by the disease are geographically located in the same region of the municipality.
