Decision support system for a SME in the restaurant sector: Development of a prototype
ABSTRACT
Business intelligence serves a great purpose in any business, but is usually omitted or ignored by SMEs due to lack of knowledge or simply because the owners do not consider it necessary for a medium to long-term plan term. In the long run, businesses usually fail to make a profit or cannot continue, and end up without even knowing what happened. The information generated by a company could serve as a starting point for good and solid decision-making, but the culture that dominates the SMEs of any industry leaves important information without registration or connection, leaving them to work based only on evidence and errors and Mostly "luck". This paper proposes a prototype of decision support system for a SME in the restaurant sector. The results of this work show that the company (being a SME) can improve in terms of competitive advantage through this tool of business intelligence and cross the barriers where most SMEs are stagnant in Mexico.
