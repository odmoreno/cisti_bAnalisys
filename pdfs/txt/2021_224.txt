ABSTRACT
Hospitality is one of the most important sectors in the tourist activity in Portugal. Knowing the characteristics and features of the hotel units operating in Portugal is important for all those who make decisions about investment in this sector. Knowing the reality of brand affiliation of Portuguese hotel establishments is also a matter of great interest for hoteliers in supporting strategic decision-making. Performing the analysis of the universe of hotel establishments in Portugal, their characterization is made concerning their features, facilities and equipment. In addition, the reality of brand affiliation of Portuguese hotel establishments is analyzed and discussed through a logistic regression model. The results allow us to conclude that just over a third of hotel establishments in Portugal are brand affiliated and they are mostly located in the more touristic regions. The results also show that brand affiliated hotel establishments have, on average, a greater number of stars, greater capacity and a greater number of facilities than non-brand affiliated hotel establishments.
