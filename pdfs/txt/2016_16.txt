MinaAcces: Information system for access control in mining center
ABSTRACT
Technological infrastructure and mines in Colombia conditions do not meet the standards, promoting events that endanger the lives of miners. This paper presents the design and implementation of an information system for access control and management of priority information in a central mining exploitation. The developed system allows to control the access of the miners, with alarms that warn of possible people trapped in the mines. The software has two applications (Web and Windows) designed in Visual Studio and the database in Microsoft SQL server, which interact with the hardware part, consisting of RFID devices for personnel identification, XBee modules for remote transmission and drivers arduino. The system was designed for the American mining company Coal Colombo in order to automate information management and process control access on its premises.
