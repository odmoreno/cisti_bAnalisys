Comune â€” An android application for applying surveys to and collecting reports from public service users
ABSTRACT
Public administration faces expressive daily challenges in its attempt to assist every citizen who relies on public services. Precise and updated data that allows the identification of people's expectations and needs, may be valuable on the elaboration and management of successful public policies. To make data collection a more practical and extensive process, this paper introduces a Mobile Public Participation Geographic Information System for the Android platform. The application uses geospatial technologies to plot points on a base map, with each point representing a real public establishment that users can interact with by leaving comments or answering to available surveys.
