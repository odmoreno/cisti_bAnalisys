Exploring the relationships between executive management, success of information systems and performance in educational organizations
ABSTRACT
This article presents the preliminary results of a study that has as objective to establish if the executive management affects the success of the information systems used in the management processes, and the latter affects the organizational performance of educational organizations of primary and secondary education. For this purpose, surveys were applied to key informants who use and / or know the information systems available to support the management of their institutions in Chile. The results obtained indicate that factors associated with executive management affect the success of information systems, but the effect of this success on their performance is low.
