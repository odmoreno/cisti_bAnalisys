Innovation in radiotelevisi칩n espa침ola: An approach to the creation and distribution of fiction contents in the digital environment
ABSTRACT
In a media ecosystem characterized by the increase of competitors, the audience fragmentation and the critics about the lack of independence of public service media, European televisions must redefine their mission, giving value to their public service exercise in the era of convergence. In this sense, public corporations face the challenge of integrating their traditional models and operating logics with more innovative ones derived from technological changes driven by digitization. This article analyses how Radiotelevisi칩n Espa침ola applies product and process innovation to its fiction series in order to elucidate the strategies that public Spanish TV is developing in terms of content production and distribution.
