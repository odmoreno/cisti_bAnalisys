Development of an interactive book with Augmented Reality for mobile learning
ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality has brought significant contributions to the field of Education. This technology transformed learning in a more motivating, enjoyable, fun and interesting activity. This paper presents an Augmented Reality application for mobile devices that complements and supports learning of geometric figures. The application, called AGeRA, consists of a geometry book and software capable of reading special markers inserted into the book's content. When this book is placed in front of the camera of a mobile device, 3D objects, sounds, animations and other interactive elements, leap from its pages making learning more fun and exciting. Preliminary tests were made with teachers and students and showed good acceptance of the application to support geometry teaching.
