Framework for an Intelligent Operations center: Architecture of decision support information system
ABSTRACT
When a huge event occurs it is necessary the alignment between at least two command centers, one connected to the civil protection and the other focused on safety. The communication and coordination between both command centers it is crucial, because it improves the coordination and therefore the decision making process. This paper presents the design and implementation of a technological framework based on IBM Intelligent Operation Center, where the required procedures were mapped. A real scenario was used to demonstrate and to evaluate the proposed solution. The obtained results prove that this solution improves the efficiency of decision making process, reducing the time decision and the involved resources.
