Data Quality Problems Identified in the Bioclimatic Data Collection Process - A Survey
ABSTRACT
Bioclimatic data support several researches that aim to identify the influence of climatic factors on biodiversity on the planet. In order to make these studies possible, the quality of the data that supports the analyzes must be guaranteed from the beginning of the data life cycle so that the results and models generated reflect the real scenario of the investigated phenomena. However, the collection of climate and biodiversity data presents significant challenges. This work performs a survey of the main quality problems identified in the bioclimatic data collection process. The methodological procedure consisted in identifying the problems, assigning the data quality dimension affected, and suggestions for possible solutions to the problems. The results of this survey showed that ambiguous methodological procedures during the data gathering and human interference are important factors for data quality impairment and the information obtained from these data. Thus, the correction of the data should focus on the collection processes and procedures, not the raw data itself.
