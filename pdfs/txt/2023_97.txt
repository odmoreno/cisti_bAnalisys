Grid Computing: Main Tools Identified in Scientific Research
ABSTRACT
New technology demands high-performance computing to solve organizational issues. Every day, tons of data are generated, so constant analysis of these data is necessary, requiring more powerful computers. However, all this demand requires technological investments resulting in an increase in costs and some cases the need for supercomputers. In order to solve such problems, the use of Grid Computing is already a reality as they use low-cost computers that perform tasks in distributed and heterogeneous systems. As it is a relatively new technology, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate which tools are already more consolidated with the use of Grid Computing. The paper describes, through literature review, the most mentioned tools, frameworks, and platforms for Grid Computing in the analyzed articles.
