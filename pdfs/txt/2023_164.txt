Platform for the recognition of people and their emotions for SMEs and Startups
ABSTRACT
Industry 4.0 refers to profound changes driven by advances in technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and others, which will be experienced by industries and society. Facial recognition has allowed for advancements with increasingly more applications in the fields of security, finance, education, and social security. This technology opens opportunities for SMEs (Small and medium-sized enterprises) and startups to develop new products and services with a high technological component. SMEs and startups require high scientific and technical knowledge in implementing this type of technology.We propose a hardware-software multiservice platform in the cloud for facial recognition of people and their emotions for SMEs and startups. This platform will allow SMEs and startups to identify the main algorithms for facial recognition. In addition, they will have the opportunity to evaluate facial recognition models. They could also train such models with different available data sets. Preliminary results are shown of the configuration, training, and validation of two emotion recognition architectures (Resnet and VGG).
