Using Visual Resources to Assist in the Teaching-Learning Process of Operating Systems Through the Development of a Simulator
ABSTRACT
Tools like analogies, games and simulators have been used to facilitate the teaching of abstract concepts, providing a more playful environment that favors the teaching-learning process. Courses in technology area are composed of abstract concepts that are difficult to learn, such as the subject of Operating Systems. Thus, this work presents the SOSimulador development and evaluation, a visual tool developed to assist in the teaching-learning process of Operating Systems courses. This project was developed following the Software Engineering concepts defined in the agile methods and its validation was carried out with a case study, in which the participants evaluated the tool positively, with an average rating of 4.33 (between 0 and 5) points.
