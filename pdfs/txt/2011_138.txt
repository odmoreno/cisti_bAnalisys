Sustainable enterprise KPIs and ERP post adoption
ABSTRACT
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in general are currently experiencing an increasing interest from both the academic and business communities. This paper examines the relative influence of eight KPIs determinants and the use of ERP in Portuguese Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Through a web survey, data was collected and validated from 85 firms. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis was used to tests the hypotheses related with KPIs pertinent to the ERP post adoption. The results show that six of eight variables related with KPIs contribute to ERP usage and value. Additional, enterprise sustainability is a determinate to whether ERP system is used or not. This work is the first empirical research study that focus on sustainable enterprise KPIs. This is a synthesis of existing practice from Portuguese industry, consultancy and academia into a coherent framework for the achievement of sustainable performance and ERP post adoption.
