Psychosocial therapies through mobile phones with women victims of gender violence
ABSTRACT
We present the results of a biopsychosocial therapeutic intervention with a group of women victims of gender violence and long-term unemployed in Spain. Our research is a usability and pre-feasibility study of a remote psychosocial therapy system using mobile phones and text messages. For this we send automatic text messages to mobile phones with content based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in order to improve the physical, mental and social health of these women. The women participants were selected at random by the public social services of the Autonomous Government of Galicia, giving their informed consent to participate. Before starting the experience, we collect data through official social reports and conduct a face-to-face interview with each selected woman. The objective of the intervention has been to promote the biopsychosocial health of a pilot group of women victims of gender violence and diverse social pathologies such as drug addiction, mental disorders, prostitution or poverty.
