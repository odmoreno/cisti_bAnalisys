Comparing Web GIS systems for display and processing geographic information in the context of INDE
ABSTRACT
Visualization and processing of geographic information is an important part for a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). Choose the software system to accomplish this task is laborious and complex. To assist SDI implementers to define which systems should be used, this article analyzes some of the currently available systems and used by a variety of existing SDI in order to provide information for decision making in choosing the systems to be used in the SDI. The implementation of the SDI for TERRANTAR project evaluated the systems. This project aimed at providing geospatial data on the Antarctic continent, more specifically on the Brazilian government's area of operations. Communication modeling using Web GIS for dissemination and processing geospatial data made these analysis criteria.
