Comparing User Experience: An Analysis of Usability Testing Methods for Mobile Applications
ABSTRACT
Mobile devices and their applications have become integral in our daily lives, with people spending an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes on their phones each day. The growth in mobile applications has increased the number of interfaces that users interact with, making usability and user satisfaction crucial for their success. This paper aims to compare two usability testing methods, user observation and UMUX post-test questionnaire, in real usability testing sessions with various applications. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in measuring user satisfaction and determining the usability of mobile interfaces. Furthermore, since it was noticed that the results from these two methods are conflicting, we have developed a proposal for a usability questionnaire for mobile applications, so that it can be tested in the future.
