Criminal data mining: A case studyin Criminal Observatory Tapajós
ABSTRACT
Data mining allows research to reach patterns, often not visible by the simple observation of data. It is an exploration process in order to detect relations between the variables, seeking infer or create forecasts for future data. In public safety area data mining or MD, can be used in several ways: to identify the relation of a crime type with some neighborhood, determine the existence of a pattern for age, sex, day and the time that somebody commits some type of crime, among many other possibilities. The purpose of this article is to use MD technique in OBCRIT - Criminal Observatory Tapajós, which is a database that records reports of occurrences of the 3rd Battalion of Military Police of Pará State. The simulation results using Weka tool proposes to trace a profile of the occurrences that are part of the same group, finding common indications for the registered crimes and showing the importance of the use of data mining to in the process of extract knowledge to criminal levels.
