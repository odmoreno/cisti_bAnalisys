Business Intelligence Solution in Project Monitoring and Control
ABSTRACT
Due to the need to control and monitor the performance of projects and the inherent need for project managers to provide feedback on the status of their project(s), this study focuses mainly on the planning of a Business Intelligence solution, as an aid in the monitoring and control of projects. In this sense, the EVM (Earned Value Management) technique is used as a method recommended by PMBOK and it is effective in controlling and monitoring projects, to identify the best indicators and develop the proposed Business Intelligence solution for this research. Based on the questionnaires answered by project managers from different sectors and with different experiences, and based on the literature on EVM and dashboards, it was possible to formulate a Business Intelligence solution that allows project managers to evaluate, through a single screen, the status of their project(s). The developed dashboard refers to a dashboard of tactical typology, since its purpose is to measure progress and optimize the process through indicators of action and result, in summary / detailed form with the purpose of improving the analysis by a BI Portal.
