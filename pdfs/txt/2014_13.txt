Stakeholders analysis in the development of software projects for e-learning in university contexts
ABSTRACT
The success of an e-learning project depends largely on the quality of applications and tools used to support the learning process. Meanwhile, the quality of software depends largely on proper identification of stakeholders in the requirements stage in the development process. While there are studies that have identified key stakeholders in e-learning contexts, most of them do not perform a deep analysis of them, which is necessary to consider educational and cultural issues that set this type of environment. The aim of this paper is to present the application of a method for the analysis of stakeholders adapted to e-learning context considering university environments and showing a case study.
