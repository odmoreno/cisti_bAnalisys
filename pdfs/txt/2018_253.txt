Improvement of user experience methodologies through the application of gamification: I'm in methodology
ABSTRACT
The user experience is a discipline that links the user's interaction with the product and is related to the emotional reaction of the user. The initial evaluation methods were based on hypothetic-deductive systems, systems in which the same consultant established hypotheses to be solved based on the possible user behavior. These systems have been evolving towards a more active participation of the users making them part of the decisions and allowing a more active participation of the consultants during the test. The evolution of these methodologies is oriented towards the importance of taking into account the behavior of the user during the test session, making the evaluations more dynamic and more participatory. These sessions base their main objective on the results of the test and, therefore, on the pre-established and established behavior during the test. The study presented below is based on working the user experience as a discipline for evaluating user behavior, evoking the influence of emotions through the inclusion of gamification as a discipline to increase / improve experiences. This methodological proposal not only promotes the participatory design of the product, but also promotes user participation in the design of the test. The role of the consultant takes center stage in the face of the constant adaptation required by the new dynamic.
