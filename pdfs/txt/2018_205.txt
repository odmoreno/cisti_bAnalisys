Provision of next-generation personalized cyber-physical services
ABSTRACT
Cyber-Physical Systems are integrations of computation and physical processes. This new approach allows creating functional units with hybrid behavior, being able to perform new and complex actions. In this context, cyber-physical sensors are devices which, embedded in the daily living world, can monitor hidden variables by integrating software data analysis and physical sensing. With this information, a new generation of personalized services may be supported, as users can be provided with the content they need, although they are not aware of those necessities. In this paper a next-generation personalized service provision platform supported by cyber-physical sensors is proposed. Employed cyber-physical sensors include a mathematical model to extract information about the users' motivation. In this first implementation, motivational information is employed to offer adequate content to users in order to enhance their experience. An experimental validation is also provided in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed technology.
