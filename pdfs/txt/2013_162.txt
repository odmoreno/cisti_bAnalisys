Maintenance planning of building walls supported on Virtual Reality technology
ABSTRACT
In a building, the paint coating applied on interior walls presents an aesthetic roll and plays an important protective function. It is a building component exposed to degradation agents such as the use of housing, requiring a regular evaluation of its conservation status. The implemented model supports periodic inspections to the local and monitoring the maintenance of interior walls using Virtual Reality (VR) technology. On an inspection visit, the application allows to query a database formed by anomalies, usually associated with the coat of paint, the most probable causes and recommended repair methodologies. Additionally, the VR application accepts the assignment to each coating element monitored, a chromatic scale related to the degree of degradation, set according to the period of time between the dates of painting and repainting. The use of VR technology allows engineers to carry out inspections and evaluate the degree of wear of materials in a direct and very intuitive. The VR application constitutes a positive contribution in the field of construction, towards the use of it as an innovative technology with viewing and interaction capacities.
