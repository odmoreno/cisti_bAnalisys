CRUDi framework application â€” Insurance company case study
ABSTRACT
In general, managers have different opinions from those advocated by CIOs in relation to Information Systems, especially with regard to their importance and value to the business as well as in terms of investment needs. Here, we discuss and study new approaches to methods and tools for assessing the relative importance of each information system for business, focusing on the insurance companies. We applied the CRUDi Framework that introduces new key indicators for better decision support and to identify investment priorities, presenting results regarding the relative importance of each process to support the business strategy. The main contributions of this work are the CRUDi Framework Case Study of application in an insurance company, as a tool to improve alignment between business and IS strategies and the discussion of the achieved results.
