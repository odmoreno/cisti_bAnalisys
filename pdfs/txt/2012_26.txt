A multimedia information system to support the discourse analysis of video recordings of television programs
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the development of a multimedia information system to support the discourse analysis of video recordings of television programs. Although the TV system is one of the most fascinating media phenomena ever created by men, there is still a lack of information systems that allow an effective retrieval of TV information relevant to the discoursive analysis and evaluation of such content. Given this context, in an attempt to provide Brazilian TV researchers with computational tools to assist their research, as well as to contribute to the discussion towards turning viable the access to the TV collection developed in this country, this work proposes the development of a multimedia information system, with a partnership with the Brazilian open TV channel Rede Minas. The mentioned system is based on the Matterhorn framework, indexing and retrieval techniques of audiovisual information and a tool collection that allows the automatic evaluation of essential parameters on the discourse analysis of TV video. The architecture developed for the system involves the possibility of information retrieval based on content independent metadata, as well as content dependent metadata, which are determined through discourse analysis techniques and image and sound signal processing.
