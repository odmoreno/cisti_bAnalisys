Identification of Associated Factors to Ontologies in the Field of Knowledge in Software Engineering: Case Study for MOOC-Type Courses Factors For Ontologies in Software Engineering
ABSTRACT
In this paper, the findings obtained regarding the way in which systems engineering students interpret the field of knowledge in software engineering are presented. Based on a questionnaire on the interrelation of concepts, conceptual relationships are identified located in hierarchical clusters that allow ontologies to be established to interpret the way in which knowledge evolves in the training program. As a result, ten conceptual clusters are obtained which contrasted with the knowledge areas proposed by the theoretical referents, allow the identification of failures in the conceptual relationships in the Systems Engineering knowledge field for students from the first to the eighth semester in order to adjust MOOC-type courses to this needs.
