Using case-based reasoning into a decision support methodology for the incident resolution control in IT
ABSTRACT
With the increasing use of information technology (IT) within organizations, there was an increased need for support customers and its infrastructure, especially in calls for incident resolution. Decisions and actions are taken to repair and normalize the services caused by incidents. The process of efficient decision-making requires timing and standardization among all members of a team. Many organizations adopt Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) to structure and facilitate their decision-making. In turn, an important model of artificial intelligence, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), has aided the decision-making process using reasoning by analogy. This paper presents a decision support methodology described by a general decision-making process, aided by the CBR model, since ITIL does not propose resolution of incidents using analogy and IT environments rarely found standardization for reasoning by analogy. Thus, the aim is to facilitate decision-making and create standardization in the resolution of incidents considering reasoning by analogy. A prototype built with the framework JColibri served to validate the proposal of this work.
