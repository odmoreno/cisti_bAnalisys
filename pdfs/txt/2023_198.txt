Stochastic convergence of information and communication technology goods exports. Evidence for developing countries
ABSTRACT
This paper shows evidence of the existing differences between exports of information and communications technology (xtic) goods from 14 developing countries to leading economies such as Germany, China, South Korea and the United States. In this context, a panel model is considered to explain stochastic convergence through the use of panel unit roots and to determine whether there has been a decrease in external sector disparities in the aforementioned economies.
