A Review on Augmented Reality applied to Sports
ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality (RA) is gaining more popularity in several fields of application in the last decades. In this sense, this research aims to develop a systematic mapping review to reveal how this technology has been applied in the sports scenario. To achieve this goal, the researchers developed a systematic mapping protocol that returned 250 primary studies after applying the search String on the indexers Scopus and Web of Sciences. The Data Collect phase followed applying the exclusion criteria, reaching a consolidated inclusion of 171 studies to be analyzed and synthesized to answer the research questions. This review condensed the state-of-the-art of AR and sports areas, such as the areas and applications researched, tools/frameworks, input and output interaction styles most used, research gaps, and most common types of research.
