Application of the Open Archives Initiative protocols in scientific articles databases
ABSTRACT
Traditional search for a given subject, either through the use of search engines or by searching on portals to virtual libraries, proves to be a time consuming and inaccurate task. In general, this conventional type of search only covers HTML pages/results. The lack of standards for the provision of information and search on the Internet led to the development and promotion of protocols by the OAI (Open Archives Initiative), in order to provide simplicity and efficiency in the task of uniting digital repositories data. In this context it is intended to implement the OAI protocols in a scientific paper repository so that the content can easily be accessed by information aggregators.
