Morphology of cognitive communication 2.0 in Higher Education classroom
ABSTRACT
New forms of learning in the Cloud Learning Environment enable the design of activities and the creation of resources with potential to be used in the Higher Education classroom context. This paper aims to present the very satisfactory preliminary results that were obtained with the exploitation of a PowerPoint presentation integrating the Twitter microblogging tool in the Higher Education classroom. The literature was analyzed to determine the dimensions to be included in a questionnaire administered to graduate students from three different courses. The objective was to discuss the issue of cognitive communication in the classroom context, changing the perspective from one-to-many to the many-to-many one, with the mediation of technology in real time.
