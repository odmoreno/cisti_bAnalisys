State of the art of accessible development for smart devices: From a disable and not impaired point of view
ABSTRACT
The need and benefits of digital accessibility are evident and, with the current ubiquitous trends, the profits are hugely potentiated. However, the fast evolution is instigating some issues in this area's accessibility. To understand the conceivable impact of these issues' tenacity in society, general accessibility features are explained as a reasonable application for all parties. Nevertheless, the potential of ubiquitous computation in order to promote social integration of citizens with impairments is focused and elucidated. The benefits of applying so much effort on accessibility as well as on usability is asserted and related to universal design. Hence, in order to promote a more universal applications development, the mobile operating systems available in the market, which are more plausible to be chosen and used by people with impairments, are scrutinized and shown from a standpoint of a developer that has accessibility and usability concerns. The paper leads to the conclusions that ubiquitous computation may have power to nullify impairments but, to be assistive, several issues regarding the devices and the operating system that runs on them have to be taken in mind and considered.
