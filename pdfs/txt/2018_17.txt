Challenge-based Learning: A proposal to support the preparation of literature review
ABSTRACT
Active methodologies have emerged as an educational conception to deal with a new reality, transforming students into the main agents of their learning. One of these methodologies is challenge-based learning (CBL). The purpose of this article is to present the CBL's employment to support the foundation of research themes. At the macro level, CBL is a comprehensive philosophical approach that uses challenges to inform and guide strategic decision-making, curriculum development, and classroom practice. The CBL is adaptable to meet the needs of its context and it is divided into three interrelated phases: engaging, researching and acting. An example of CBL's employment is presented for the literature review report of a research topic.
