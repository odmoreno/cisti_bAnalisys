System for floor's modulation
ABSTRACT
Traditional building system generate high volumes of waste, the final disposal of these wastes is a latent, high-impact problem environment. The development and implementation of information systems in order to guide construction processes and reduce the volumes of waste material is a felt need today. In order to challenge traditional methodologies used in building systems and promoting technological innovations use with tools enabling management of building systems from the perspective of the reduction of construction waste. This paper presents an automatic system that calculates the modulated planes of materials for floor coverings and optimizes the material used in the coating of the same, further facilitates the generation of modulation levels of each of the pieces that require cuts, size and location in the areas defined by engineers and architects inside of construction buildings.
