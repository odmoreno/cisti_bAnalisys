BTTE â€” An automated timetabling software for Higher Education
ABSTRACT
Throughout an academic year, in every Educational Institution, a considerable number of days and human resources are spent trying to manually perform a task that can be automated and optimized - the creation of timetables. In a time where the need to reduce costs has become part of the day to day reality of all Educational Institutions, it is unthinkable to continue working with this kind of approach. The automatic creation of timetables for Education is one of the most studied problems by the scientific community. However, almost all studies have been based on very simplified models of reality, not having thus a practical application. This paper presents an automated and optimized generator of timetables and the results obtained with its use under real conditions.
