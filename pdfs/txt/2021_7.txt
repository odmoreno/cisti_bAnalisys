GuitarEasy - An Interactive Approach to the Study of Music Theory
ABSTRACT
The study of music theory is considered by many to be difficult and uninteresting. In part, this happens because the self-taught or enthusiastic musician usually focuses only on the practical part of the music, wishing to be able to play a particular song only by memorizing the chords and notes necessary for that specific situation, without worrying about the theoretical part behind the music. In addition, some methods adopted in schools and even music colleges are out of date, being far from the student's expectations. This work aims to use technology to assist the study of music theory with the creation of an interactive and didactic system, consisting of a musical computational artifact named GuitarEasy, in which students of all levels will be able to visualize the theoretical aspects easily.
