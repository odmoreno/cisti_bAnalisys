Managing team work submissions in large moodle courses in order to generate course portfolios
ABSTRACT
Massification of higher education institution promotes the importance of peer education and team work as important educational tools. As such, teams frequently produce several deliverables that should be organized and evaluated throughout a given course. Some submissions should then be attributed to the team rather than the individual and searching for a given type of deliverable from a given team becomes an important concern in terms of organization and ease of usage in evaluating assignments. The course “Projeto FEUP”, used as case study and surely many others benefit from an at-least partially automated production of an organized set of all deliverables from a given course in a given year - a course portfolio, a task made easier by the usage of the presented ideas and the prototype implemented in the Moodle Learning Management System. This article shows details of the implementation and the lessons learned. The prototype was tested in the mentioned test course that has about one thousand students enrolled and a course portfolio was successfully created.
