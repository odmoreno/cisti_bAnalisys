Contemporary challenges in legal informatics: Workshop INJU
ABSTRACT
Legal informatics has seriously transformed the practice of law over all aspects, especially in the court activities and bringing actions to enforce rights. This has generated a trend towards law integration and uniformity on legal proceedings. This requires frequent updates on regulatory laws due to first advances of CIT. In this paper we present contemporary challenges on legal informatics and how main contributions of the Workshop INJU meet them. The Workshop includes three presentation about documental informatics: a study on Traceability of the law from Chile, another study of document management from Peru and third one from Denmark which describes a software tool that provides access to relevant court information without affecting privacy. Also the workshop includes an experience on the implementation of electronic management of Tribunales Populares Cubanos.
