Agile software development for mobile applications and wireless interaction with hardware development board (Arduino)
ABSTRACT
This research is focused on searching for an application to be used in the agile development of mobile applications. In this context, the Mit App Inventor 2 application was selected, and as a basic methodology for the development of mobile applications the choice was Dr. Mobile. A practical example is presented with the interaction in a wireless environment (by Bluetooth) with the hardware development panel Arduino UNO. It has been found that the interaction between the application created and the Web App Inventor portal works perfectly with the Arduino hardware development board and its HC05 Bluetooth module, since the sending and subsequent receipt of the parameters are effective and the response time is very fast.
