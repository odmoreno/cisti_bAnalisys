An approach password graphic for access control web
ABSTRACT
This article describes the research of an innovative approach to innovative graphical password model that supports secure authentication in Web systems and wants to solve the shoulder spy problem. To this end, we developed a graphical password model based on two elements: a Web page image that the user has opened in the moment of its enrolment, and strokes drawn with dimensions, directions, and sequences of user choice's. In an exploratory study with participants to validate shoulder spies perceptions, it was found that are more difficult when a user is logging in using a graphical password, than when using an alphanumeric password. The model was designed iteratively and user-centered. To validate its safety and usability, they were made several tests with participants. In these studies, we tried to understand the degree of effectiveness and memorization provided by this password graphical model to users in Web authentication. The results showed that we got a usable and secure solution with potential to be used as an alternative to alphanumeric password, against the shoulder spy in Web authentication.
