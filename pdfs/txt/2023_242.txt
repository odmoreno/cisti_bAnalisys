Proposal for Fostering Innovation in the Southern Agreste of Pernambuco : The case of the Locus of Innovation Program in Garanhuns
ABSTRACT
Based on the assumption that innovation is one of the important elements for the development process of a given location, this article seeks to discuss the process of implementing a public policy (Programa Lócus de Inovação) within the state of Pernambuco, specifically in the municipality from Garanhuns. Methodologically, it is a descriptive research with a qualitative approach, which used the semi-structured interview procedure for data collection, and content analysis for the interpretation of the findings, through the redesign of the Innovation Promotion Map suggested by Acies Consulting Group, Braithwaite Global Inc (ABGI). Among the main results, it is highlighted that the project, still in its initial phase, has characteristics that point to the future constitution of a Local Innovation System, but for this to happen, it is necessary to have greater action by the local public power in support and not promotion of the idea presented by educational institutions, as well as involvement of local companies.
