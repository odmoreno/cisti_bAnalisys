STEM and Robotics in Elementary education: a teacher's view to a classroom experience
ABSTRACT
The following study seeks to identify noteworthy elements of the educational project that is implemented by students and teachers of elementary education a technological proposal that allows a greater understanding of topics related to science and mathematics, thus increasing the interest, motivation of students and teachers, instilling from very early stages in areas related to STEM. The general research questions addressed the objective of the study: What are the conceptual and methodological changes evidenced in the students with respect to STEM work after completing the workshop as seen from the teachers' perspective? And What attitudes do teachers observe in students after the development of the CISOGRA workshop and the approach to teacher practice? The research technique was a semi-structured interview using a script that includes a series of questions that have been used in a flexible way. A content analysis was carried out, using a system of categories constructed in a deductive and inductive way. In relation to the results of the variables of the coded documents, we found that the frequencies and their respective % correspond to a total of 184 catalogued segments, being the category of "Valuation of the project as a didactic proposal" the one that marks a predominance with 78 segments, followed by the category of "Impact of the project towards the attitude of science and mathematics" with 56 coded fragments. In this way and as the teachers interviewed commented, this does not remain only in robotics classes, but the children take it to the classroom, their daily life, being able to internalize working with other people because they know the importance of teamwork and the multiple solutions to a problem.
