Dynamic capabilities, marketing and innovation capabilities and their impact on competitive advantage and firm performance
ABSTRACT
The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of dynamic capabilities (DCs) on competitiveness and performance of companies, considering the mediating role played by marketing capabilities (MCs) and innovation capabilities (ICs). The investigation of these effects is performed considering the moderating role of ambidexterity on the proposed relationships. This investigation advances a theoretical model tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). A 90-item questionnaire exploring the relationships between DCs and marketing and innovation was developed, and a total of 387 valid questionnaires were collected from a sample of Portuguese enterprises. The results show the existence of a positive direct and indirect influence of DCs on competitive advantage and performance variables as well as a direct impact on MCs and ICs. This study contributes to filling the gap in the existing research on the direct impact of DC's variables on competitive advantage and performance by considering mediating role of MCs and ICs.
