A network sensor for medical imaging workflows
ABSTRACT
The usage of information systems has significantly augmented in the last years and healthcare is not an exception. The growing use of computer systems has increased the productivity and quality of services provided by medical institutions. These systems can generate a huge amount of information and it is possible to identify several tools to process and analyze it. However, there are few systems that allow users to aggregate data from various systems, in a centralized manner, and correlate multiple source information. Moreover, there are some sources that usually are not analyzed but their usage could help us to optimize existing resources and ensure the quality of services provided. This paper presents a tool to capture and analyse the information exchanged on a medical imaging network. This sensor colects network packets and enables the user to extract knowledge from them and associate email alerts to certain events.
