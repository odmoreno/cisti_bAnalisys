Intelligent Heterogeneous Transportation System in Quito city under the paradigm SWE-SOS standard and loT notifications
ABSTRACT
Transport plays a fundamental role in the economic development of a country, since it makes possible the distribution and integration of the necessary resources to promote the aforementioned technological, economic and social growth. Quito, the capital of Ecuador, presents serious mobility problems, with a significant amount of traffic both in the city center and in its main access routes. The proposal detail ed in this article aims to link Quito with several new generation technologies such as : Internet of Things (IoT), the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard for communication of heterogeneous sensors, and a system of notifications in real time using the protocol Communications Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). These technologies will be used for the development of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) that will take advantage of the mass deployment of smartphones in society as main sources of information, and also include Arduino and Raspberry modules to verify efficient communication. This ITS bases its operation on the crowsensing paradigm, which allows to reflect with greater accuracy the reality of the object of study, the more collaborators use the system; reaching up to 30% improvement in the situational awareness of the environment variable, traffic.
