The Representation of Older People in Animated Films: Proposal of an Analysis Grid
ABSTRACT
The elderly population faces challenges related to ageism and the media have an important role in the construction, perpetuation and deconstruction of the stereotypes related to this phase of life. Children are especially sensitive to images transmitted by the media and animation films constitute a privileged content by this public and can have a strong influence on the way they understand the world. Identifying and analyzing the representation of older people in animated films can be an important tool to understand how animated films represent the aging process and the elderly, which represent a strong influence on the child and adolescent public. In order to carry out the analysis of these representations, we present the proposal of an analysis grid, which results from the adaptation of the analysis grid developed and used in previous studies.
