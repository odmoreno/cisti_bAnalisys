Blended Mobile Learning Context Oriented Model applied to the teaching of computer networks
ABSTRACT
Computer networks are present in any undergraduate courses at the computer science and computer engineering, electronics and computers areas. Therefore, tools to help the teaching / learning process in these areas have arisen. At the same time it could be observed an evolution of the teaching / learning process with new models and an increasing use of mobile devices in some of these models. This paper describes an evolution of the BML - Context Oriented Model in teaching / learning process at an early stage of learning. This proposal is based on open source software, given the technical and economic constraints. The learning context in general and in particular, the time and place of use are important factors in the model, this is because of them depend on the type of material available to the student.
