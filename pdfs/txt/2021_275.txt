Environmental tourism Kuznets curve and R&D Expenditure in South America
ABSTRACT
This investigation shows evidence of the relationship between environment pollution, expenditure on R&D and international tourism. In order to show this relationship, we used panel data from 5 south American countries. Results show that the tourism environmental Kuznets curve does not hold for South America, tourism reduces CO2 emissions, and its square increases the emissions. The expenditure on R&D increases the emissions, nonetheless, renewable energy consumption does reduce CO2 emissions. As recommendation, we highlight the importance of tourism industry in the short run to reduce the CO2 emissions, however, itâ€™s necessary to increase ecotourism because in the long run tourism might increase the emissions.
