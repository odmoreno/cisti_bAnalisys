Application of technological tools Youtube and Zoom in the teaching-learning process of fifth grade students of the Basic General Education School "Gral. Manuel Serrano Renda" del Cant√≥n El Guabo
ABSTRACT
In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the teaching-learning process moved to a virtual modality, experiencing changes in teacher-student interaction, for which it was necessary to use technological tools, such as YouTube and Zoom, the which became the most used due to their accessibility and diversity of collaborative functionalities. The objective of this work was to determine the application of the technological tools YouTube and Zoom, as interactive resources in the development of the teaching-learning process of a primary institution in Ecuador. For this, a case study is presented, where a quantitative methodology was applied, with a descriptive-correlational type of study, considering the total population of fifth grade students to whom a previously structured survey and interviews with teachers were applied. In this context, it is concluded based on the results that the use of YouTube and Zoom contribute significantly to the teaching-learning process, however, little knowledge is reflected in the teachers regarding the use of its functionalities, which compromises the adequate development of the apprenticeships.
