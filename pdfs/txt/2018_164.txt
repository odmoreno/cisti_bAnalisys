Big Data analysis tools in IoT and their challenges in open researches
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolution of the current Internet in a ubiquitous network of interconnected devices. The continuous transmission of raw data flows by these devices to the IoT network is voluminous, generating terabytes of data continuously. However, the analysis of this massive data requires many efforts at multiple levels for the extraction of knowledge and decision making. Therefore, Big Data Analysis is a current area of research and development that has become increasingly important. This article investigates the potential impact of major data challenges, cutting-edge research efforts aimed at analyzing IoT data, and various tools associated with its analysis. As a result, this article suggests the use of platforms to explore Big Data in numerous stages and to better understand the knowledge we can draw from the data, which opens a new horizon for researchers to develop solutions based on open research challenges and topics.
