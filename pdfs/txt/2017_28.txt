Brand followers on facebook perceptions and behaviours
ABSTRACT
Social networking websites are increasingly used as tools to communicate between people, whether these consumers or companies. Facebook is one of the most users platforms in the world and is also highly valued as a communication tool by companies. In this field, the present research establishes several factors of interest to contemplate in the creation of a communication strategy in Facebook, focusing mainly on the coffee and pastry sector. The main results indicate that the determining factors that contribute to a good communication strategy are, in particular, the attention to detail of the shared contents and the care in maintaining close communication with the client, not forgetting the regular sharing of contents. The results obtained allow us to present some communication proposals, in a publication format, for the brands under study.
