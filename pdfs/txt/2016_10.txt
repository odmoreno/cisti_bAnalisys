Health informatics for indoor air quality monitoring
ABSTRACT
Indoor environments are characterized by the existence of various pollutant sources. Moreover, at present, people spend more than 90% of their time inside buildings. Thus, the indoor air quality is undoubtedly a key factor to be controlled to ensure the health and comfort of the occupants. Most of the air quality monitoring systems on the market are very expensive and only allow to collect random samples. This paper describes iAQ, a monitoring system that uses a low cost wireless sensor network, to collect indoor air quality information. This system was developed using Arduino, XBee modules and micro sensors, for storage and availability of monitoring data in real-time. This data can be accessed through a Web portal and through a Android mobile application requiring only an internet connection. Five sensors are used for the acquisition of environmental parameters (air temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and luminosity). Other sensors can be added to monitor specific pollutants. The results show that the indoor air quality may be, in some cases, quite different than expected values. The proposed system can provide effective indoor air quality assessment in order to avoid the risk of exposure to pollutant sources.
