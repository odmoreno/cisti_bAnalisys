Business Process Management as a driver for Digital Transformation : A case study in a higher education institution
ABSTRACT
Digital transformation of the organization's processes accelerated in recent years and boosted with the Covid-19 pandemic. Digital transformation usually implies process changes and leads to increased automation of flows, which results in many benefits. In this scenario, the use of business process management systems presents clear advantages due to the speed of implementation and, above all, the ease and rapid adjustment of digital support to changes in business processes. To concretely evaluate the benefits of adopting business process management systems in higher education, it was carried out a case study based on the implementation of an internal process on a business process management system, and the subsequent completion of a user survey. The survey, based on the ISO/IEC-25010 quality standard, concluded that the process implemented under the case study is significantly better in terms of quality of use.
