Monitoring Security Risks of Teleworker Devices in Hospital Institution
ABSTRACT
The massive and urgent adoption of telework during the Covid-19 pandemic, supported by information and communication technologies, implied an increasing number of risks in the security of the digital infrastructure of the institutions, due to potential vulnerabilities in personal devices used by teleworkers. In this paper, this problem is raised in the context of a public healthcare institution, whose IT team was unable to monitor in real time and in an automated way the security status of these devices, nor security incidents that had been targeted. Several endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to mitigate this problem were researched, analyzed and tested. A validation experiment was conducted with teleworkers that allowed the selection of an effective and affordable centralized solution to solve the problem raised in this research.
