HyFlex, hybrid and flexible model for university education: Case study: Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja — Ecuador
ABSTRACT
In this paper we review the features of the HyFlex experience and study at the Technical University of Loja (UTPL) in its implementation. The HyFlex model is accepted as an innovative proposal that gives courses Blended Learning new features of flexibility and adaptation with respect to the availability of space and time of the students as well as their way of learning. Our research was mainly oriented towards two issues: the description of the model and case study. These aspects will conclude on an assessment of strengths and weaknesses of HyFlex and strategies for its implementation. Thus, the case study of the UTPL has been positive, but some obstacles have been identified for implementation, mainly related to teacher training. There is little research on HyFlex model but further investigation of these practices is necessary to have sufficient information to assess the relevance of its application in the global context.
