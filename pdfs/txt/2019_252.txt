Interactive audio novel: A Story and Usability preliminary study
ABSTRACT
In this article we present a game interface, using audio input and output, aiming to provide the concept of interactive narrative to users with visual or motor disability. The solution lets users choose the direction of the story, triggering several alternate endings and thus creating a dynamic and creative narrative. The application development process is described here from the design, implementation and evaluation. In the evaluation phase, we performed user tests with five participants with visual and motor disability. Thus, we record three metrics: effectiveness, success of the task (reaching one of the possible endings); efficiency, time needed to complete the story; and satisfaction, comfort and wellbeing of the user during the interaction. The result was positive, all participants successfully completed the application, and there were no withdrawals. Four in five wanted to repeat the experience and try to reach another end of the story.
