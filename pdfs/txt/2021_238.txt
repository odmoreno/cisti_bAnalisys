Impacts of COVID-19 in Retail: A Case Study Research
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research is to discuss the possible impacts and mitigation measures that emerged in the retail sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a qualitative and exploratory case study of a Portuguese logistic operator, we explored the effects of the pandemic on employees daily work. To that end, we used several sources of data collection, such as semi-structured interviews, analysis of official documents and direct observation. The results showed that the logistic operator is adopting several measures and practices to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, such as: 1) use of telework; 2) protection and hygiene measures for employees and customers; 3) tools to respond to growing demand for non-perishable goods, hygiene/cleaning products and tobacco; 4) policies that enhance digital transformation; and, 5) the use of active and preventive communication strategies. Of all the adopted measures, we highlight the digital transformation, due to its potential positive impact in allowing the return of a new normal. This normality is largely achieved by the use of innovative technologies that allowed remote work in practically all departments of the organization. This organizational change improved the paradigm we were used to, as it allowed to build new beliefs regarding the positive impact of teleworking and other opportunities for remote work, without significantly changing the expected service levels. In short, this article contributes to the dissemination of measures and practices adopted by retailers in Portugal, without neglecting the safety and competitiveness of labor practices.
