Emotion & stress mapping: Assembling an ambient geographic information-based methodology in order to understand smart cities
ABSTRACT
A smart city aims to improve urban functions and provided services, being often perceived as a living urban fabric, in which connected urban citizens, acting as active sensors, have the capacity to contribute even more efficiently to the spatial intelligence of cities. This “immaterial” dimension is related with the need that smart cities have to assess their citizen's feelings, perception and well-being, giving rise to an emotion-aware city. Mapping emotion builds on a tradition of studies in cognitive mapping, evaluative mapping, environmental preference and environmental affect, adding an approach in which people experience, evaluate and describe their environment “in situ” through social media. This paper aims to present an Ambient Geographic Information (AGI) approach to assemble geo-tagged data from Twitter, Flickr, Instagram and Facebook related with people's perception and feelings regarding Lisbon (Portugal), and therefore characterize its emotional dimension, by comparing these subjective observations with objective measurements (such as socio-demographic statistics, questionnaires and data retrieved from biometric sensors). With this vision of a smart city, that is capable to interpret and harnessing the emotional states of its citizens, it is essential to find new methods and techniques to sensing affect in an urban context.
