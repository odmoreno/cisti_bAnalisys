Identifying interaction strategies in ubiquitous learning environments
ABSTRACT
Adaptability in ubiquitous learning environments has been widely discussed in the literature and a challenging point is focused on the perception of users' profile and what strategies can be offered to keep them motivated to learn. Thus, it is necessary to identify interaction strategies based on the principles of ubiquitous learning (u-learning), especially those associated with learning situations in informal contexts. For this, it is essential to understand the aspects associated with the characteristics of the users, as well as the context in which they are. This work aims to characterize the process of identifying the user profile in u-learning environments, so that it is possible to design learning experiences that allow to become flexible its application in different situations.
