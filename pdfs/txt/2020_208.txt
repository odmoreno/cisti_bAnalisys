Migration of control system data to a system profibus and profinet devices for H&K Omega Lavana bottle washing machine 345
ABSTRACT
This research consisted of the development and implementation of an updated communication architecture design of the H& K OMEGA LAVANA 345 bottle washing equipment. This development will guarantee a safe, reliable and modern industrial control system that will facilitate the operation of the equipment, in turn reducing the time lost in production by minimizing the late identification of faults and improving the reliability and safety of the machine. The motivation originated from the lack of spare parts in the market for the replacement of communication components damaged due to obsolescence and in units that have had more than 20 years of operation. With the implementation of the proposal, it was possible to reduce the average steam consumption by 1400 kg/shift, which is equivalent to 10.86% less steam used per shift generating a decrease in operating costs, demonstrating that the new control loops allow finer adjustments, which was not the case with the old controllers.
