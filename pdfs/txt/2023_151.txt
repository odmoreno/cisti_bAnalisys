Smart Dashboard for Hoffmann Reflex Analysis
ABSTRACT
The Hoffmann reflex is a is a neurophysiological test that provides insight into the functioning of the human nervous system. It is commonly used in clinical and research settings to evaluate the modulation of the monosynaptic spinal reflex. This paper focus the analysis of the Hoffmann reflex in the trapezius muscle, a muscle of particular interest for researchers and clinicians due to its importance in upper limb function and dynamic stability. However, the Hoffmann reflex analysis of this muscle bring some challenges as the need of applicating burst of electrical square impulses in each current intensity. A web-based smart dashboard, implemented in Python, which allows the user to visualize and analyze the Hoffmann reflex using various signals acquired through a constant current stimulator. The dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that facilitates the selection of muscle signals of interest, analysis cycles, and start and end points for the signals. The visualizations offered by the dashboard, including overlapped and mean signal graphics, provide valuable insights into the Hoffmann reflex and its properties. Preliminary experiments with field experts and physiotherapists have yielded positive feedback on the usefulness of this tool, as they seek to gain a deeper understanding of the Hoffmann reflex, and we plan to further improve its capabilities in the future by employing machine learning techniques to automate the reflex detection.
