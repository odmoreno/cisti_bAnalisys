ABSTRACT
With the growth of the video game industry, interest in video game research has increased, leading to the study of Serious Games. Serious Games are generally perceived as games with purposes other than mere entertainment. These purposes range from education to training, marketing to design, among others. By exploiting the potential of these virtual worlds, we can provide the possibility to experience situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience in the real world, mainly due to reasons of cost, safety and time. Web browsers can now provide easy access to realistic virtual worlds with WebGL, which grants video game developers the tools to create compelling and rich environments that can be used in the future by virtually anyone. This paper presents a prototype of a Serious Game developed with WebGL.
