Preliminary dimensions for a quality model of electronic local government services
ABSTRACT
The study presented in this article will serve as a basis for the development of a suitable methodology whose purpose is to evaluate the quality of Local e-Government services. Citizens expect quality public services, and their online dimension is no exception. The quality of these services should be analysed and accounted for, in order to maximize and develop strategies that improve the offered services, increasing the levels of satisfaction of their recipients. In this sense, this first study presents a list of preliminary dimensions for assessing the quality of electronic local government services based on the literature review and an empirical study based on interviews. Up to the present moment, we were unable to identify a service quality evaluation method particularly focused on Local e-Government, and this justifies the development of an investigation project whose main purpose is to create a methodology in this field.
