Trilho Verde: Enhancing field trips with mobile learning
ABSTRACT
In this article we present a case study developed in the area of Mobile Learning where an interactive mobile application is used to support learning in the context of a field trip. This tool will guide students along a pre-established itinerary, notifying them of relevant locations found along the way. In each of these key places, a set of activities are presented in order to complement the information that can be inferred from the observation of some specific natural elements and/or to test the students' knowledge. With this work, we hope to contribute to the enrichment of the range of teaching/learning tools available to schools, especially those where resources are scarcer. The adopted developing methodology was the design science approach. The feedback received from the school during the Demonstration phase, where a first prototype was presented, was very positive, giving us the necessary motivation to improve the designed application and complete the last two phases of this approach in future work.
