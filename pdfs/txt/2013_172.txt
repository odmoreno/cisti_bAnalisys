ABSTRACT
Reading is an activity of high importance for our day-to-day. Every day and in all areas of knowledge, we need to read.

At the same time, has been witnessing to a major expansion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in schools Portuguese, given the importance they have for life in society. In this sense, this research aims to understand to what extent the performance of reading tasks, using books in electronic form, contribute to increased student motivation for reading. To support the research used a qualitative methodology (research-action), based on the implementation of learning tasks. As main sources of data collection for this research was chosen questionnaire survey, by observation/assessment of reading and the notes field. This research was developed under the stage of Practice Supervised performed in a school of the 1st cycle of basic education in the municipality of Castelo Branco with a group of twenty-five students attending the second grade in school year 2011/2012. Data analysis showed that students possess skills in the use of the computer and use it often alone activities in addition to their learning and play activities. The comparison between the initial reading and evaluation that was carried out after the implementation of the tasks with the use of digital resources (digital books using electronic presentation software) showed that there was a significant evolution of the performance of students in the reading in particular, some students whose reading assessment was initially negative.
