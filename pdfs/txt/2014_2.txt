Architecture of information system for monitoring of photovoltaic plants
ABSTRACT
The monitoring and supervision systems are crucial to the operation of photovoltaic plants (PV), allowing the gathering of data about its operation. This data, after proper processing, allow to obtain performance indicators, the establishment of comparisons, the identification of behavior trends, the detection and location of malfunctions in equipment / systems and the definition of optimized maintenance plans. The most obvious consequence of the use of monitoring and supervision systems is the improvement of the technical and economical performance of PV plants. This article presents an architecture of a system able to provide information about the operation of a PV plant, regardless of its size, in a mobile device. The proposed architecture includes important aspects concerning the design of information systems, namely concerning the system flexibility and security.
