Types of convergence in the Peruvian digital media ecosystem
ABSTRACT
This writing presents a set of characteristics of the Peruvian media ecosystem, focusing on the findings that show the level of media convergence from the presence of the news media in the digital environment. In the framework of the international project World Study Journalism, a methodological experience is presented to build a reliable database of the Peruvian media through the triangulation of public and pr√≠vate research sources. Likewise, this database has made it possible to identify the levels of technological convergence, audiences and media professionalism linked to the distinction between emerging centralist and peripheral media nuclei.
