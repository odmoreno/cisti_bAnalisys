Development of software prototypes through model game jam and basic vision artificial techniques
ABSTRACT
The artificial vision is a part of the artificial intelligence that pretends to simulate the human vision, is to say, from the acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation of images through an intelligent system. This work presents the creation of prototypes under the game jam model as a software product. In this context, the objective of the present work was to apply basic artificial vision algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), principal component analysis (PCA), Fisherface, Otsu, CamShift and color spaces such as RGB and HSV in order to be able to motion detection of objects, face recognition and pedestrian detection. As a result of applying this model in rapid prototyping, we found significant factors (such as: participatory design, light construction, product value approach, aesthetics and technology) in the implementation of innovative strategies in creating of prototypes focused on Software development.
