An eService platform for the assistance and support of primary caregivers
ABSTRACT
The increasing human longevity around the world calls for new attention models in which the primary caregiver plays a crucial role as a source of care supply. However, primary caregivers' lack of training, along with high levels of stress, depression and anxiety, can have a negative impact on both the caregiver's health and the development of caregiving duties. Hence, the objective of the present article is to introduce the eCuidador platform, an innovative tool that seeks to provide assistance and support to primary caregivers by means of a variety of services available in the cloud with the aim of improving caregivers' health and quality of life. Likewise, we present the results obtained from the pilot test validation, in which the evaluation of the following parameters was carried out: Usability (12), Functionality (10), Design (11), Usefulness (12) and Satisfaction (12). The participants of this pilot test were 12 primary caregivers (91.66% women).
