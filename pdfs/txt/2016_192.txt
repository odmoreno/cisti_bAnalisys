The use of Comic Books in the Software requirements specification
ABSTRACT
Some of the greatest challenges for Software requirements elicitation are related with the identification of what is needed to be developed and with the understanding of the organization business rules. In this context, this paper aims to suggest the use of Comic Books in the process of requirements elicitation within a business model and evaluate the results of applying this technique. To reach this target, authors proposed a scenario simulation method using Comic Books. Two experiments were applied to validate the proposal outlined in this paper. The first involved 8 professionals from a software development company and the second involved 17 professionals. All those professionals developed a comic book in order to map a business process within their work environment. In the end of the experiment, those professionals have answered a questionnaire, analyzing the comic books which had been developed. The results have been assessed in a positive way, showing thereby that the use of comic books facilitates the details and requirements elicitation process.
