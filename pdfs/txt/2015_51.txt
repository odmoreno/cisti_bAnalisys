An agile strategy for implementing CMMI project management practices in software organizations
ABSTRACT
The transition from traditional methods to agile project management methods and the changes needed to obtain their real benefits are difficult to achieve. Applying agile methodologies based on maturity models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) has been the focus of much debate in academic circles and in the software industry. Given the high and widespread rate of failure in adopting agility, and also arising from many of the reasons given to project management, this paper proposes a strategy for implementing agile project management in companies which seek to comply with CMMI by making use of the best practices of Agile Project Management and of the main agile methods and frameworks in a gradual and disciplined manner thereby contributing to the increased success rate of software development projects.
