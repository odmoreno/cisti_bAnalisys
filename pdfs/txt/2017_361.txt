The notion of public value in European public broadcasters: The cases of the United Kingdom, Austria and Germany
ABSTRACT
Since the publication of the 1995 fundamental work on Public Value Management, Creating Public Value, the theory promoted by Mark H. Moore has generated an interesting academic activity and has been applied to very different public management fields. This paper studies the implementation of public value in three European public broadcasters, paying attention to their context as well as to the definition built around this notion. In order to do so, it was developed a content analysis of the websites and reports from the public broadcasters in the United Kingdom (BBC), Austria (ORF) and the German region of Bavaria (BR).
