Public Value and Digital Government in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico: An Analysis of Official Websites
ABSTRACT
The concept of public value in public administration refers to the efforts made to carry out activities that benefit citizens. Governments worldwide have used information and communication technologies, including Digital Government, to establish connections with citizens in order to reduce corruption and encourage citizen participation, not only in terms of providing feedback, but also as active contributors to the development of public policies. Consequently, these efforts have led to improvements in internal work procedures within government offices. However, such improvements must be constant and contextually appropriate to be effective. This study aimed to identify the elements of public value present in the content of official websites of the Public Administration of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, through the use of a Delphi panel of experts and descriptive statistics.
