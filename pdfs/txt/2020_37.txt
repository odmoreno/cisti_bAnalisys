Virtual tool for the promotion of anaerobic conversion technologies of residual biomass in Colombian rural areas
ABSTRACT
The effects of climate change are more evident and destructive every year, because of this, investments in nonconventional energy sources are increasing rapidly and countries are reinforcing their policies to promote the use, research and implementation of new low-carbon technologies. With this in mind, this paper explores a software for estimating the biogas generation potential of livestock; and its use as a virtual tool to inform the inhabitants of Colombian rural areas of the energy potential of residual biomass with easy to understand indicators and comparisons. Results of the proposed software are based on reported data from scientific sources and results are identical to those calculated by traditional mathematical models. The authors expect to enhance the adoption of anaerobic digestion technologies by releasing this software through governmental, non-governmental and non-profit organizations.
