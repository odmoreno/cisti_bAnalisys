On modelling and evaluating the sport performance of high performing athletes by using WSN: An approach applied to football
ABSTRACT
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) perform a main role in the development of the Internet of Things, in addition, WSN is integrating several fields that require monitoring and control. On the other hand, in the last decade sports are integrating technology for its development. For this reasons this project presents a design of a theoretical model, in order to evaluate the performance of high performing athletes by using WSN, in addition, we present the results of the performance evaluation of athletes related to football by considering the speed as main parameter. The main results show that a midfield player reached the best velocity of 6.75 m/s, meanwhile a goalkeeper reached the worst with 5.49 m/s.
