Social media as a key tool in managing innovation un organizations
ABSTRACT
The innovation applied to business management has become a key element in the valuation of organizations in the global society environment, as well as their own survival in the markets in which they interact and in which it plays an essential role in the relationship of those with their audiences, while transcending the classic approach to the product to cover other areas such as procedures, communication, etc. Throughout the present century academic forums have given, through the presence in training programs and of the own research, a primordial role to the study and analysis of the innovation, mainly from the perspective of the transference of the knowledge. The present communication specifically addresses the basic delimitation of the state of the question in the framework of research and the role of social media in the monitoring of new demands made by consumers, which places them at a high level of study to be considered as a relevant support in the management of organizational innovation.
