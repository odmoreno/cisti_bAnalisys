Characterization of a Metric for Web Applications (Web Points)
ABSTRACT
Software estimation is crucial for any software project, since it ensures better planning and project management, which results in aspects such as timely deliveries, use of the right resources, and well-established budgets. Objectively measuring applications is an important concern from the perspective of improving the engineering approach to software development. This goal is related to improving estimates of the effort required to develop an application, but also to measure existing products. Currently, there are already several variations of software measurement metrics. Despite this, they cannot be classified as better or worse, since they have different purposes and respond according to what is intended to be measured. This article aims to propose a metric to measure the functional size of Web Applications (Web Points). For this purpose, a study was made in the literature on Software Engineering and existing metrics. The metric was then proposed and applied to Web applications developed in academic environment.
