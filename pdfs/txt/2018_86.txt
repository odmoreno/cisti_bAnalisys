Integration of cloud computing tools and knowledge bodies for the management of programming projects
ABSTRACT
A Body of Knowledge (BOK) is a set of concepts and skills that represent the knowledge of a specific area of engineering or scientific discipline and ensure their common understanding [1]. A BOK can include technical terms and theoretical concepts as well as best practices [2] so in this document we will focus on the context of software engineering specifically in Software Project Management. In addition, Cloud Computing will is becoming the best way to deliver solutions that meet the current need for greater collaboration between companies, education and society. In this context, the learning of Software Project Management is important during the professional life of Informatica since it entails transforming routine tasks into automated tasks, in the same way it will allow you to manage processes, focused on aligning the services of Information Technology (IT) to the needs of companies with an emphasis on the benefits that the final customer can perceive, adding the R + D + I factor to create an innovative product. The present work focuses on the integration of Cloud Computing tools (CN), application of Body of Knowledge in the area of projects in the context of software development. The tools of Computation in the Cloud analyzed were: Alfresco, Redbooth, DotProject which were integrated into Moodle of International University of Ecuador (UIDE). The use of these tools allowed obtaining information to formulate a body of knowledge in the context of projects as well as the respective digital portfolios.
