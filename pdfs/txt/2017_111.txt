Internet of things based on Android technology for people with disabilities
ABSTRACT
In the present project, a wireless connection (via Bluetooth) is made between a mobile device and a light control system, in order to manage the on and off of the domestic light. This application can be adapted to any electrical installation, only adding a Bluetooth touch panel, allowing the disabled people in the mobility, control the on and off of the lights of your home, regardless of where you are in your home, manage it from your own mobile device or from the touch panels installed in strategic places of your home. This application has been developed using the software autodesk circuit and bluetooth over Arduino, allowing this circuit can be managed or controlled from a mobile phone that has Android technology. In this way we take advantage of the advantages offered by the use of wireless connections (Bluetooth) in everyday life.
