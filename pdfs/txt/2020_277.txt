The use of e-banking by elderly people over 65 years: A Stdudy case at the council of Castelo Branco (Portugal)
ABSTRACT
Society is aging. At the same time, technological developments are such that the phenomenon of info-exclusion among the elderly originates. In the same vein, digital applications (app's) are more and more and increasingly replace services previously provided through a physical presence. E-banking is the perfect example of this phenomenon. Though this study, it was sought to know the opinion of elderly people over 65 years of age regarding applications directed to e-banking, realising their limitations. Thus, the methodology used was based on the structured interview technique (in order to understand the sociodemographic data), participant observation of the interaction with the app (with registration in the observation grid), field notes and focus group. This was applied to 5 elderly people who know how to read and write, in a day center in a location without ATM (ATM). It was concluded that although they consider the applications interesting, they prefer face-to-face service.
