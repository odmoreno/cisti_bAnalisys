University teachers and crisis e-learning : Results of a Polish pilot study on: attitudes towards e-learning, experiences with e-learning and anticipation of using e-learning solutions after the pandemic
ABSTRACT
The aim of the research was to show the conditions related to crisis e-learning in Poland from the perspective of the experiences of university teachers. The research was carried out by means of online questionnaire among 94 employees of the biggest Polish state pedagogical university. The survey used scales measuring attitude towards e-learning, anticipation of e-learning use after the end of the pandemic, and experience with e-learning before switching to crisis e-learning. The research was conducted between April and November 2020 and the quantitative findings are as follows: 1) The vast majority of academic teachers positively assess the opportunities arising from e-learning; 2) Two thirds of respondents indicate that blended learning is the most effective solution; 3) Almost two-thirds of the respondents state that e-learning allows all of the established learning objectives to be achieved; 4) Evaluation of e-learning is not a homogeneous phenomenon, so teachers differentiate between elements related to assessing the value of e-learning; 5) The only feature that differentiates the effectiveness of the assessment of e-learning is seniority (weak correlation); 6) More than two-thirds of respondents had no experience with e-learning before the outbreak of the pandemic; 7) Evaluation of the properties of crisis e-learning has an impact on the use of e-learning-based solutions after the pandemic.
