ABSTRACT
The aim of the current study is to describe ICT use in teaching process among a group of university teachers. Participants were 385 university professors enrolled in the School of Communication of a private university in Lima (Peru) which uses ICT within educational and management practice related with the teaching process. The ICT competencies was measured evaluating the skills in areas such as information literacy, Technology management, Research & innovation and ICT educational management. By contrast, professors required detailed training in the use of ICT teaching process. However, we suggested reviewing the constructive elements on the use of ICTs, the resistance encountered by participants and prioritization in monitoring and controlling the use of the tools by assessing in terms of advantages and disadvantages, including the required comprehensive framework conditions.
