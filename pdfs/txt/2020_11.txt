The community of communication researchers in Ecuador on the word scientific route : Who investigate and publish on communication in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
This work is a multimethodic study that makes a compilation of data related to the mediated history of the communication research process in Ecuador, based on the implementation of the Higher Education Law (LOES-2010). 161 researchers were investigated taking as reference some variables: subscription in the ORCID code, profile in academic Google, the notoriety and prestige contributed quantitatively by the H Index (academic Google) and finally, their postgraduate training and the relationship with the global context. The results suggest that the presence of researchers in Ecuador in the ORCID, Google Scholar and impact on the H index is in the process of germination, but still divergent with respect to the results recorded in other international university rankings of broader tradition. The universities that lead the process of visibility of research results are the UTPL, PUCE and UPS.
