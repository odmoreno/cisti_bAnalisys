Validation of an ERP system acceptance model among Latin American students: A longitudinal study in Chile and Colombia
ABSTRACT
Although Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been implemented and extensively studied in corporate contexts, there is a lack of research that focuses on educational contexts. This study begins to address this deficiency by validating the technology acceptance model (TAM) in an educational context to better understand the factors that influence students' intention to use ERP systems. The research model was empirically tested using data collected from students enrolled in ERP courses in two public universities in different countries at two points in time. The results of this longitudinal, cross-cultural study indicate that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness predicts behavioral intention, with perceived usefulness the strongest predictor. Contributions of the study and recommendations for future research are proposed.
