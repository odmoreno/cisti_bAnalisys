Practices organization before formalizing an acquisition contract according to the CMMI-ACQ model
ABSTRACT
CMMI-ACQ is a model that provides guidance to organizations on the acquisition of software products and related services. This paper addresses an organizational proposal that establishes the implementation sequences of the specific practices of the Solicitation and Supplier Agreement Development (SSAD) process area of CMMI-ACQ model. To achieve this, the “ORganización de los PRocesos de ADquisición (ORPRAD)” procedure is implemented. ORPRAD procedure represents the existing dependencies among processes area using the digraphs and find the strongly connected components and cyclic groups. These groups using formal criteria have helped to determine the implementation sequences of the acquisition processes areas at maturity level 2. Once the implementation sequence is obtained, the explicit dependencies and the prioritization of the practices within the SSAD process area are analyzed.
