Agile transformation processes: impact of factors in the success of failure : An ongoing work on identiying and charactering what influences transformations
ABSTRACT
Organizations are dealing these days with complex, demanding processes of transformation towards an elusive target generically known as Business or Enterprise Agility. Agile was born in the software realm, but after years of improvement and maturing is now a recipe for success across the different areas in organizations. But the transformation process towards Business Agility is not well known. We have individual experiences, detailed works about transformation in teams, some departments or some companies, and general surveys based in perception, not in objective data. This ongoing work is trying to identify the most relevant and impactful factors in Agile Transformation starting with the literature already available.
