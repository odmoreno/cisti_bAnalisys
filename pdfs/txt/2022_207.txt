Design of a low-cost technological alternative tool to assess the amplitude of the visual field, based on an empirical study
ABSTRACT
In Aeronautics, vision is the most important sense as it ensures all the passengerâ€™s safety. The pilot's ability to efficiently process the visual scene guarantees this safety. This paper presents a preliminary literature review that bases the design of a low-cost alternative technological tool that supports the assessment of the visual field amplitude. The design of the technological tool has been carried out applying the Kaur methodology. A virtual task was designed that will include three virtual environments: habituation, training and evaluation. Each virtual environment includes components, 3D objects and devices agreed with the specialists. The prototype will be developed using Unreal Engine and Blender free software tools. The software will integrate virtual reality devices for visualization and interaction. The prototype will be assessment following a defined validation protocol. The proposal could be a useful tool to contribute in one of the visual tests that are part of the pilot candidate selection process.
