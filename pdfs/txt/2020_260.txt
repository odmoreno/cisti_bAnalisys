Strategic Alignment Between Business and Information Technology in Companies
ABSTRACT
The incorporation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in public and private organizations allows to support processes, improve their performance, and provide quality services. However, there are a few organizations that achieve these benefits. Despite the existence of best practices and models of IT Governance (GTI), achieving the strategic alignment of business with IT is a straight line facing the CIO (Chief Information Officer). This article presents a Systematic Literature Review to determine the critical factors that influence strategic alignment between business and IT. A total of 11 articles were selected. The results show that the organizational structure of IT, understanding of goals, objectives, functions, and IT operations on the part of business managers, and the knowledge shared between business and TI are those who present the greatest frequency.
