Twitter Adverse Event Detection Using MetaMap for Brazilian Portuguese
ABSTRACT
With the tremendous technological transformations, biomedical information has grown exponentially. The World Health Organization (WHO), through pharmacovigilance notifications on Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and Adverse Events (AEs), has one of the largest databases in the world. However, it is not accessible to everyone. Due to the difficulty in accessing official databases, several works use ADR and AE information posted on social media as data sources for research. This information is essential for decision-making on certain drugs by health surveillance agencies. This work aims to detect EAs through Twitter. The approach uses the MetaMap biomedical program with the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) adapted to the Brazilian Portuguese language to map terms extracted from social media with medical concepts. The preliminary experiment made it possible to highlight the difficulties in using the MetaMap and specify the following activities.
