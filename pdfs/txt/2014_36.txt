Specifying BPMN diagrams with Timed Automata: Proposal of some mapping rules
ABSTRACT
The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) has come to be the most important result to standardize the notation for graphical representation of Business Processes (BPs). Nevertheless, BPMN models are not appropriate to support the analysis phase; do not have formal semantics to conduct qualitative analysis (validation and verification). In this work is introduced a set of guidelines to transform BPMN diagrams into Timed Automata (TA) networks (TA-networks) in order to make possible that business analysts and designers can perform evaluation (i.e., qualitative analysis) of BPs, based on the formal specification of BP-task model with TA. The application of the approach is aimed to evaluate the behavior of the BP-task model with respect to business performance indicators (for instance, service time, waiting time or queue size) derived from business needs. Also is shown an application example related to Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
