Development of a Graphical Interface for Continuous and Holistic Care Providers
ABSTRACT
The present work is framed by the research and technological development project `ActiveRest', which aims to develop a textile mattress guard to prevent pressure ulcers (PUs). This solution intends to integrate a monitoring system, based on a network of pressure, temperature and humidity sensors, together with a non-invasive actuation system that operates autonomously and locally, promoting immediate relief of pressure in critical areas. In addition, it is also intended to develop a mobile application, which continuously communicate with the mattress guard, allowing caregivers to be able to, at any time, consult the patient's condition. This article presents the work carried out under the digital technology component, namely the graphic design and programming work required to reach the solution presented. This solution will provide the means of interaction between the user and the mattress guard, in order to access the data generated by the device. In this case, the main focus was the design of a graphic interface, simple and adaptable to different target audience, facilitating their reading and interaction.
