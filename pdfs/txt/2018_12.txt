Case study: Methodology for the development of learning objects (OA) in 3D for applications of augmented reality (AR)
ABSTRACT
The present work aims to describe the methodology used for the development of learning objects (LO) in 3D for Augmented Reality (AR) apps, based on a combination of several methodologies used in the design of LO. The methodology consists of three components: 1) app scope, 2) content, and 3) technology. For the development of 3D LO, the prototype software development approach was used, where phases 2 and 3 are executed in each new version accompanied by the respective quality assurance. As a result of the implementation. The “Biologia AR” was gotten. To validate the resulting app from the methodology, a questionnaire, with 14 items, applied to 223 students was used. The results are that 89.30 percent, consider that the app content is in line with the bibliographic material used in the subject and 75.94 percent indicates that the contents of 3D LO used has allowed them to reinforce their learning. The 77.01 percent mention that the interaction with 3D LO is more didactic than with a plain text. Regarding the inconveniences to access the app, 52.47 percent mentioned that it had some type of inconvenience, mainly in download, installation and use, therefore, it is important to know the types of mobile devices in which the applications of AR is going to be used. Hence, it is guaranteed that the methodology allows AR consistent resources to be generated with the learning outcomes, without losing sight of the digital competences that professors and the students must have.
