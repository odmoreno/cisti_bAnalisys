Gamified tool to mitigate change resistance causes in software process improvement
ABSTRACT
Software development companies are interested in the implementation of best practices for facilitating their processes improvement with the purpose to increase the quality of their software products. However, software process improvement initiatives are complex because of look for modifying the conditions and behaviors of the professionals in charge of these initiatives. Therefore, exist a constant search of strategies for decreasing change resistance and gamification is one of the most used for helping to influence people's behaviors and contribute to reach the improvement goals. This work presents a web platform called the “Planetary exploration system”, where work team members can explore different worlds through mission accomplishment. Such missions allow winning points, achievements and experiences for ascending in the positions board and obtain virtual and real rewards. The platform can be integrated with software project management systems, incident management systems or support tools for other SPI processes.
