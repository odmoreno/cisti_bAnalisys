A propose for a federated ledger for regulated self-sovereignty
ABSTRACT
In a world where people must subject themselves to high scrutiny in every process they initiate, and in a world where the digital environment grows incessantly, we anticipate more online services asking for personal attributes and their need to trust in such attributes. For tackling such need, we will describe a proposal for a secure, decentralized and shared repository of certified personal attributes. Service providers, which are the entities that need to gather such attributes, can benefit from a proper certification by the entities responsible for them. The certifying entities can benefit, because they retain the power to revoke previously issued certifications. Finally, individuals benefit because they have full control over the disclosure of their set of certified personal attributes, namely to service providers, in order to assert their identity.
