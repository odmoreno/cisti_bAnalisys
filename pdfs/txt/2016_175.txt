Digital educational resources production in a Digital Tv studio: Training course for teachers
ABSTRACT
The research described in this article is one of the studies produced under the PhD in education from the first author, who aimed to analyze the design and development of Digital Educational Resources (DER) in a Digital Television Studio (DTS) from a High School. We used a research design inspired by the development methodology or DBR (Design Based Research). In this paper we describe the design and results of teacher training in-service course, accredited by the Scientific and Pedagogical Council of Continuous Training, in the context of Information Technology. This action sought to promote the practices of teachers in the design and development of DER using the resources of the DTS. We analyzed the videos produced by the teachers during the training course, we conducted individual interviews with participating teachers and we applied a questionnaire in order to assess teachers' opinions and satisfaction about the training and the application of skills learned to educational practice. The main results point out that teachers said they were available to receive more specific training, mainly practical, in order to use the DTS and produce educational videos. They were satisfied with the training received, but they liked to have more hours of training, which is not always compatible with their academic load. They thought it is good to share the video production with the students, and that these technologies are effective in improving learning.
