Business Areas and Processes Alignment in ICT Framework
ABSTRACT
The Management of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in an organizational context can enhance or limit the strategy towards business development. In this context, the alignment between the organization's management and governance and the ICT department is considered essential. Medium / large size organizations are faced with difficulties underlying greater complexity in the daily management of the operation of services and related processes. Towards the improvement, it was considered important to implement the universally accepted ICT management practices, ITIL and COBIT. Considering that these references indicate what should be implemented, but not how to do it, based on the problems detected, a complementary, integrative and multidisciplinary approach is presented in order to enhance ICT management in the alignment between the different areas of the department, consolidating the organization's strategy. The methodology used was centered on the study of the organization, on the literature review of the theme and international standards. The contributions of the approach seek to optimize the established management practices and the continuous improvement of ICT processes in the context of the organization. Use of reference frameworks will drive stakeholder satisfaction and cost optimization.
