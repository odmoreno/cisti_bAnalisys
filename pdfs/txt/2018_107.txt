Computer-vision-based surveillance of intelligent transportation systems
ABSTRACT
This project focuses on the development of a video analytics processor for detection and classification of vehicles on motorways. The motivation for this project comes from the need to have a plug-and-play solution to analyse traffic, as most of the existing solutions require training some sort of structure to recognise objects on the scene. Such a module can work as a data input for traffic management systems in addition to more traditional sensors such as the magnetic loop detectors. We also present a novel approach to the vehicle classification problem based on the use of a fuzzy set. To illustrate the proposed approach, the detection and classification algorithms implemented were tested with different cameras in different scenarios, showing promising results.
