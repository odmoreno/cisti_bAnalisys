Students Profiles and their Behavior in MOOC Platforms, MIRIADAX Platform
ABSTRACT
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) have revolutionized the relation between higher education institutions and society. Through web platforms, universities and other institutions offer content and courses where any student can enroll. With this new approach, much knowledge that previously was only accessible to official students paying, in general, expensive fees, is now accessible to any citizen for free. In addition, institutions of higher education usually grant a certificate to students who passed the course. However, this divulgative and massive open approach also creates some distortions. In particular, the management of MOOC courses is a task of extreme complexity, due to the mixture of a large number of very different student profiles, and the combination of nonaligned interests. As a consequence, the dropout rate in these courses is higher than 70% in most courses. In any case, before proposing any solution, it is necessary to analyze and study the current situation in a systematic and scientific way. Therefore, this article describes an experience carried out jointly by professors from the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM, Spain) and the University of Tras os Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), based on the creation and teaching of a MOOC course focused on domotics and Arduino technologies, accessible on the MiriadaX platform. This study focuses on the academic results obtained, and the different profiles of students that have been identified in the 2018 academic year.
