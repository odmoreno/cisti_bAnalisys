Evaluation of taxi services on airport terminal's curbside for picking up passengers
ABSTRACT
Intermodal interfaces are extremely important for the transportation system as a whole. Therefore, designing and dimensioning airport terminals' curbsides are major steps to improve passengers' experience. Indeed, evaluating such design is a critical task that must be performed to point out the best solution. This paper reports our modeling, implementing, and evaluating two curbside scenarios: one as currently applied to the Portela Airport, in Lisbon, and another alternative as proposed by a Transport Consultancy Agency. Our contribution results in the creation of a broader methodology to evaluate various scenarios, in addition to determining the best scenario between the ones presented and discussed in this paper. Some preliminary experiments are carried out, whose results are presented and discussed so as to compare their efficiency. Finally, we draw some conclusions and point out ways in which this work can be further extended.
