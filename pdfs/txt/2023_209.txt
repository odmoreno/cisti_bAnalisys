Continuous Inspection of Software Quality in an Automotive Project
ABSTRACT
Due to the amount of software that is produced every day in the automotive industry, improve software quality became a necessity, especially in areas where safety is a critical point, such as autonomous driving. Following on from this, continuous inspection of software is important, timely and central, to guarantee software quality and avoid the worst scenarios related to the automotive industry, particularly with autonomous driving. Even so, this proposal is motivated by the huge number of failures associated with low quality software. In this way, the main objective of this research is to achieve a solution for continuous inspection of software quality in the context of the company Bosch Car Multimedia.
