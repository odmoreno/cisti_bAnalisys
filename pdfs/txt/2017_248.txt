Visualization of data analysis graphs with RHadoop
ABSTRACT
The present work presents an analysis to terms related to Big Data, Hadoop and presents results by means of RHadoop the combination of two technologies as are R and Hadhoop, these technologies are complemented in an advantageous way, because it allows the analysis and visualization of large volumes Of data, in addition a case study of the tweet is generated that generates from a user account using Hadoop (Apache Hive) and the presentation of reports with RHadoop that support to the Managers of the organizations to a better decision-making. In order to do this, a detailed search has been made regarding Big Data, Hadoop Framework and the means of visualization and generation of a Data Volume with RHadoop, in which a synthesis of the different important terms was made, Arriving to determine different areas of application, in addition is presented a case study of a data volume with Hadoop applied to tweets generated from the social network Twitter. In this context it is concluded that with the help of the Hadoop Framework we can process a large volume of data, since its architecture has the Hadoop Distributed File System that provides a high performance of access to data of the application and Apache Hive that executes the processes In parallel with the integration of tools such as RHadoop allows the analysis of a large amount of information and submit reports that support the decision-making of organizations.
