Appreciation of virtual learning environments by Higher Education teachers
ABSTRACT
Virtual learning environments have become more and more important in all levels of education, especially in Higher Education. With this paper we intend to identify the appreciation that a sample of university teachers made regarding the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in their courses, the characteristics of digital resources associated with the Sakai environment and the availability of digital resources in that environment. Data were obtained using an online survey. The results obtained indicate that the most valued aspects of using ICT within the courses were the resources availability and access as well as time saving. The most valued characteristics of digital resources were their accessibility and easy use. With respect to resources availability, the most valued were the publishing of general information and of course-related digital resources.
