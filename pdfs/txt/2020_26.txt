Collaborative learning tools used in virtual higher education programs: a sistematic review of literature in Iberoamerica
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to review significant evidence on the use of virtual learning tools that foster collaborative learning in virtual Latin American higher education programs, recognizing in them the most recurrent tools, benefits and factors that enhance their use, as well as limitations of its application in the teaching process - virtual learning. The systematic review allowed a total of 43 related articles that meet the inclusion criteria of a total of 922 manuscripts extracted from seven scientific databases showing results of studies conducted during the period 2009-2019. The descriptors used were collaborative learning supported by computer (CSCL), collaborative work and collaborative tools, with other terms that are associated with the meta-analytical procedure defined for this study such as: higher education, Latin America, Spain and Portugal. The results show that the use of collaborative learning tools accompanied by a didactic method and an instructional design that complements the different forms of interaction, provide valuable contributions to education and knowledge building.
