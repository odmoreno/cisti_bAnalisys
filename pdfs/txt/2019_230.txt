Vegetation Modeling for Driving Environments
ABSTRACT
Conducting scientific experiments in driving simulators requires the modeling of reliable and complete road environments. These environments must provide extensive landscapes with the artifacts and natural element that can be usually found in the real world. This paper presents a method to efficiently produce models of natural vegetation. The produced models are then applied to populate existing terrain definitions, allowing the fast preparation of extensive environments with realistic landscapes. The human supervisor can interact in this generation process, in order to obtain custom landscapes definitions. After the landscape generation process, the road network definition can be then generated, producing a complete driving environment, in an integrated modeling process. The proposed method allows modeling a wide range of drive environments, with the realism and quality required to the realization of virtual training or experimental work in many terrain based activities, such driving simulators.
