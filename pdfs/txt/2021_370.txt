The relationship between taxation and foreign direct investment: A systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
The fundamental objective of this study is to characterise the empirical research that has been developed within the context of the relationship between foreign direct investment and taxation, covering a 15-year period (2005-2019). The research methodology adopted was the systematic literature review. In particular, the study at issue is based on the PRISMA recommendation. The results obtained reveal that the number of publications concerning the relationship between foreign direct investment and taxation has been increasing. With respect to the most investigated subject areas, it appears that the majority of researchers choose to study the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth, as well as to quantify the impact of granting tax incentives and of corporate income tax rates in attracting this type of investment. In relation to the profile of the researchers, it is possible to conclude that the most frequent type of authorship is the collective one, with many of the referred researchers being responsible for the publication of only one article. This type of study is becoming increasingly relevant among academics, as it makes it possible to conclude about the characteristics and trends of publications over time, as well as the state of the art of research.
