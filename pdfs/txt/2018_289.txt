A survey on wearable health monitoring systems
ABSTRACT
Wearable health monitoring systems are being used as a way of cost reduction, and extension of medical care outside medical facilities. But, despite considerable time and work of the research in the field, important challenges, such as power consumption or security issues, still are a major concern. In this paper we present a survey in the field, extended to systems not wearable, to give a broad perspective of the research in this area, and find some of the most relevant challenges that this technology presents nowadays.
