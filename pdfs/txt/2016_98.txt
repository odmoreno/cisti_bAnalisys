SaaS impact assessment in business contexts
ABSTRACT
The technological evolution allows us to have highly flexible solutions, easily accessible with lower investment values, which leads to many companies adopting SaaS (Software as a Service) to support their business processes. Nowadays, almost all of the IT strategies decision-makers in organizations are encouraged to consider the adoption of SaaS as an IT solution, because of the benefits of convenience associated with technology or market competition. Very often business strategies decision-makers only consider the attractive incentives of SaaS and they ignore the impacts associated with new technologies. A holistic view of the implications in the development, in the supply, in the use and in the operation of SaaS in different types of business organizations is necessary.
