Towards the development of future trend scenarios through dynamic analysis : A proposal of integration of Artificial Intelligence, Data Sciences and the field of Futures Studies to adapt to new environments
ABSTRACT
The paper discusses the role of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) with the field of Futures Studies. That is, combining the art of conjecture with several algorithms available in the literature. The combination between qualitative and quantitative methods offers a new dynamic adaptation route to face the rapidly changing environment, to make strategic design more flexible in the long term. The proposal uses the ISSM framework [36] as a notion of a strategic Early Warning System (SEWS) [31]. The purpose is help to develop the component named competitive intelligence (CI) architecture to create knowledge about the future, improving continuous learning, and promote the capacity to adaptation. Therefore, anticipation, learning and strategic adaptation, are key attributes for building strategic flexibility that responds to several challenges.
