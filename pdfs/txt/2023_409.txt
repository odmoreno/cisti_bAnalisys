Rethinking the curricula in accounting education: An interdisciplinary student-centered approach
ABSTRACT
Higher education institutions, as well as other organizations, must play an increasingly crucial role in the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 In this context, this work, through an exploratory study carried out in the Higher Institute of Accounting and Administration of the University of Aveiro aims to identify teaching methodologies that can be used across an Accounting course, so that students acquire not only the technical skills, but also the soft skills needed in a world in permanent and rapid evolution. The results suggest the need to introduce specific contents into the Accounting course curriculum, as well as the use of active, technological and interdisciplinary teaching methodologies. Following these results, an Interdisciplinary and Pedagogical Innovation Project was developed for the degree in Accounting.
