Blended learning supported on a learning management system an intervention for digital literacy for older adults
ABSTRACT
Online learning play a pivotal role for institutions and universities, because these can support active learning approaches to students. For this reason, it seems important to plan models and / or strategies to allow the older adult population to acquire and enhance digital competencies more easily. This article describes an innovative practice of Blended Learning Supported on a Learning Management System (LMS) whose aim is to enable older people developing digital skills through the using of multimedia teaching materials. The sample of older people was made of 53 Old Females (68 ± 7.61) and 28 Old Males (72.5 ± 7.27). 61 older adults participed in the face-to-face workshop on digital literacy and 20 participed in the blended workshop. Later, a Usability Test was summited to the adults who used the LMS. The results showed that the blended workshop is a very good idea as long as it is used as a support system, because if it were adopted in a totally asynchronous manner, they would have difficulties using it due to lack of assistance.
