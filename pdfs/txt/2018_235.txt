Measurement of air pollution with low-cost technology
ABSTRACT
The manufacturing processes, the transportation industry and the use of fossil fuels intensified with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-eighteenth century, since then the global contamination began. It is in the industrial age when the levels of air, water and soil pollution reach high levels, causing health problems for the population. In this sense, air pollution and the lack of monitoring points of the quality of this, is one of the main environmental and technological challenges of cities in the world. This paper presents the design and development of an air pollution assessment system in the city of David, Republic of Panam√° using Arduino technology. The low cost system allows sending the data wirelessly for the respective analysis.
