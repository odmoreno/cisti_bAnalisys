Geographic information system with public participat on IoS system
ABSTRACT
With participation from the general public, it is possible to measure the quality of public services rendered to the population. The current proposal aims to collect popular opinion through an app, simplifying and facilitating the use of the app for users, and increasing the speed at which government managers receive this information. This application, developed for Apple's iOS system, aims to integrate popular opinion to its location, thus providing voluntary geographic information.
