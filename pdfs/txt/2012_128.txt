CASE tool for object-relational database designs
ABSTRACT
In 1999, the SQL standard version presented new features to manipulate objects in relational database which has since been called Object-Relational Database (ORDB). Nowadays, many Object-Relational Database Management Systems (ORDBMS) offer resources to manipulate object in database. However, for these resources to become really utilized in corporate environment, it is necessary, among other things, to have CASE tools to aid in object-relational database design. An extension made in ArgoUML tool that permits developers to build graphics schemas to ORDBs is presented. These schemas can be generated using an ORDB profile presented here in. This profile is an extension of the UML class diagram and contains elements to represent the new resources to manipulate object in databases. The tool maps the graphic schema to SQL:2003 code and SQL code to Oracle dialect.
