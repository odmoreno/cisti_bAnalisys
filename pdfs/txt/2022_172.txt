What features a mobile app focused on cultural tourism and interculturality should have?
ABSTRACT
The tourism sector is one of the sectors that most benefits from technological innovation. There are many online platforms and mobile applications available that provide a better experience to everyone. Cultural tourism, being a specific type of tourism focused on tangible and intangible culture, also benefits from this factor. This paper aims to investigate the needs and expectations of real users through interviews with experts in the field, a systematic review of the literature and the state of the art of mobile applications already on the market. This paper presents part of the results of the investigation carried out within the scope of a project whose objective was the creation of a high-fidelity prototype of a mobile application for cultural tourism and interculturality.
