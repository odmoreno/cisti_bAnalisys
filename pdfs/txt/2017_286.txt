Theoric model for the specification and management of the business process, based on the use of big data and Internet of Things (IoT)
ABSTRACT
The Business Processes (PN) and the study of the aspects that allow to formally specify their properties and efficiently manage them, have now become a subject of extensive research. Due to the multiplicity of elements involved in the treatment of PNs and that their definition has evolved over time, this article makes a historical review of the concepts related to the formal specification of PN properties, management and control of them, with special emphasis on the PN associated with Internet of Things or IoT (Digital Interconnection of everyday objects with Internet), which also require that its persistence be carried out under Big Data, due to the large amount and variability of the data and at the speeds required to process them. Likewise, some conceptual models based on the most recent definitions on this topic are proposed. Additionally, the definition of verifiable properties of PNs is introduced. This article is part of a research in progress that aims to provide a theoretical framework that gathers the relationship of the most important aspects of the process of specification and management of PNs, on IoT based on Big Data.
