Survey on Augmented Reality Technologies for Naval Training
ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that extends the perception of human reality by allowing, for instance, to insert virtual objects in real environments. With Augmented Reality, learning can be more effective through annotations and interactivity when seeing and manipulating the content. The purpose of this article was to survey the AR technology amenable to support the development of solutions for training in the maritime context. For this purpose, different technologies of the existing devices were analysed in order to elicit the characteristics of devices in order the adapt their usage to a specific context of training solutions. The characteristics of the different markers used to trigger AR applications were also analysed.
