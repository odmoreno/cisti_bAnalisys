System of monitoring and automation of temperature of a Turkish bath
ABSTRACT
The present work seeks to develop an autonomous system for the release of steam from a boiler, with the aim of automating and monitoring the operation of a Turkish bath located in a hostel in the town, the system allows to eliminate the intervention of people. That is why the following work addresses the design, simulation and implementation of a temperature control and monitoring system within a Turkish bath, seeking the comfort of users. The system consists of a sensor module which provides an input signal of RTD PT100 temperature sensor. Subsequently, the acquisition card processes the data to then send a signal when the temperature inside the Turkish bath reaches the maximum threshold established, consequently the valve releases the steam to reduce the temperature to the minimum threshold, once this lower threshold has been reached the valve closes the steam release. Finally, the system was developed and implemented, being evaluated in the hostel “Mi compadre” fulfilling the proposed objectives, to give security and comfort to the users.
