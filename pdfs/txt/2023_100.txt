Application of Multicriteria Decision Analysis in Decision Making : A study of the demands of Information Technology in the Federal Government
ABSTRACT
In an increasingly dynamic environment, the speed of decision-making has become a differential, especially in a scenario that has many obstacles, such as the government. Interests from different spheres (municipal, state and federal) and different actors (political parties, benches, mobilization of popular groups), must be consolidated in the most assertive decision for society. Thus, methods that guarantee the decrease of subjectivity and increase the consolidation of different points of view are necessary. Thus, the objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) via the Promethee II method to prioritize criteria for information technology demands within the Federal Public Ministry. This is an exploratory research with a qualitative-quantitative approach using multicriteria analysis. As a result of the study, the criteria Support, Strategic and Interested Parties were established, with the respective approximate weights of 65%, 28% and 7%. Eight alternatives were defined, where the most prominent was “Technical knowledge of the ICT team“ with an approximate weight of 24.5%. The combination of criteria and alternatives applied during the research resulted, among the 12 selected, in the demand for Security as the highest priority and the demand for BI as the lowest priority, proving alignment with the institution’s strategic objectives.
