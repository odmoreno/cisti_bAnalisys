Model for Performance Evaluation of Web Service in Cloud on Image Consumption on Mobile Devices
ABSTRACT
This work has two objectives to be achieved. The first goal is to evaluate the performance of a Webservice in the cloud environment by analyzing the sending of images to mobile devices focused on social networking applications. From this evaluation, the second objective proposes strategies to mitigate the effects of delays in the display of these images, in order to optimize the quality of the service. The methodological process consisted in the planning and execution of experiments to evaluate the performance of different scenarios with different amounts of images, resolutions and database for storage. The Eucalyptus platform was defined as the Cloud environment, and a Webservice sending persistent images in NoSQL Databases to a mobile device. The results highlight that the parameter that influences the performance of the image consumption in mobile devices through the WebService is the processing of the images in the mobile device itself. The results obtained confirm that to optimize the image consumption performance in mobile devices, it is necessary to build efficient and adherent algorithms for image processing on the device screen.
