Acceasy - A front-end framework prototype for developing responsive web applications with accessibility for visually impaired people
ABSTRACT
This article presents a study for the creation of a framework for the front-end development of web applications with accessibility for the visually impaired and responsiveness. As a result, Acceasy (created tool), its operation, some examples and the project's contributions to web application developers and end users are presented. As a final result, the framework created proved to be able to generate responsive web pages, with semantic codes and use of accessibility markings, automatically and transparently for web developers, thus facilitating their work. Pages created with the tool also show improvements in accessibility for screen readers. Some validations still need to be made and at the end, future work is listed.
