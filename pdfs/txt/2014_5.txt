SBIAES — Business intelligence system for analysis of access to higher education: The case of the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra
ABSTRACT
In recent years there has been a significant reduction in the number of students who are applying to higher education, which intensifies the competition among institutions of higher education, universities and polytechnics, for attracting students. A thorough knowledge of the candidates and their preferences in terms of courses and major competitors' institutions is essential to the strategic planning of higher education institutions both in terms of promotion and in the level of training offered. In this regard, the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra decided to develop a tool to analyze data from the National Competition for Access to Higher Education, the SBIAES — Business Intelligence System for analysis of Access to Higher Education, consists of a Data Warehouse and a client application in Microsoft Excel, using the PowerPivot and Power View technologies. This system allows to the decision makers of the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra to analyze quickly and intuitively the leading indicators, such as rational and non-rational preferences.
