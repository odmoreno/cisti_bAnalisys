FPGA-based controller for automata using alpha and beta neural impulses
ABSTRACT
This article presents the development of a communication system which intends to control devices through brain waves. These waves receiver gathers reliable readings through a sensor which is placed on the area called by neuroscientists FP1, as well as small tweezers on the ear lobe which works as neutral electric reference needed to increase the precision of receiving signals. It also has a signal processor FPGA-based which wirelessly receives data from the cerebral cortex using radiofrequency signals, and transmits command infrared signals to the automat. This process allows the user to apply control with no need for physical effort. The methodology of this design focuses on users with some type of limb movement deficiencies or difficulties to use them. Therefore, this process presents a system which enables users to obtain an immediate measure of their attention and meditation. This system helps users, with or without physical limitations, perform activities without using their limbs, either because they are using them for something else or environment limitations.
