QoLIS — Health business analitics platform based on quality of life related with health
ABSTRACT
The ability to effectively measure the quality of health-related life (HRQoL) is a key aspect to describe the impacts of the disease, treatment, or other injuries, beyond normal and expected aging of the patient. During the last two decades, the assessment of the patient's health status has undergone a dramatic change of paradigm, evolving from a predominant reliance on biochemical and physical measurements to an emphasis on health outcomes based on personal appreciation of the patient's illness. There are several measuring instruments to evaluate Quality of Life (QoL) in general and HRQoL in particular but the real-time analysis of data produced by these instruments is only possible with technology associated with decision support systems (DSS). The development of these types of information systems are a few problems that must be resolved. The QoLIS (Quality of Life Information System) is an “Health Business Analitics” (HBA) based in a web platform that uses information on HRQoL, in addition to clinical data, to provide information to support the clinician in decision making and can interact with any data source.
