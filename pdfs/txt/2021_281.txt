The Use of Gamification in Companies: A Study in the Region of Leiria in Portugal
ABSTRACT
Gamification has attracted the attention of researchers from various areas. Considering the evolution of gamification over the years, the need to understand its use in companies becomes a growing necessity. The goal of this research is to survey the use of gamification in the Leiria Region. Our study occurs from the fact that there is no study about the use of gamification in companies in Portugal, even if this theme presents a growing interest. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected from small, medium, and large companies in the Leiria Region. The results of the study point to the fact that gamification is not being used in the region and that companies do not know the concept. Thus, arose the need to reverse this scenario and to promote the implementation of gamification solutions in companies. For this, some proposals for this specific region are presented.
