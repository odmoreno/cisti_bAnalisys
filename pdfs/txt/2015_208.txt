Methodology for business process modeling: A study case within the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management
ABSTRACT
Business process modeling is currently an important step in supporting the development of computational systems, as it occurs prior to the establishment of what is required for implementing the system. The business process mapping and its description are designed to further develop and structure the activities needed for the successful execution of this task. This article presents a modeling methodology for process mapping that can be applied to the development of large computational systems. The methodology was applied in a case study of business process mapping, using BPMN, for the development of the human resource management system of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management - MPOG in Brazil.
