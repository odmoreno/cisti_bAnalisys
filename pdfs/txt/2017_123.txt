The health map: A mobile application proposal for social participation
ABSTRACT
The present proposal is based on the use of mobile applications to stimulate social participation to strengthen the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) of Brazil and the inclusion of the citizen as protagonist to monitor public health policies. The general objective is to present a technological platform for mobile devices that enables citizens to participate and record information about health facilities, particularly those in the public network. The research methodology included the following steps: bibliographic research; definition of the application scope; application development; testing and publication. The main result was the publication in the App Store, for free download, of the iOS application called Mapa da Saúde.
