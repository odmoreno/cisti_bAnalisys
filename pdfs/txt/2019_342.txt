The Quality Systems' Certification in the Framework of ISO and A3ES and the Importance of the Involvement of Audit
ABSTRACT
This article' purpose is to make a comparative analysis between the Quality Management System (NP EN ISO 9001: 2015) and the Internal Quality Assurance System within the scope of A3ES accreditation, seeking to understand the coincident points between both, as well as presenting the benefits of quality certification in A3ES assessments. It was possible to verify that there are many complementary aspects between the requirements of NP EN ISO 9001: 2015 and the scope areas of the Internal Quality Assurance System of the A3ES, concluding that the quality certification presents benefits to higher education institutions, leaving best prepared for A3ES assessments. However, it has been found that the involvement of internal auditing is not only mandatory in both systems, but its involvement has a determining role for resource optimization and continuous improvement.
