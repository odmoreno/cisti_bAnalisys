Future funding of public TV and radio in Europe
ABSTRACT
The analysis of latest figures and funding systems of public TV and Radio in Europe reflects stagnation, instability, inability to predict, lack of independence and uncertainty regarding the future of current funding and income generating systems. This article analyses the annual accounts of European Public TV and Radio companies from 2010 to 2015 and comments on their funding and corporate governance models and systems. The empirical analysis is also contrasted with the academic views and theories of the Global PSM Experts Network and the European Broadcasting Union.
