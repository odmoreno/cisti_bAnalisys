Evolution of the Merger Market and Acquisitions in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market in Ecuador. The results based on public information of 28 operations between the period 2012 to 2020 showed growth with a total investment of US$2.4 million. The Fast-moving consumer goods industry accounted for 50% of the deals with an investment of US$919 million. Regarding the level of integration, 88% corresponded to acquisitions of companies mainly in the food, oil, and mining sectors. Consolidation of holding companies is the principal economic motivation for mergers and acquisitions. Finally, the study for the Ecuadorian context proposes evidence that describes the evolution of the sector and guides decision-making for investors in the market.
