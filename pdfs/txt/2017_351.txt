Hypertransparency and new technologies: Analysis of public information in TVE and RPT
ABSTRACT
One of the distinctive features of the current citizenry is its growing demand for an increasing ethical commitment and transparency from its political representatives and the public or private institutions related to them. This growing demand should also apply to public television broadcasters, since they are usually funded by state resources. Moreover, they play an important role in the citizens' full enjoyment of their right to information, thereby favoring a formed public opinion and, in consequence, having an impact on the quality of democracy in their countries. Therefore, this paper proposes 58 indicators aimed at generally analyzing and assessing the transparency of television broadcasters and being applied to state-owned public broadcasters in the Iberian Peninsula: Spain and Portugal.
