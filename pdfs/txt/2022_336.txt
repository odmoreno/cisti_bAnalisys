ABSTRACT
This research focuses its aim on elucidating the usefulness of the urban cadastre as a tool for estimating important factors in the assessment of risk. Thus, the case study of the city of Loja is taken, analyzing the cadastral base of the same for the estimation of direct economic losses due to damage to vulnerable buildings in the city. The results show that the parish with the greatest probable impact on buildings is Punzara.
