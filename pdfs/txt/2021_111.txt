The Effects of the Project Managerâ€™s Emotional Intelligence on Project Success
ABSTRACT
In project management, the manager's soft skills have assumed greater importance. These skills have proven to be important in the success of the projects. Thus, we estimated a model using SmartPLS in which we tested the effects of emotional intelligence on the success of projects and the cohesion of project teams. Our research obtained responses from project managers who showed that their emotional intelligence translates into the greatest success of the projects they manage. The results show that the ability to understand and manage emotions among project members increases their ability to reinforce project teams' focus on important tasks and challenges that increase team success and cohesion.
