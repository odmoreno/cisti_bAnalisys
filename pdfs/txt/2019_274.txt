IT-Business Strategic Alignment in Social Era
ABSTRACT
The problem discussed in this paper is the paradox associated with the hundreds of contributions of the scientific community over three decades, mainly leveraged by the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) and its perspectives, but whose benefits arising from its applicability to the real world are scarce. The context of public sector organizations, which does not fit into any of the four perspectives presented by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993), led to the intertwining of the theme with the Social Era, predominantly people-driven or relationship-driven. The hypothesis formulation involves interconnecting convergent concepts, such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and e-participation, to potentiate the change of perspective, allowing to achieve the desired strategic alignment (IT-Business).
