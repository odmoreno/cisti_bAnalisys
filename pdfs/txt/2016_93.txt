Change management in technology projects: Using a comprehensive model of change management
ABSTRACT
Technology projects, including the introduction of new systems such as CRMs and ERPs, have an impact on peoples emotions, perceptions and performance, as well as on organizational and company culture. They also tend to raise a series of management issues that are seldom addressed, causing many technology projects to fail. Technology managers must learn how to manage those changes associated with the introduction of new systems and technical innovations. Change management, a relatively new discipline, offers new perspectives to address the costs and risks associated with change processes. It analyzes critical management issues such as the role of leadership, coordination, process design, and implementation strategies. Special emphasis is given to soft skills such as managing emotions, communicating project goals and achievements, and handling the critical issue of power structures and their evolution during change processes.
