Platform for university teaching applying Computational Thinking at the Armed Forces University ESPE
ABSTRACT
The inclusion of computational thinking in third-level professional training is an alternative that revolutionize traditional teaching through new paradigms, ICT tools and new platforms such as the one proposed in this paper that describes the development and implementation of a prototype that allows incorporating computational thinking into educational constructivist models, exploiting the capacities and abilities of a global and interconnected society. The prototype was submitted to an evaluation by 120 students of Information Technology (IT) faculty of the Armed Forces University ESPE located in Sangolqua, Ecuador, in the fields: performance and acceptance of the user, obtaining acceptable results about its applicability, usability and adaptation to the training model by competencies of the institution. The research methodology Desing Science Research (DSR), SCRUM as a design methodology and AppGini as a development tool were applied.
