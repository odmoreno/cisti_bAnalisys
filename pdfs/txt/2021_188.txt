Business Analytics and Car Insurance Mediation: a data driven model proposal
ABSTRACT
The growth of data generated by companies, are increasingly and better used, with the use of tools and processes of Business Intelligence and Business Analytics. This allows companies to make more reality-oriented and data-based models. We suggest a "pay-as-you-drive" model, which allows car insurance companies to submit proposals based on a larger number of variables and adjusted to each insured person, a model built with data collection by insurance companies, in order to adjust the insurance premium. Thus, each mediator assigns a greater or lesser weight to the variables that are considered most relevant for each policyholder. The contribution of this work corresponds to a new model that balances the insurance premium with the probability of unwanted occurrences.
