Usability study of SClinico
ABSTRACT
The use of electronic health records to support health activities is currently quite widespread, due to the increasing complexity of health care and the need to optimize human and material resources. The requirement of health care professionals to access clinical information expeditiously is a key factor in the quality of health care services. Therefore, the assessment of the usability of the health of applications is crucial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of SClínico through a questionnaire especially developed, and it took place in an hospital environment. The SClínico is an electronic health record application used on a large scale in public Portuguese healthcare institutions. The results show that SClínico has some usability issues that need to be improved. Among these we highlight the need to take a holistic view of the patient's health record and simultaneously quick access to relevant details for different clinical situations.
