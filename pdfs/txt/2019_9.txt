Air Quality Monitoring System Within Campus by Using Wireless Sensor Networks
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a solution to monitor CO2emissions produced by vehicles within a university campus. The system is implemented based on distributed sensor nodes by using ZigBee technology. Several sensors were placed around the main streets on campus in order to monitor CO2concentrations. Data suggested that speed bumps generate increased levels of CO2, which are emitted by vehicles. We determine that the CO2levels in our campus are 410 parts per million, which is within tolerable limits. The wireless system developed has been used as a tool to take actions in order to reduce the environmental pollution around our university campus, and to improve traffic by removing the speed bumps or to restrict the circulation of vehicles at peak hours when the system indicates that pollution levels are high.
