A comparison of machine learning algorithms applied to hand gesture recognition
ABSTRACT
Hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction is an area of active research in computer vision and machine learning. The primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create a system, which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. This paper presents a comparative study of four classification algorithms for static hand gesture classification using two different hand features data sets. The approach used consists in identifying hand pixels in each frame, extract features and use those features to recognize a specific hand pose. The results obtained proved that the ANN had a very good performance and that the feature selection and data preparation is an important phase in the all process, when using low-resolution images like the ones obtained with the camera in the current work.
