Databases internationalization model
ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a new internationalization model for databases. This model is intended to enable the internationalization (i18n) in a database, thus facilitating the work of both the database developer as well as the translator which performs its localization (l10n). The use of this model should reduce the developer's effort and allow the translator not to worry about application implementation details. On the other hand, with this model it will be possible to do l10n maintenance keeping the database online. We have implemented an internal module for the database engine that allows the detachment of all the elements dependent on the country language and culture being used. This detachment makes the elements' source independent enough so that its components can be edited by a translator without any databases knowledge and refilled at run time, i.e. with the database in full operation. This also allows new sources to be added for different cultures and languages. The proposed model may be useful for several types of applications, an interesting example would be in the development of business applications where much of its rules and validations that defines the company's business is applied at the database level. With this solution for database internationalization it is not necessary to create specific tables, relations and any other needed database objects, which requires more expensive query and maintenance methods.
