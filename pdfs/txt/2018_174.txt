Smartphone-based monitoring system of a coffee roaster machine, applied to small industry
ABSTRACT
Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world and is the second most traded product after oil. For medium-sized producers there is an urgent need for practical and innovative ideas to produce low-cost ground coffee and increase the overall sustainability of coffee agribusiness. Within the coffee production chain is the roasting phase, which is the most important stage in which the coffee bean undergoes physicochemical changes that provide its sensory characteristics such as aroma and flavor, however there are companies and producers in general that do it empirically. Based on the foregoing, the objective addressed in the present project is to propose an architecture for monitoring the roasting temperature, low cost, portable and compatible with coffee roasters used in our geography. As a result of the project, an electronic prototype and a mobile application were developed and evaluated in the machines produced by the company Setcomet.
