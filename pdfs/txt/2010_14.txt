Courseware sere: Technical and didactic evaluation made by students
ABSTRACT
Software packages for educational purposes are increasingly important for classroom use, because they are a valuable way to motivate learning. However, the resources available on the market, with the designation of educational software, often have dubious quality. This led the authors to reflect on the process of evaluating the quality of a given educational software and develop tools that allow to measure its quality. This paper presents the results of the technical (software) and educational (guidelines for the didactic exploration) evaluation of Courseware Sere - The Human Being and Natural Resources - made by students of 2nd cycle of basic education (10 to 12 year old). The results indicate that the resource is easy to use, even for students who do not regularly use computers. It can also be concluded that the evaluation of educational resources, made by end-users, allows to correct issues related to usability (navigation and interaction), and to ensure the adequacy of resource to the target levels of education.
