Proposal of a model to classify software residency environments
ABSTRACT
In Brazil the idea of residence in software (transposition from medical residency to the software production) has proliferated in recent years. Have all these environments a defined and institutionalized process, project quality management policies and them can be characterized as residence? This paper proposes a classifying environments model for residence in software, with the goal is answering this question. To delineate the model the authors used the theory that permeates the idea of residence in software and assumptions of the process evaluation methods (ISO / IEC 15504 [1], SCAMPI [2] and MA-MPS-BR [3] â€” Evaluation Model of Brazilian Improvement Model Software Process). The model validation is characterized by a multiple case study, eight environments from north to south of Brazil were analyzed.
