Integration-as-a-service for bioinformatics
ABSTRACT
Data integration is currently an essential service for bioinformatics researchers and developers. The ability to import, transform and export data from multiple resources is also a common feature for miscellaneous platforms, ranging from complex application suites to simple standalone command-line tools. Despite the quality behind available solutions, data and services' evolution keeps pushing integration demands forward, to cope, for instance, with dynamic data sources and cloud-based technologies. In this work we introduce a cloud-based framework to streamline the integration of services and data in bioinformatics. Our goal is to facilitate the creation of next-generation bioinformatics applications that rely heavily on automated, real-time, integration and interoperability tasks.
