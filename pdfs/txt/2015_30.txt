Model for monitoring and control of software production in distributed projects
ABSTRACT
An increasing number of companies are distributing their software production processes around the world, for productivity gains, cost savings and quality improvements. Software engineers have recognized the great influence of this form of work and are looking for models to facilitate projects with distributed teams. In addition to the engineers also project managers have faced challenges at different levels in the development of distributed software (DDS). This work aims to propose a model to monitor and control projects in DDS, using as a basis the Toyotism and version control systems to assist the project manager. The method used to validate the proposed model was experimental, that simulated a real DDS environment, mobilizing 40 developers. For an initial application, the model showed positive results, as the generated artifacts as well as the interplay of the teams.
