Telemedicine Acceptance in Brazil : Explaining behavioral intention to move towards internet-based medical consultations
ABSTRACT
Explaining behaviors around telemedicine acceptance in developing countries is an important developing area of study. This study aims to explore the effect of plasticity on telemedicine acceptance in Brazil. This paper focuses on Brazilian patients and their acceptance of telemedicine through the Theory of Planned Behavior and the concept of Plasticity as a superordinate factor of the patients' personality traits. An online survey of Brazilian patients was carried out, and PLS analysis was then utilized on the results. Results indicate that the proposed model explains 62.1% of the behavioral intention of the use of telemedicine by the patients. Furthermore, the findings indicate that attitude has the strongest direct effect on behavioral intention, with plasticity playing a considerable role in the strength of the effect.
