Blockchain in Collaborative Economy business models
ABSTRACT
In the last decade, we have witnessed the emergence of a new socioeconomic paradigm related to Internet-based virtual communities that promote practices of sharing the use or consumption of products and services: the collaborative economy. Despite growing research on the most diverse areas of the collaborative economy, research on the integration of blockchain systems into collaborative economy organizations is still rather limited. By the present investigation, purely explanatory and based on a comparative and interpretive case study, we intend to verify the susceptibility of the blockchain systems to foster the emergence of new business models. Due to the small number of organizations in the collaborative economy currently operating with blockchain-based business models, it will be important in future investigations to identify and study the influence of these systems on the business models of other organizations, in particular whether their adoption represents a source of competitive advantage.
