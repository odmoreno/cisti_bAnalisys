Modified Audit Report Model - Effect of 2016 Changes
ABSTRACT
In order to restore user confidence and minimize differences in audit expectations gap, changes to the audit report model were introduced in 2016. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the determination of the effectiveness of these changes, analyzing their effect on the auditor's opinion. From the content analysis of audit report, between the years 2013 and 2018, of a sample of 197 Portuguese corporations, it is concluded that the changes to the audit report model do not have a statistical significant effect on the number of qualifications and emphases issued per report, as well as on the number of different types of qualified opinions (limitation or disagreement), however, the same is not true with regard to the indication of continuity uncertainties, as these present a statistically significant reduction.
