Drone automaton for identification of clandestine airstrips
ABSTRACT
The use of illegal flights as a means of distribution of illicit substances has become a latent problem in the fight against drug trafficking within the Ecuadorian territory, due to the country's limited radar detection resources, especially in low-altitude flights (less than 500 feet). The so-called `drug planes' take off and land on Ecuadorian territory using improvised airstrips, which are not registered by the competent aeronautical authorities. Within these activities have been possible to identify the transfer of illegal substances, economic values for their acquisition or sale and even transfers of personalities involved in international drug trafficking. The specific geography of the region, especially in the Ecuadorian coast and east, is propitious for the adaptation of clandestine airstrips, which, due to their location, vegetation and limitations of access by land, limit the control and identification by the competent authorities. The present solution proposes to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to perform captures of images in real time in order to identify improvised or clandestine airstrips by means of the use of a software of interpretation of digital images.
