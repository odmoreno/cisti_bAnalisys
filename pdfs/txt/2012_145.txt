A generic executable framework for model-driven engineering
ABSTRACT
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has become in the last years one of the most promising technologies for software productivity improvement. Much technology has been developed around MDE including editors, model transformation engines, constraint definition languages, etc. However, the impact of MDE in software companies is still not deep enough, often because existing tools and methods fail to adapt to their individual needs. In this paper, a Generic Executable Model-Driven Engineering (GEMDE) framework is presented. GEMDE enables the full customization of the engineering process to fit any MDE methodology. The paper also presents an example customization of the tool adapting a UML-MARTE methodology to develop and analyze LEGO Mindstorm applications.
