Vintage and upcycling as branding strategies in sustainable fashion
ABSTRACT
This study analyzes consumer perceptions about the use of sustainable fashion, specifically, through vintage and upcycling, as part of the branding strategy of an independent brand located within Gamarra, a commercial emporium in Peru. A qualitative methodology was carried out to analyze their perceptions regarding the chosen case of study, the Infinity Beyond brand that markets the aforementioned sustainable fashion techniques. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with female clients of the brand and also followers of the official account on Instagram. Within the branding strategy, the sustainable fashion characteristic helps to differentiate it from its competitors and position the brand, because it relates its products to attributes of sustainability and authenticity, although the public does not necessarily know the meaning of sustainable fashion.
