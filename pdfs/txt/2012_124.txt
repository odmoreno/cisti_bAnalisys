Development of an interactive book with Augmented Reality for teaching and learning geometric shapes
ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on the GeoAR, an interactive book which incorporates Augmented Reality resources, developed to support teaching and learning of Geometry topics covering the main geometric shapes. The GeoAR development followed a process based on prototyping, proposed to support the creation of Augmented Reality applications. The paper points out concepts and related work, describes the development of the GeoAR, relates prototypes evaluations, and discusses the use of the GeoAR by children in a real situation.
