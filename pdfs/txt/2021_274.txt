Analysis of the Battery Energy Estimation Model in SUMO Compared with Actual Analysis of Battery Energy Consumption
ABSTRACT
Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a key alternative transportation for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions in the traffic sector. To promote the use of these vehicles a reliable, real-world close evaluation in terms of energy consumption and range is crucial. One of the most efficient and frequently adopted microscopic traffic simulation tools, simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), implements an energy estimation model that relies on vehicle and road characteristics. We conduct a comparative analysis of SUMOâ€™s estimated energy consumption and state of charge (SOC) of a simulated battery electric vehicle (BEV) and the energy consumption of an actual 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid LE AWD. Results showed that the energy consumption model in SUMO delivers different results than the ones obtained from the real world driving experiments. These findings are discussed in this paper.
