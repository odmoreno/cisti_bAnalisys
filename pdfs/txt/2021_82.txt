Maturity model of adoption of Information Technologies for universities: An approach from the Smart University perspective
ABSTRACT
An evolutionary approach for a traditional university to progress through levels towards a smart university can be seen in a maturity model. Although maturity models are numerous and widely applicable, there is little documentation on how to develop them. So far, academics often fall short of providing detailed guidelines and useful tools to support the practical adoption of models developed in universities. Technology management in universities has an impact on the quality of their academic and administrative processes. Smart Technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence continue to emerge with great prominence.
