Implementation of a digital transition process for the documentation of an alumni association
ABSTRACT
Often consisting of stacks or boxes of disordered documents, stored in cabinets full of boxes and papers, files tend to be evaluated only as an administrative requirement. With the recognition of the importance of documentary memory, the opportunity arises for a new approach to this type of resource. Lean originated in the manufacturing industry, aiming to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. Ever since, lean tools have been increasingly used in several fields, namely in the office environment, giving rise to the so-called lean office. Their principles can be applied to any type of office, from administrative and support functions to product development and customer service. On the other hand, digitalization can be a key enabler of lean office principles since it can help to automate and streamline processes, reduce errors and waste, and improve the flow of information. For instance, in associations with several members, digitalization can provide improved member engagement, enhanced event management, increased efficiency, and also a greater reach with members. Herein, the Former Students Association of the Industrial and Commercial School of Braga membersâ€™ information was gathered and organized into a digital file. The increase in the number of members over the last few years led to the need of digitizing their data, in order to improve the alumni association management.
