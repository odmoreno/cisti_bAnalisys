Comparing Process Mining Tools and Algorithms
ABSTRACT
As a result of the data explosion, most companies typically address the need to deal with massive volumes of data about their processes in their information systems. Some of this data, commonly known as event logs, contain valuable information about the activities that happen during the execution of a process in a company. Process mining attempts to extract valuable insights from these event logs. The main goal of this work is to understand the available technologies that may be used to develop process mining algorithms and to compare the results obtained. The generated process models should describe the complete workflow of decision and execution of each process so that their performance can be later evaluated according to a set of metrics.
