The identification of focal groups with social interest based on dynamic clusters
ABSTRACT
The study of mechanisms to faciliate the economic development of social groups is of vital importance to social scientists. One of the major contributions to development is the creation of economic clusters that are used together to achieve specific objectives. This consists of identifying business groups, companies, or muncipalities that are spacely disseminated. In this research, we propose a methodolgy, focuses on the results of thematic space analysis to obtain dynamic clusters that have a direct relationship with social associations. The results shows that there is a direct relationship between business potential and centroid groups, which are not excusively tied to distances between places. Although this work is only in its development stages, one of the primary conclusions is that it is possile to take advantage of the centroid space for group collaboration, which will help us to carry out future researchs in this field, and which will be addressed in other lab work.
