Intelligent Decision Support System in Inheritance Processes : a Research in the General Attorney Office of the State of Pernambuco
ABSTRACT
The Brazilian public legal sector is typically marked by the disproportionate ratio between the number of cases and the available number of specialized employees. However, many of these processes have minor importance for the State, which promotes overload for highly specialized and expensive employees with non-important activities that could be performed automatically or redistributed to lower level professionals. The present work proposes a decision support approach for analyzing inheritance processes in a state attorney's office. The objective is to develop a system for collecting, classifying, analyzing and ranking processes using text mining and machine learning in order to automate the document analysis procedure in a semantic manner. The put forward approach offers a novel way for objectively distribute processes according to their monetary importance and the hierarchical level of the involved professionals. The approach also proposes a tunable semantic analysis, which takes into account the user experience for the automatic document ranking, which can be easily adapted for other analytical activities in attorney's offices.
