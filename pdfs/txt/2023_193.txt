Heart Rate Variability Analysis to track stress level while learning Mathematics
ABSTRACT
Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been generally studied in research that associates the functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) with human health and wellbeing. In this article, however, we try to investigate the variation in the stress level through HRV during mathematics learning activities. The sample consisted of thirty-seven students from the final years of elementary school in the municipal public network, aged between 11 and 15 years and mostly female. The research, of applied nature, technological modality and qualitative and quantitative approach, collected the HRV variables in three different stages: during rest and in two moments of Cognitive Challenge. For this purpose, the Inner Balanceâ„¢ sensor was used and the data obtained were decoded by the Kubios HRV. The indices obtained by linear methods of time domain - Mean RR and RMSSD, and frequency domain LF/HF, in addition to the Stress Index (SI) were selected. For statistical analyses, standardization of scores was applied and JASP was used. The results indicated that during Cognitive Challenge 1, the highest levels of HRV and mental stress were perceived, which may be indicative of greater cognitive engagement. Considering the relevance of the findings, further research with a similar focus is suggested in order to validate the use of HRV for the analysis of mental stress and, furthermore, emphasizing that the results can be indicators for the construction of auxiliary artifacts in the effectiveness of the teaching process and math learning.
