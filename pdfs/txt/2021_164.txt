Applying Augmented Reality using mobile devices to safeguard the Náhuat language
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a proposal to contribute to the safeguarding of endangered langues, such as the Náhuat language. We have designed and implemented Android mobile applications and a Náhuat augmented reality textbook which has marker images. Through the respective augmented reality mobile application, students can view 2D animations with audio of the Náhuat dialogues in a cartoon format. Two Nahuat-Spanish dictionary android mobile applications have also been developed, both to support the Náhuat textbook. All those resources will be used in public and private institutions of primery education, in rural areas and in the capital city of El Salvador, where the Náhuat language is taught.
