GPON as a contribution to the construction of Smart Cities
ABSTRACT
The transformation process of a smart city requires a technological and connectivity platform that allows the development of a more efficient, inflexible and less expensive city. Gpon technology is an important ally to promote the sustainability of smart cities is a fiber optic access technology with multipoint architecture, which offers a scalable frame structure of 622 Mbps up to 2.5 Gbps. The aim of smart cities is to improve the quality of life of citizens and contribute to financial, social and political progress, the creation of new and more advanced services and the sustainability of the city. The achievement of this objective is feasible through the implementation of networks that support a high traffic of information, an architecture and platforms that can incorporate together the various components of the city and make them interact effectively. In this article the GPON Technology is presented as a contribution to the basic objective of smart cities Interconnectivity and access to information.
