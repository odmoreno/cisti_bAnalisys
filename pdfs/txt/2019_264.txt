Improving creative self-efficacy in information systems students An intervention founded on design science research
ABSTRACT
This study examined the effect of creativity training on a model that explains creative self-efficacy. In the proposed model, passion and curiosity determine creative self-efficacy. Based on the approach of design science research, a two-day course was developed and conducted. The sample consisted of students that in the future will implement information systems. The proposed model was evaluated with Partial Least Squares at the end of the course; the result indicates that passion and curiosity explain creative self-efficacy by 47%. In addition, the variables of the model were measured before and after the intervention, and passion, curiosity, and creative self-efficacy improved after the course.
