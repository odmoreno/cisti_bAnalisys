Poker learner: Players modeling through data-mining
ABSTRACT
In recent years the game of poker has created a high interest on researchers from the artificial intelligence area. Unlike board games, poker is an incomplete information game becoming a very complex game for a virtual agent. The main objective of this work is to create a data model enabling to apply data mining techniques to obtain a poker player model (pre-flop stage). To do that we used a database from a professional poker player where the data is stored in text files. The work used CRISP-DM, performing its stages. As ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tool Talend was used and for running the data mining techniques Weka was used. As a final result, a player model was achieved with a very good ROC curve. This result, enable us to conclude that the approach is adequate for creating complete poker player models.
