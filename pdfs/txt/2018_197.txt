Access control protocols for low energy consumption mediun for wireless sensor networks
ABSTRACT
The different technological advances have led to take the pulse of the world in different scenarios, whether industrial, metropolitan, homes, human beings and even the animal world. All this is carried out through wireless sensor networks that allow measuring a variety of punctual characteristics, necessary for decision making. By having a wireless connection, the challenges that arise become more aggressive and one of the most critical is the consumption of energy, since the sensors, being limited hardware devices need communication protocols and access controls to the environment (MAC) more efficient. This article aims to indicate the most efficient Access Control protocols (MAC) in the energy field over a wireless sensor network (WSN). With this, it is expected to obtain a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the energy consumption required by each MAC protocol and offer a recommendation to increase the useful life of sensor networks, conserving energy as much as possible.
