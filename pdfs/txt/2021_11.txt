Usability evaluation of ICT in the elderly community in a living lab context using observational methods
ABSTRACT
Usually, the adoption by elderly of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products is seen as difficult and unsatisfactory. Yes, sometimes that adoption is surprisingly complete and enthusiastic, motivated by an acceptance of the use of technology in the expectation of increased continued autonomy. Identifying the factors or characteristics of products that affect that adoption is key for the development of new solutions. The Interreg SUDOE ICT4SILVER project has enabled the usability test of several technological products in senior care institutions, and created the opportunity to observe and record behavioral indicators of elderly concerning the use of technology, as well as to contribute with particular useful guidelines for the manufacturers, employing correlations and behavior observation. In this paper we describe the tests conducted on a product, we suggest an organizational pilot model, we analyze the observed behavior, we propose a reaction classification, and we register the variation with respect to the nature of the experience.
