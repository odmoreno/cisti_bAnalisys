Web traffic map of spanish municipalities: building a ranking
ABSTRACT
This paper shows the results of an investigation into the visibility on the Web sites of the 8,116 municipalities in Spain. We proceeded to identify the municipal institutional web from standard criteria and watch your traffic in Alexa index. The data are treated statistically with the development of a new index called Topgov that allows the making of a dynamic ranking web tralfic related to demographics and local economic dynamism. The results show us that there is no direct correlation between population size, economic vitality and web traffic. Large urban municipalities and cities do not occupy key positions in the ranking. The hierarchy in the size and demographic dynamism is not satisfied in this case study.
