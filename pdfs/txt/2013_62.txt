Virtual Microscope of Histology: Development of a Web System for display of Microscopic Images: Initial results
ABSTRACT
The optical microscope is a very important tool in the teaching and learning of body tissues. However, such tool is not always available in undergraduate, graduate and, in particular, in basic education level. Thus, the creation of a Virtual Atlas of Histology, coupled with broad accessibility to the Internet, allow an alternative source of information on the construction of scientific knowledge. Unlike atlas available in the literature which usually presents the image of a tissue in only one specific increase, the Virtual Microscope of Histology proposed in this study will provide an image on progressive increases in order to simulate visualization under a real microscope.
