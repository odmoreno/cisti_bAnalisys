Virtual Reality used as a learning technology: Visual simulation of the construction of a bridge deck
ABSTRACT
The interaction allowed by Virtual Reality (VR) technology, as a complement to 3D modeling, could make an end to passive attitudes of learners as an opposition to traditional teaching systems, leading to a better communication between teacher and student. VR technology was applied on the development of a didactic model concerning the construction process of bridges. The VR application allows the visual simulation of the physical progression of the work and the method of operation of the equipment applied in it. This text describes the modeling and programing processes concerning the virtual simulation the construction work of a bridge deck formed of precast beams.
