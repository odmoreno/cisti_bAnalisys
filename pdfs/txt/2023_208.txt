Development of a monitoring system of basic parameters for adaptation to the use of transtibial prosthesis
ABSTRACT
This research work presents the development of an electronic prototype for monitoring some parameters that serve as a support tool during the time that a person requires to adapt to the use of a transtibial prosthesis, the proposed device will provide to the physiotherapist, who is in charge of carrying out carry out this process, information about certain parameters that allow proper care of the stump while a person adapts to the use of the prosthesis. The data that will be obtained by means of an Arduino microcontroller and sensors interconnected to it will obtain values of body temperature, the pressure exerted on the prosthesis base, heart rate, and time of use, these data will be sent to you through communication wireless via Bluetooth to a smartphone device in which these parameters will be displayed through an application, additionally, the use of an audible alarm is proposed in case the device detects that any of the parameters presents inappropriate values, the design of the proposed prototype will allow it to be adapted to any type of prosthesis.
