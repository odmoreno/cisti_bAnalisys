Repositioning the City Brand to Address the Socio-economic Paradigm Shift Based on Sustainability: A Case Study
ABSTRACT
Among other consequences, the deterioration of the city brand causes a negative self- image, the loss of the sense of belonging, the generation of mostly pessimistic expectations about its future and the growing presence of uncertainty. For this reason, cities -such as the one in the case study- facing a socio-economic paradigm shift (closure of the largest fossil fuel-based electricity production plant in Spain) in the so-called "Energy Transition", will have to implement measures for the repositioning of their territorial brand to successfully adapt to the new framework that is emerging in the medium term.This is one of the main ways for cities with similar challenges to regain competitiveness in the global city market and restore pride of belonging in their residents.
