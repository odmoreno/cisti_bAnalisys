Information system of the university of Burgos: How to measure, knowing and deciding about the frame of the European Higher Education Area
ABSTRACT
The way of introducing the Information's Systems inside the Universities establishment as a tool to give coverage to the needs of a knowledge background for official organisms and, mainly, as support to the Direction Managers to reach a decision, presents a high degree of failure. The origin of this problematics in the frame of European Higher Education Area can be pointed out: some from the point of view of new technologies, functional and organizational others, and probably the set of all of them does that a low number of cases of success in the university environment as for the implantation of Information's Systems concern, so the need of knowing, measuring and deciding on the basis of objective information appears. In this project we introduce a model of Information's System focussed on the results and the feedback by the users, where by means of a made-to-measure development and the definition of procedures and roles of access we obtain data processing of the structure and activity of the University, principally orientated to the knowledge and follow-up of the University Degrees established in the institution.
