Transition stories : Analysis of Peruvian FTM Instagram posts
ABSTRACT
Exploratory study on the use of Instagram by young trans men from Peru to communicate about their changes and experiences. Eighteen public profiles of trans young men were found, six of them were selected considering impact (followers) in the first place, but also other social characteristics. Posts of those profiles were reviewed, then 3 young men were interviewed. The information collected allows us to improve the previously defined set of categories, find certain patterns in the forms of publication and suggest that this group could have a more prosocial and political orientation on their use of Instagram than the rest of their generation.
