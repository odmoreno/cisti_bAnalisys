Embedded System With Artificial Vision To Improve The Brick Production Process
ABSTRACT
The present research applied with a quantitative approach and with an experimental design in the pre-experimental modality, had the purpose of improving the production process through the implementation of an embedded system with artificial vision in the Ladrillos Mochica company, for which record sheets were used. , in order to measure the level of production efficiency, the percentage of perfect brick units and the percentage of production delays, before and after the implementation of the embedded system with artificial vision. The population was 5000 brick units and 24 production orders respectively, and for the development of the product the methodology based on embedded systems (MBSE) was used, following the stages of analysis, design, development, integration and testing and implementation, the which was developed from May to November 2021. The main results were the increase in the production efficiency level by 1.04, the percentage of perfect brick units increased by 5% and finally the percentage of production delays decreased by 41%. With the support of the T-Student parametric test and the Wilcoxon nonparametric test, it is concluded that this implementation significantly improves the production process.
