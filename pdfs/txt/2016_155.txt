Nowadays, many small settings as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) prefer the use of agile methodologies. However, the lack of knowledge on how to use agile methodologies results in the empirical adoption of them and therefore without implementing them in a right way. The goal of this paper is to establish a state of art regarding the tools focused on assessing if an organization has adopted and used in a right way the agile methodologies. To achieve this goal 41 tools, which were obtained as a result of performing a systematic review, were analyzed. The paper includes both the analysis performed and a discussion of the main findings.
