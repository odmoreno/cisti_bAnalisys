Fuzzy spatial maps to identify oil palm units: Spatial fuzzy maps
ABSTRACT
Oil palm is an oleaginous crop of great use in the culinary industry. Often crude oil palm is marketed as fat or vegetable oil and has a large presence in the production of biodiesel. However, the production of crude oil palm is not exempt from controversy due to its environmental impact, thanks to the massive use of fertilizers and pesticides which call into question its sustainability over time. In this paper we proposes a fuzzy spatial model for the identification of palm units, from the integration of different vegetation indexes obtained from multispectral aerial images taken at low altitude. The integration of this vegetation indexes in a single mapgrid, allowed to identify in a large number of cases points with spatial energy concentration, which indicate the presence of oil palm unit. The results of the model will allow the localized treatment and characterization of oil palm units, generating a future alternative for the reduction of pesticides and fertilizers in this type of crops, ostensibly improving their environmental sustainability over time.
