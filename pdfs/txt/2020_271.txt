Lifelong Learning and Info-inclusion : Perspectives of the ageing population in the borderland region of Portugal
ABSTRACT
Lifelong learning constitutes a concern of the various governments in order to ensure that their citizens can respond to the challenges of an increasingly demanding digital society. These demands imply that in this process citizens acquire digital literacy that allows them to be included. However, all data indicate that older citizens are those with the highest levels of info-exclusion. This article aims to present the main results and conclusions of an investigation of the PerSoParAge project - Personal and social resources for autonomy and social participation in an ageing society. Citizens between 55 and 64 years oldfrom the districts of Castelo Branco, Guarda and Portalegrewere involved in this research, in order to investigate their relationship with Information and Communication Technologies and lifelong learning. It was possible to ascertain that Information and Communication Technologies can promote a more adequate social inclusion of this ageing population by giving them greater empowerment that, together with the promotion of lifelong learning, provides them with a more adequate ageing process in the digital society.
