FireViz: An application for viewing the indication of forest fires spots on a map system with APIs support
ABSTRACT
The growing increase of fires in the state of SÃ£o Paulo and the lack of computer support solutions, directly impacts the fight against these incidents. This project aims to develop an automated system for the collection, organization, dissemination and visualization of fires. This solution seeks to be a low-cost alternative to the environmental police, firefighters and fire brigades on the farms, as it does not require expensive equipment, and can help them in their investigations and preparation of combat teams. The system development process was based on gathering requirements with the environmental police in the city of Catanduva and using open data from the forest fires program of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This data was used to apply clustering algorithms which helps in the preparation and dispersion of combat teams. The application was completed and evaluated through tests and demonstrations with the entities involved with the project. It is concluded that the project may modify the way the police and combatants work, since the elaborated system organizes the information in a way that creates a simple and dynamic workflow, solving the existing difficulties.
