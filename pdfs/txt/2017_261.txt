Professional guidance information system based on the theory of multiple intelligences
ABSTRACT
Properly choosing a profession is one of the greatest challenges for individuals because the repercussions of this choice can significantly alter people's lives. From this perspective, the psychology offers its instruments, aiming to provide reflection and self-knowledge through professional guidance. The work of professional guidance leads the subject to know himself, in the sense of enabling a choice more lucid, mature, adjusted and according to the abilities of each individual. Information about the cognitive resources that people deem to be available may be relevant to a decision-making in relation to professional life, since each profession requires certain skills and competences for it to be exercised [5]. In this sense, an information system was developed for the professional guidance of the students of the Federal Institute of Goi√°s, considering the theory of multiple intelligences of the psychologist Howard Gardner of Harvard University. With this system, the IFG can effectively help its students in the choice of their professions.
