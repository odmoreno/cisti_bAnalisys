Data Tool for Exploring Gender Violence in Ecuador: Insights from a Qualitative Observation
ABSTRACT
Violence against women (VAW) is a major problem worldwide, with significant negative impacts on the physical, psychological, and social well-being of survivors. One of the key challenges in addressing VAW is the lack of mechanisms to make the data available accessible and easy to interpret. Data visualization techniques and tools can play a crucial role in supporting understanding of this issue and raising awareness. We present the results of a qualitative observation conducted with 34 individuals who used a visualization tool to explore the 2019 Survey on Family Relations and Violence Against Women in Ecuador. The tool enhanced participants’ understanding of the prevalence, types, and scope of gender violence in Ecuador and its impact on women’s lives. We also discuss the implications of our observations and the potential and limitations of data visualization tools for addressing these and similar social issues.
