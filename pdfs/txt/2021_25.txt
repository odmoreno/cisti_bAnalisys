CO2 emissions, and forest, the effect of internet use and ICT on pollution
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between the use of the internet, the export of ICTs and the GDP per capita both in CO2 emissions and in deforestation. Information from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru was used to expose this relationship. For the first model, the results showed that both the expressions of TICs and Foreign Direct Investment in the short term have detrimental effects on CO2 emissions, however in the long term, these emissions would begin to decrease, fulfilling the inverted U of Kuznets. in the case of TICs exportations, but not for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as the coefficient was not significant. For the second Model, the use of the internet in the short term would have a negative effect on the recovery of the forest, increasing its use, but in the long term, there would be a recovery of the forest. In the same way, for the GDP per capita, in the short term, there would be a positive effect for the recovery of the forest, but in the long term, there would be a deterioration. As a recommendation, the importance of the production of high-tech products is highlighted, since they reduce pollution in the short or long term.
