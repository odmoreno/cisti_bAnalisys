Proposing a research model for internet banking usage based on a literature review
ABSTRACT
Banking sector is highly influenced by development of the internet and networking technologies. The considerable number of studies in the field of internet banking acceptance and adoption reflects the importance of this issue for customers, stakeholders and developers of internet banking. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive overview of users' acceptance and adoption of internet banking. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 28 journal papers. Findings indicate the prevailing trend in the field, especially in developing countries. Integrated models have been found to be popular in internet banking acceptance researches. Additionally, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was the most used statistical method for analyzing data in studies. This study synthesizes the existing knowledge in the field by extracting research factors and the tested relationships in previous studies. In general 61 research factors and 127 relationships were extracted from studies. Moreover, this study suggests a new research model for future studies and highlights the gaps in this research field and then makes recommendations for future studies.
