Application for VTE stratification and risk assessment
ABSTRACT
Venous thromboembolism is a pathology that is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. An adequate thromboprophylaxis may contribute to an effective improvement of the well-being and safety of patients. One of the important factors for the prescription of a thromboprophylaxis is the determination of the risk of thromboembolism, which can be implemented in several ways, using different methodologies, namely by using risk scales. In this work, developed in the Hospital Center of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal, we describe the development and implementation of an application with two scales for the assessment and stratification of the risk of thromboembolism, to be applied in hospitalized patients (Caprini scale) and in patients in ambulatory surgery (scale recommended by the Portuguese Ambulatory Surgery Association). The application was integrated into the hospital electronic health record system (SClínico).
