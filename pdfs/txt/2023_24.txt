In-Depth Analysis of Mobile Apps Statistics: A Study and Development of a Mobile App
ABSTRACT
With the popularity of smartphones and mobile devices, mobile application (a.k.a. “app”) markets have been growing exponentially in terms of the number of users and downloads. To increase user satisfaction, app developers invest a lot of work into gathering and utilizing user input. This paper presents an analysis of the mobile app market through the development of a mobile app. The app provides users with an overview of the most important statistics, including the best apps in each category, the categories with the most apps, and the overall statistics. The data was collected through the analysis of publicly available annual reports, and presented in a user-friendly format through the use of graphics. The focus of the study was to provide a useful tool for developers and individuals seeking specific statistics. Although the approach has proven to be effective, the authors suggest potential, such as incorporating live data from the Google Play Store and analysing the App Store. Additionally, comparing the data from multiple years can provide useful insights into the evolution of the market.
