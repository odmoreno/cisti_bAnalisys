Design and Simulation in NS-3 of Radio Access Technology with Satellite Backhaul for Implementation in Rural Exploitations
ABSTRACT
This work consists of designing and simulating a wireless network of sensors and actuators (WSAN) for its implementation in rural aquaculture exploitation areas, where the main problem is access to other terrestrial return network services. The NS-3 network simulation software will be used to design the Radio Access Network and define general characteristics of the Satellite Return Network. The results are evaluated based on the power consumption parameters of the different nodes, throughput at the MAC layer level, percentage of packets lost, and transmission delay. Finally, a cumulative distribution function is shown that compares the delay generated in the transmission for different qualities of synchronously transmitted video.
