Issues in using Internet in remote South African high schools
ABSTRACT
This case study analyzes the availability and uses of teaching techniques and computing technologies in Grades 10, 11, and 12 Computer Applications Technology classes in a remote town in South Africa. The technologies and techniques trialed showed promise of usefulness in being more engaging to student interest than those presently used. The technologies were a bit tricky in setting up and it was recommended that the researchers, in addition to special work sessions with the teachers, team taught with the teachers for their first time using the technologies. Human factors issues focused on ease of use and intuitiveness of technologies for both teachers and students. With 50-minute classes, if the technology becomes a hurdle rather than a vehicle for teaching a class concept, it defeats its own purpose. Thus, to be successful, technologies need to be selected carefully, installed, tested, and ready for use.
