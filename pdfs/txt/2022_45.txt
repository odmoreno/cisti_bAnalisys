StoreMe-MR: Toolbox for intelligent warehouse control in the industry 4.0 with mixed reality
ABSTRACT
Industry 4.0 represents one of the key factors for digital transformation and, proof of this is, every day, more and more companies are digitizing their processes to improve them, maximize their performance and gain a competitive advantage. This digitization leads to explore new technologies and how to adapt them to productive operations so, the operators can be able to perform their tasks more and more efficiently. StoreMe-MR is a toolbox whose main objective is to bring technology and production processes closer together, making it possible to manage a warehouse in an optimal way without interfering with the actions performed by an operator. To achieve this, StoreMe-Mr uses mixed reality technology together with the benefits of artificial intelligence algorithms to provide the end user with all the information he needs in real time. Tests of StoreMe-MR in a laboratory environment show promising results to be considered as one of the essential tools in an operatorâ€™s day-to-day life.
