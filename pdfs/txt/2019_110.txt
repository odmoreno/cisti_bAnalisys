Data collection in SDN networks with contextual analysis
ABSTRACT
The concept of Context-based networks allows enriching the network management since it considers the global state (context) of the computational system through the characteristics of the user, network and presentation devices providing a broader approach for traffic optimization. In this work we propose the application of a context-based traffic optimization solution called Context-Aware Adaptive Routing Framework (CAARF-SDN). The goal of this paper is to present a solution for context notifications recovery from the computational system which is applied within CAARF-SDN. These context notifications are related to information of Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Device (QoD) and estimated Quality of Experience (QoE), which will result in a new metric called Quality of Context (QoC). As a result, this metric is applied to assess traffic optimization in an SDN network.
