Service elicitation of non-functional requirements: An approach using activity theory
ABSTRACT
The elicitation of non-functional requirements (generic qualities of services) in the design and maintenance of services is an issue that has to be analysed under the perspective of the business (e.g. marketing, production, etc.) and information systems (e.g. requirements engineering, networks, etc.). In general, the solutions approach the final analysis service requirements at the expense of capturing the initial customer requirements. This article contributes to the capture of the initial requirements through service observation by a systemic approach. This requires an approach supported in Activity Theory (AT). Thus it is intended to facilitate the capture of nonfunctional requirements from the context, taking into account human practices, such as a social and historical development process (AT). As a demonstration of the proposal, this was applied to a case study.
