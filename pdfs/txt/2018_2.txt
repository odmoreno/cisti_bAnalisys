A cloud platform for food sensory estimations based on artificial intelligence techniques
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present ICatador, a software platform witch make easier the cheese quality control activities. Currently, food quality control can be performed with sensory evaluations or organoleptics of products. Due to this fact, a panel of professional tasters, previously trained, evaluate sensory attributes (appearance, smell, aroma, ...) for the quality control of this product. These activities are tedious, costly and time consuming to carry out. With ICatador tool is possible to virtualize the quality control activities of cheeses, it make that they can be carried out more efficiently and on-line, making possible the total quality control of manufactured products. Through ICatador the food industry has a range of services to ensure consumer acceptance of the product.
