Technologies of learning and knowledge for the interconnected education of students of the University of Guayaquil
ABSTRACT
The study arises from the challenges imposed by society to an interconnected education, for which a more efficient and innovative learning is required; its objective was to determine the form of use and learning generated by learning and knowledge technologies used for the interconnected education of students at the University of Guayaquil. As a methodology, a quantitative development was proposed, with field modality, descriptive type, a questionnaire of twenty items and Likert scale was used. The sample was chosen with stratified sampling, it was made up of 461 students. As results, it was found that the apprentices use diverse technological resources; however, it is necessary to promote the use of social networks as a resource to enhance learning; enthusiasm was almost always fostered; however, these learners must propose actions that lead to the construction of knowledge. In the adaptive learning activities, a lack was evidenced in the application of the diversity of evaluations and in the flexibility of the content. The study of the dimension: generated learning allowed to observe that the apprentices do not have the possibility of a rhizomatic learning, only sometimes they have the possibility of a nomadic learning; and, they almost never have the possibility of carrying out their educational process through open learning ecosystems. In conclusion, the form of use and learning generated by learning and knowledge technologies in the students of the University of Guayaquil are not adequate to the demands of an interconnected education.
