Design of a prototype for modelling membrane computation based on ecosystems in a cloud environment
ABSTRACT
This short presents a prototype based on the PSysCal tool [1] to help ecologists in their daily tasks. One of these tasks consists of modeling the interaction between different species in complex ecosystems. Nowadays, the current tools that allow this task to be performed, such as PSysCal, require huge amounts of computational resources, and also a great deal of computer knowledge to configure the program correctly. Overcoming these obstacles is the main objective of this prototype. Developing this prototype in a cloud environment [2][3] solves the problem of computational resources and supplies the chance to provide more accessible and user-friendly web services. Thus, the implementation of a user-friendly web portal solves the difficulties of configuring the tool and facilitates the ecologist work.
