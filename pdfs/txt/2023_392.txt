Functional Design of a Location-Validated Citizen e-Participation Platform
ABSTRACT
The forms and styles of government have traditionally been framed in the participation of citizens through their representatives, who have been elected through democratic elections. These representations, in some cases, have not been able to ensure that citizens are heard and actively taken into account in the decision-making process of the authorities, causing a state of discomfort and indifference among citizens. Access to Internet services is an important factor to formulate proposals for citizen participation, since voters already have a mechanism to contribute with their criteria through online applications. This article presents “Yo Participo”, as a functional design of a multiplatform citizen participation application, which contributes in an agile way to the management of electronic government, where users and authorities can coordinate actions for the good of society. The platform was developed with agile methods, allowing to validate its design and applicability of this participation tool.
