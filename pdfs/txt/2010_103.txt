A conceptual model of E-local government
ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a new conceptual model of e-Local Government for the Portuguese municipalities of small population - less than 10,000 residents - supported by wireless technologies. The proposed model allows evaluating the degree of digitization of the interactive process of the municipality and its residents. Thus, a municipality may implement the proposed model of e-government to undertake an organizational change and implement the process automation inherent to electronic interaction, being always borne in wireless technologies. This contribution is set within the spirit of the development approach to reduce regional asymmetries in Portugal.
