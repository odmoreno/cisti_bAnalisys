Portfolio assessment to evaluate outcomes of learning in the e-learning environment
ABSTRACT
In recent decades there has been a significant growth in the use of e-learning as a tool that allows institutions to reach more students with no geographical limitation. Recent research results have shown that constant assessment positively encourages this type of education, generating satisfaction in users of these technologies. The tool most widely used in this context for assessment are objective tests, particularly the tests single or multiple choice. But these are not sufficient to evaluate the different knowledge levels that arise as targets (like the levels in Bloom's taxonomy). Given this, it is necessary to have tools that allow for different types of assessment. This paper presents a proposal to implement portfolios assessment in e-learning environments. It consists of a semantic model that describes a tool to the creation, administration and performance of portfolios.
