Impact of Human Capital and Technology in Human Development Index in Latin American
ABSTRACT
This research shows evidence of the impact n between Human Capital and Technology in the Human Development Index (HDI) of Latin America. To demonstrate the existing relationship, panel data from 12 Latin American countries were used, disaggregated into 3 groups of 4 countries according to their income, (According to the Atlas method of the World Bank) that is, high-income countries (Chile, Panama, Uruguay, Mexico), middle-income (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador) and low-income (Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua). The results reflected that the technology variable positively influences the HDI in low- and middle-income countries, corroborating the theory, the effect being greater in the countries of the latter group. However, high-income countries show a negative relationship between technology and the HDI. As a Policy recommendation, governments should be concerned with the Promotion of human capital and opportunities for access to technology individually, to improve the quality of life.
