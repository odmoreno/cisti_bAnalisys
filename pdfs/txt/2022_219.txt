A new survillance architecture based on home cameras : A video streaming framework for handling distribute IP cameras through internet while keeping privacy
ABSTRACT
For being considered smart, cities must implement technology and innovation in each service that they should provide to citizens. One of those service is security, which is based on distributing cameras through the city and mounting monitoring centers with plenty of video-operators. Making such infrastructure expand could be impossible for many cities due to the high cost, so they need new ways for reaching that purpose. In this work, we propose a new surveillance infrastructure that take advantage of the already existent citizens cameras located in a public or semi-spaces: street, building gate, commercial location, among others. We describe the required software components for the implementation of such system. Preliminary studies are carried out, considering technical considerations to make this feasible, making a analysis of the computational effort and bandwidth requirements for such system.
