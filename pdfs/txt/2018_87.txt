Portuguese digital opinion leaders and its impact, in the promotion of products, services and events in social networks
ABSTRACT
The evolution of social networks made the brands start using DOL (Digital Opinion Leaders) as their voice. The function of DOL is to communicate to their followers what brands have to offer. With this article, we want to understand if the promotion of products, services and events made by DOL, on social networks, has positive impact on brands or not. With a quantitative study, based on an online questionnaire, with 200 participants, it was possible to conclude that brands should use LOD as their representatives. However, it is important that the brand choose partners with a good relationship with the followers and someone who really knows the content of what is advertised.
