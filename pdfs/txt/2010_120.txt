Dynamic scripting applied to a First-Person Shooter
ABSTRACT
Video game Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing more complex and realistic to keep up with player requirements. Despite this, most games still fail to provide true adaptability in their AI, resulting in situations where an intermediate level player is able to predict the AI's behavior in a short amount of time, leading to a predictable and boring game experience. Creating a truly adaptive AI would greatly benefit a videogame's intrinsic value by providing a more immersive and unpredictable game experience. This paper describes the development of an AI system for the First-Person Shooter (FPS) videogame genre that avoids this problem through the creation of adaptable rule-based behaviors, enabling AI characters to learn the best strategy for any given situation..
