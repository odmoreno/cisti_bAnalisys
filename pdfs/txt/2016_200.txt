State-of-the-art in wearable technology: Medical area applications
ABSTRACT
Actually there are more technological devices in our lives which may vary from glasses, a ring or to a technological shirt. Such development represents an innovation in miniaturizing technological components to such a point where they can be used as accessories we use in everyday life; meaning this, Wearable Technology consists in the incorporation of technological components in clothing accessories or objects we carry. This implies that Wearable Technology is a subarea of Internet of Things since it incorporates physical objects with sensors and software that allows them to exchange data without human intervention. This is the case of the devices that increasingly are being developed for the medical area, especially because of the growing number of patients overloading hospitals and medical centers.
