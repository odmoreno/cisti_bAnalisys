Off-Line Voice Assistant for Silver Tourism
ABSTRACT
The world’s population is showing an aging trend. So much so that this will become one of the most significant social transformations of the 21st century. Its consequences affect almost all sectors of society, from the labor and financial markets to family structures and tourism. There is no doubt that this demographic change is a major challenge, but also an opportunity that seeks to take advantage of this new market niche, the so-called Silver Economy. In this line, the tourism sector has to adapt its offer to the Silver Economy, and more specifically to the Silver Tourists, by offering an aging-friendly offer adapted to the environment and taking advantage of new technologies. Today, one of the best ways to access updated tourist information is through chatbots and voice assistants that can offer a new intelligent interface that has all the tourist offers updated in real-time. However, there are large rural areas where there is no Internet connectivity. This circumstance limits tourists’ access to the Internet and, consequently, to all information. In order to favor the access to tourist information and associated services to this new target of tourists, this work aims to carry out research tasks with the purpose of designing a new technological solution based on voice assistants without Internet connection that allows providing all the relevant tourist information in an updated way to the tourists in question.
