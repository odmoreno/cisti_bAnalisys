Model for Risk Assessment in Dams with Fuzzy Sets Application
ABSTRACT
Risk management involves both objective and subjective factors. In principle, objective factors are expressed by numerical values being classified by limit values or ranges, while subjective factors express values that can hardly be represented numerically. The problem of evaluation tends to worsen when events must be compared, and a selection or ordering must be performed. For this reason, the importance of considering defined processes to help select and prioritize those who are most relevant to the institution. The current work presents a proposal of solution to help manage the demands related to the process of inspection and classification of dam safety in a regulatory agency. The method, by application of Decision Making in Fuzzy Environment, had as objective to indicate which projects should be prioritized by the inspection team, based on criteria from common terms used in your daily routine. Its application allowed to measure and guarantee the consistency of the judgments along the process, minimizing risks, promoting more rationalization and administrative transparency.
