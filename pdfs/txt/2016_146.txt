Innovation in Spanish regional broadcasters: Challenges and strategies
ABSTRACT
The twelve public local broadcasters from Spain get on the train of innovation to strengthen its mission, create added value from public investment and deliver quality to audiences on a stage convulsing before another technological revolution that has upside down models of production and distribution of audiovisual content via television. This research aims to know the strategies of the twelve corporations in relation to the production and distribution of public service content and deepen the challenges for the coming years. All this without losing sight of the budget and legitimacy pressures to which they are subject, with more intensity from the beginning of the economic crisis, and especially those that do not bind their existence to the identity and own language of the autonomous region they operate. Results obtained show that public local media from Spanish historical nationalities-Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque Country-, together with Andalusia, are at the forefront as far as innovation is concerned, even though the challenges European public media are facing.
