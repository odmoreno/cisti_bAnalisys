Google analytics for time behavior measurement in Moodle
ABSTRACT
The shift to e-learning and online education requires new and different approaches for tracking student performance and behavior. Moodle is currently the leading virtual learning environment in Spain, and a lot of different plugins have appeared to complement the lack of native tools to track the learning process in all its aspects. However, none of these take the temporal dimension as a possible behavior measurement into consideration. In this case study, a new technical and statistical approach to time tracking of students in Moodle will be discussed, so that time as a behavioral aspect can be considered in further assessments. Furthermore, this approach could not only be applied to Moodle, but to all other online virtual learning environments.
