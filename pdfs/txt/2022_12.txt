3D Modeling for virtual tour of a Higher Education Institution
ABSTRACT
The pandemic caused by COVID 19 has generated crowds of people, this becomes a critical point that leads to a safe contagion. And it is for this reason that the idea of a virtual tour was born so that people can get to know the physical facilities of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) through a virtual environment. Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Israel (UISRAEL), does not have a digital space where its different areas can be appreciated by means of a 3D virtual tour. In this sense, this work presents the development of a 3D model, offering the user a digital interaction of the physical space from his home on his computer. The main benefit is that the user can get to know the facilities in an almost real way, generating a sense of orientation. This work has given way to a future virtual community at UISRAEL, making it possible to diversify and face the new challenges that virtualization brings with it. It will not only be a new means of information and communication, but also a space for interaction, entertainment and learning. All this leaves the basis for an application that in the future could develop more functionalities and be used in other research projects.
