Education by technological intervals in higher education: TIHE model
ABSTRACT
The accelerated changes in society and the advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), while posing great challenges, offer enormous potential for transforming education. ICTs, in some countries has influenced and changed Higher Education. However, one of the features of this new methodology using ICTs to work in class, is mixing the traditional learning process with the virtual education in which students can search information on internet related with the topic that are studying during the class. This can motivates students and can result in a more efficient learning process. Many researches, especially with the constructivist paradigm in learning process, emphasize learning as an internal process, carried out by those who learn by themselves, as an active process of knowledge construction, which cannot be acquired passively. That is why the objective of the article is to propose a model for learning environments using technologies that guarantee the motivation and experimentation of a student of Higher Education.
