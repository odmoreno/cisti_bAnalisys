Algorithm for model the soil arching effect on discontinuous soil retaining walls
ABSTRACT
Soil arching effect is a physical phenomenon that allows self-retain to the soil by mean of discontinuous earth retaining structures used to the construction of foundation piles for high-rise buildings. To analyze this phenomenon, a two-dimensional (2D) simplified analysis is currently used, although it offers a mathematical approximation to the solution of the problem, their results significantly reduce the accuracy of the physical model. This article shows an algorithm developed to model the three - dimensional (3D) soil arching effect on the gravel of Santiago de Chile. The algorithm is implemented in a finite element software. This methodology provides more accurate results in the models, which considerably reduces the risk of landslides and optimizes the use of resources in the construction of discontinuous retaining structures. With this contribution it is also possible to establish a new design algorithm for the use of structural engineers that are more accuracy in their results with greater precision in calculations, due to the three-dimensional (3D) model developed. Thus, it can be seen that technology is engaged in everyday activities of structural engineers, providing high reliability information for the decision making respect to the structural design of retaining structures.
