The touristsâ€™ sensory experiences: preliminary insights of urban areas of Porto, Portugal
ABSTRACT
The preliminary study aims to capture meaningful sensory impressions of the urban tourist environment. Exploring the five human senses and their role in the creation of experience, knowledge, and perspective has been a trending subject of discussion in different research disciplines. Studies in marketing management recognize the importance of multisensory stimuli in the formation of positive customer experience i.e., sensory marketing. In tourism studies, the assumption is that destinations, as well as products, can be branded. The destination sensory branding can stimulate positive tourist experience, memory, and contribute to local sustainable development. However, there is a lack of empirical research on multisensory experience in the context of urban tourism. A self-administered survey in three languages was collected from 305 national and international tourists who have visited Porto. A content analysis produces different sensory impressions for each sense i.e., sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The findings suggest that urban areas are rich in multisensory cues that could encourage sense and memory of a destination.
