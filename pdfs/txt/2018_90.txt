Design of smart stretchers and vital signs monitoring system for reduced-mobility patients
ABSTRACT
Technology advances have been focused for the last few years in different areas. For medical care, these technological advantages could provide mechanisms to obtain and process data that determine important clinical aspects of the patients. The purpose of this study is to emphasis on the main features of a smart stretcher prototype controlled by voice commands, and vital signs monitoring system for disabled persons or reduced mobility patients. Raspberry Pi and Arduino are the selected devices for processing the data, which are integrated to the data collecting software in order to develop a global system. The key contribution of this prototype is to facilitate medical treatments to the patients, since this system is developed by using affordable technology and merging different functions to offer a pragmatic solution.
