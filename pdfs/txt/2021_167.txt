Impulse Buying: Psychological, Social and Technological Factors
ABSTRACT
Despite the growth of electronic commerce to the most remote areas and the growing orientation of societies towards consumption, there still seems to be a significant failure in the understanding and validation of assumptions about impulse buying and its psychological, social and technological factors, especially in the online context. With this study, it is intended to understand the impact of personality, subjective well-being, influencers, website quality and sociodemographic variables on the Consumer's online impulsive buying tendency. For this purpose, an investigation will be conducted in Portuguese territory. It is expected to establish links between the previous variables and Consumerâ€™s online impulsive buying tendency, contributing to the advancement of research on online impulse buying in the light of Marketing, Psychology, Sociology and Technology.
