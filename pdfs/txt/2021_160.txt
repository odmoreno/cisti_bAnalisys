Design and Simulation in OMNET ++ of a Wireless Sensor Network for Rural Exploitation Zones
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, low power consumption wide area networks (LPWAN) have achieved great versatility in their implementation for IoT applications in areas of difficult access and large extensions. LoRaWAN is one of the technologies that under this concept provides us long-range coverage and low energy consumption that operates in free ISM bands without any cost. Through the OMNeT ++ network simulation platform, it is possible to obtain performance indicators such as the data extraction rate (DER), energy consumed by nodes, loss of packets, among others that allow to determine the appropriate location of the nodes and gateways in a wireless sensor network (WSN). This work aims to simulate the use of a LoRa network as radio access technology (RAT) in different sizes of typical shrimp exploitation scenarios in extensive rural areas. The data obtained from performance indicators is analyzed based on the behavior of the simulation for a correct location of water quality sensor spots inside the scenario.
