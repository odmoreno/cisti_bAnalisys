Emotional states and relationship with the educational sense and usefulness of information and communication technologies in university students
ABSTRACT
The study’s objective was to determine how information and communication technologies, through the sense of utility and the educational sense, relate to the student’s emotional states. Research is not an experiment and is based on numbers. A sample of 102 first-year university students in general studies was used. The methodology that was used had two well-defined phases: first, an Exploratory Factor Analysis was carried out with the objective of condensing the information of the original variables into smaller series; secondly, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis was carried out that allowed internal consistency tests of the model to be carried out using non-parametric statistics; correlation and linear regression tests were performed. It can be said that the educational and utilitarian uses of information and communication technologies give different explanations for changes in emotional states.
