Why Building Information Modelling and why now : Literacy study of BIM implementation in architecture
ABSTRACT
This paper is part of an investigation related to the implementation of BIM (Building Information Modelling) in the undergraduate levels of Architecture and Building Engineering studies. Since the knowledge and use of these technologies is required (and sometimes mandatory) at a professional level, the objective of the research is to confirm that the use of students of the described grades. This research conducts a study of the current status of BIM implementation in Spanish universities and an initial review of the scientific interest of these processes from publications that relate the concepts of such research: educational improvement, BIM implementation, and the framework of construction sector. The results demonstrate the need to continue with the study for an improvement in the implementation process and for a better acquisition of the skills that students will need in their professional incorporation, both in a scientific framework of constant assessment of processes.
