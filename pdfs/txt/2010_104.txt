Conceptual framework for the construction and evaluation of data warehouses
ABSTRACT
The main goal of this paper is to report the results of a literature review about the most adopted architectures of Data Warehouse by the business organizations. The methodologies followed in implementing those architectures were also studied. This work allowed to contribute to this paper with a conceptual framework in order to support the selection of the architecture to adopt by the organization. The hierarchical level of organization that is supposed the Data Warehouse to support, the domain in which is applied, the profile of users that will use the Data Warehouse infrastructure and the potential software vendors were considered. A comparison between different architectures, through the dimensions of time and cost is also conducted. Finally, some items to evaluate the performance of a Data Warehouse are still listed.
