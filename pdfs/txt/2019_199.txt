An Internet of Things Approach for Environmental Quality Management and Laboratory Activity Support
ABSTRACT
Environmental conditions have a significant impact on health and all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterized by various sources of pollution that can lead to unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, laboratory activities, especially in the case of experiments using thermography, require the supervision of several parameters. The proliferation of the Internet of Things paradigm (IoT) shows great potential for the creation of automatic solutions for monitoring indoor environments. In general, people spend about 90% of their time inside buildings so it is significant to use realtime monitoring systems in order to identify bad ambient conditions. The timely detection of poor ambient conditions allows you to plan interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health. This paper aims to present a laboratory environment conditions supervision solution based on IoT architecture called iLabM+. The solution is composed of prototype hardware for the collection of the data environment and a Web portal for data consulting and analysis. This system allows monitoring of temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and air quality. The results obtained are promising and represent a significant contribution to IoT-based environmental quality monitoring systems.
