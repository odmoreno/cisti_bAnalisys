Ukucha: a video game for teaching experimental psychology
ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced educational institutions to find a way to meet educational needs, within these those for experimentation. This article implements a video game for teaching experimental psychology in a private university. The research is of an applied type and experimental design. For the development of the software, the SUM methodology was used for the development of the video game and the OOHDM methodology for the development of the web page according to the video game. Additionally, cutting-edge tools have been considered to be able to make a scalable and robust application such as the use of Unreal Engine 4 in its version 4.27 for the development of the video game, Blender in its version 3.0 for 3D modeling and character animation, Django as a framework Python for web development in conjunction with PostgreSQL for the elaboration of the database through the software architecture Model Vista Template (MVT).
