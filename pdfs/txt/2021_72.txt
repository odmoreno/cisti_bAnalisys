Comparative Performance Analysis of NoSQL Cassandra and MongoDB Databases
ABSTRACT
As communication technologies evolve, increasing convergences between them, it is essential that there are flexible and scalable infrastructures capable of storing and processing the millions of data that are produced daily through the massive use of mobile applications and social networks. NoSQL databases are becoming an alternative to store those data. In this paper two experiments that aim to compare the performance of the Cassandra and MongoDB databases are presented. In the first experiment, we tested the performance using the YCSB tool with three workloads and found that Cassandra had the best performance. While in the second experiment, we simulate operations to a database of investors from the Tesouro Nacional (National Treasury), to answer some questions and check the performance at run time, then the MongoDB database had the best results in most operations. The results are presented in this paper.
