Improvement to the Papeat software of the gastronomy sector based on Intelligence using Tableau
ABSTRACT
Gastronomy in Peru is considered one of the most competitive sectors in the country and of great importance for its economy. In order to improve the management of its processes and have greater visualization, many businesses have adopted technological solutions, including the use of the Papeat cloud platform. The problem is that this platform lacks functionalities that provide integrated information from the various areas of the business with indicators that allow comparative analysis and proper decision making, therefore, the objective of this work is to incorporate new features to ERP Papeat using a Business Intelligence solution integrating data from different areas in a Data Mart in the cloud to provide reports and/or dashboard to support decision making in gastronomic companies. The methodology used is that of Ralph Kimball, which is based on the business life cycle that will simplify the implementation of a business intelligence solution using the tableau tool. The main result was to reduce the report generation time by almost $100 \%$ (from two days to a few seconds) with detailed information, and to be displayed through a dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) which helps to make better decisions.
