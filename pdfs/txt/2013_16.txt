Agile software project: Proposal of a model to manage risks
ABSTRACT
Risk is inherent in all software projects. To manage and control them represents gains for the development and success of projects. The risk management goal is to control, in a continue way, the risks that arise in all the phases of projects, and it's considered determinant to the projects' success. The risk management process is defined through models that specify the activities to accomplish during the project, with the aim to eliminate or minimize the impact of risks. Given the popularity of agile approaches, agile risk management has become central, because agile methodologies by themselves don't give an answer to the risks that might arise in a software project. The work presented in this article has a goal the definition of a risk management model, suited to agile development, in order to improve the existing risk management.
