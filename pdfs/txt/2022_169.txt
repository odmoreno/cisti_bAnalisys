Absorption capacities in Ecuadorian companies: Identification of profiles
ABSTRACT
This article aims to identify the absorptive capacity profiles and their association with innovation in Ecuadorian companies. The cluster method was applied to determine the profiles, the sample was made up of xx companies and their association was determined through a comparison of means analysis. The main result is the composition of 3 different clusters of different intensities in their absorptive and innovation capacity, cluster 1 shows that a greater absorptive capacity is associated with a better innovation capacity.
