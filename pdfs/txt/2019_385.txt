Location-Based Games on Active Aging: A Systematic Review
ABSTRACT
The entertainment industry has joined several others to bring a greater commitment to their activities, such as games with health and education. With the current demographic trends, the older adult audience is a part that should have special attention, especially with all the factors that contribute to aging. It is noted that digital games may have an impact on the health of older adults, but little research has been done on location-based mobile games and this audience. This article reviews the literature focusing on the effects that location-based mobile games have on the lives of seniors and how these investigations are being conducted. There were five studies that investigate this category of games with the aspects related to health and the social interaction of senior citizens. Such researches conduct projects in development basis using user-centered design and Survey methods for data collection.
