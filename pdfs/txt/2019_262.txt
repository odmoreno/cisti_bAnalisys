Investigating the effect of learning styles on the acceptance of e-books among university students
ABSTRACT
The objective of this study is to analyse the effects of learning styles on the acceptance of the use of e-books among university students. Data were collected from 153 engineering students in Chile through a face-to-face survey based on the Felder-Silverman learning styles model and Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour. Through a two-steps cluster analysis, students were classified into three segments based on their learning styles. Next, the differences between the segments in the behaviour model were analysed, using the technique of structural equations Partial Least Squares. The study results indicate that there are differences in the acceptance behaviour of e-books associated with the distinct learning profiles.
