Supportive metrics to estimate the effort to develop Business Intelligence system
ABSTRACT
Goal: This work aims to identify metrics to estimate the effort to develop Business Intelligence (BI) system. Methodology: It was conducted a secondary study in order to identify metrics related to BI and to business process complexity. The results conducted to a hypothesis that relates business process complexity to effort required to implement it on BI System. This hypothesis was developed on a case study. Results: The hypothesis was verified and seems to be true, but more studies are required to confirm the relation. It was also proposed a method that explore this relation. By using the method it is possible to estimate the effort to implement BI System. Conclusions: This work emphasizes the importance of measuring BI Systems and it is an information source to academics and BI system developers that want to increase their effort estimative precision.
