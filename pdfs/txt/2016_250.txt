Visibilized thematics via Twitter by the Government of Chile: Two cases of corruption
ABSTRACT
The aim of this work is to thematically classify the messages posted by the @GobiernodeChile and @Segegob Twitter accounts. The study was conducted in two distinct periods, but both characterized by having attracted media attention for being the last two cases of corruption in Chile. The first one is the Penta case, which allowed the irregular financing of election campaigns of politicians mainly from right-wing. The second case is about influence peddling involving the son of President Bachelet. This is important because if we detect an inequity in the treatment of both cases, we can see that this platform is not built as a universal public space where subjects have no place.
