Website Accessibility of Portuguese Travel Agents
ABSTRACT
This study aims to analyse the website accessibility of travel agents (TA)located in the Central Region of Portugal. A sample of 182 websites was analysed based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)2.0 and using the AccessMonitor and TAW automatic evaluation tools. This analysis was made considering the AAA conformance level of WCAG. Results reveal that website accessibility of the travel agents analysed is low. Moreover, several problems and warnings were identified and perceivable and robust principles emerged as the most critical. These results suggested that web designers should incorporate web accessibility guidelines in TA websites to make information available to all people independently of their needs, preferences, skills and personal situation or conditions of access.
