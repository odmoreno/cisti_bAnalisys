Values, transparency, and corporate governance as a fundamental axis of the management of corporate social responsibility in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
The implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in organizations requires the execution of various actions aimed at generating favorable indicators in the economic, social, and, environmental environments. These actions must promote the management of the various interest groups, as well as the establishment of an identity based on sustainability. For this, companies need to have guides and principles that allow them to mark a course of action, one of these guides is given by the Ethos indicators, through which companies can self-detect and undertake improvement strategies. Among several aspects that Ethos analyzes, there is the indicator of values, transparency, and corporate governance as the initial axis of CSR. This document analyzes the performance of Ecuadorian companies in terms of compliance with the indicator of values, transparency, and corporate governance. The investigation included a total of 326 companies, both micro, small, medium and large throughout the country. The questionnaire was applied to the managers or representatives of the organizations object of this study.
