Is influencer marketing still influential?
ABSTRACT
At the beginning of the pandemic caused by Covid-19, during the first semester of 2020, many predicted the end of the reign of influencers, and of their role as key players in the brand communication process. A year later, in March 2021, it can be stated that those forecasts were not accurate, and that this communication tool is still alive and generating profits.This article will provide a document review intending, on one hand, to define and elaborate on the concept influencer marketing, and to explain the way it operates; and, on the other, to compile information to determine whether it is still as important as a customer relationship technique, as it was before this health crisis.
