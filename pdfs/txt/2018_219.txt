Methodological application of business intelligence M3S: Case empresa El√©ctrica Quito E.E.Q
ABSTRACT
The fact of not having a clear method to be efficient in the search of decisions in business intelligence (IN) generates high costs in the use of resources. Therefore, computer science came to solve this problem by means of a branch of itself which is artificial intelligence and a sub field such as Automatic Learning (A-A). In the present paper we will define a methodology called M3S of IN, in which an appropriate procedure to follow is determined to have the best results in the extraction of data, to obtain greater knowledge and value in the information. This methodology will be based on the ID3 algorithm of decision trees which is based on mathematical concepts such as entropy and information gain within the analysis of the best attributes that can be considered for decision making.
