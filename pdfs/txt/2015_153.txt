Defining requirements for an atrial fibrillation screening system that implements tele-holtering on a cloudified infrastructure
ABSTRACT
This work intends to define requirements to design, deploy, evaluate and validate the feasibility, efficiency and safety of an enriched telecardiology application for providing remotely ECG and Holter diagnostic/monitor services as atrial fibrillation screening. The platform must include supporting tools for e-learning that allow to operate the solution by general practitioners and patients for second opinion, best follow-up through home monitoring and on-line learning, boosted by an on-demand virtualized data recording and training infrastructure, based on a cloudified infrastructure. It can be understood as an experiment that will use a cloudified infrastructure to deploy new telecardiology related services, particularly for atrial fibrillation patients that could be monitorized from several ambulatories.
