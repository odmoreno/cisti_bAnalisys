IP3 â€“ building a global ICT profession
ABSTRACT
The International Professional Practice Partnership (IP3) was formed by IFIP in 2007 to fulfil the objective of creating a global IT Profession. This paper will contextualize the work of IP3 by examining: why an ICT profession is needed and why it should be on a global basis; what is a global profession; and the progress made by IP3 in establishing a global ICT profession. The paper concludes by discussing the similarities between IP3 and the much longer established Washington Accord structure used by the engineering profession.
