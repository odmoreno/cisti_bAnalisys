The Accountant in the New Era : Renewing the profession for Society 5.0
ABSTRACT
This study explores the accountant’s role in the new digital Era and the profession’s future on the way to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With the contribution of higher education and external entities, soft and hard skills can enhance the accountant’s role, the Accountant 5.0, towards a Society 5.0. A thematic literature search approach explored the recent views of accounting researchers and professional bodies. The literature reveals the challenges and opportunities of the accounting profession, both in the field of education and training, for teachers, educational institutions, and professional bodies. Therefore, the accountant should take the opportunity to improve his image in society by recreating the profession in this new digital Era on the way to the SDGs. With this study, we contribute to the literature in the field of accounting, focusing on the role played by accountants, researchers, educational institutions, teachers, organizations, and policymakers in this new Era.
