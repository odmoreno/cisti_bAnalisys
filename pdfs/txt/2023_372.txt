Bio-inspired algorithm for solving the timetabling problem in the dispatch scheduling of a distribution center with multiple loading stations
ABSTRACT
One of the main problems within the business supply chain is the management of several factors such as dispatch schedules, the optimization of the attention of orders placed for a specific schedule, the routes that multiple dispatch vehicles will take, among others, in order to meet the needs of customers. Several activities that can be optimized is the dispatch planning (timetabling dispatch problem), usually performed manually with tools such as spreadsheets, which invests time and does not facilitate the adjustment of a dispatch plan, nor does it guarantee an optimal or error-free result. In the present study, a virus colony search (VCS) algorithm for schedule allocation applied to dispatching in a plant with multiple bays has been developed. The approach is oriented to the search of maximizing the dispatch of products in the different bays, for which the dispatch orders must be prioritized and the dead time minimized, considering the different constraints such as special orders that need to be loaded at a particular time.
