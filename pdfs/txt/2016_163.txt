Improving the spatial resolution of Ikonos images based on orthophotos: An application of image fusion with wavelet transform
ABSTRACT
This article aims to develop and evaluate two methodologies that improve the spatial resolution without significant loss of spectral resolution, with an Ikonos and orthophoto image. Using the transformation RGB-IHS principal component analysis (PCA). Applying fusion to components multispectral image intensity (Im) and orthophotos (Io) by the wavelet transform. Similarly to the main component of the multispectral image (CP1M) and orthophoto (CP1o) using Wavelet transformed together with ARSIS technique a new intensity and a major new component is generated respectively. To perform the inverse transformed independently IHS-RGB and IACP, and thus obtain two multispectral images. Finally, the results obtained with the mathematical-statistical indices CC, ERGAS, RASE and Qu are presented.
