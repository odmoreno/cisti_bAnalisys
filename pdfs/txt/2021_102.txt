Impact and Concerns of Mid-Level Directors on Information Systems in the Hospital (SNS)
ABSTRACT
Today organizations depend heavily on their Information System as they have a high impact on daily operations, sustainability, and progress. Therefore, in the health sector, Information System are essential, as they support their operational and management processes. Accordingly, we highlight their main purposes, which are: to contribute to efficiency and effectiveness of the daily activities of mid-level directors and to simplify communication, improve and streamline information sharing and integrate information between different services, departments, and health services. This time, this work helped us to understand the importance given to Information System by intermediate level directors, both in the clinical area and in the management / administration area. However, in parallel, we found that there are some concerns, as of now with the diversity of applications; the lack of interoperability; the lack of adequate training; obsolescence of hardware and software, among others.In this work, we carried out two data collection approaches to mid-level Directors in the clinical area and in the management / administration area, initially semi-structured interviews and, subsequently, a mixed questionnaire.
