Factors that Explain the Use of the Spotify Service in Chile: Using the Home Technology Acceptance and Use Model (MATH)
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this work is to develop an exploratory study that identifies the determinants of household Spotify music service satisfaction. The research is based in the model of adoption of technology in household (MATH), considering an independent user satisfaction variable. The model was validated by means of a random sample of the service users, using the PLS model to perform the statistical analysis. Three main findings are observed. First, the importance of normative beliefs in the explanation of household user satisfaction. Second, in contrast to the first finding, attitudinal and control beliefs expose a low participation in household user satisfaction explanation. Third, the overall results state that belief structure is markedly different from those found in household technology intention and use.
