Active methodologies and digital technologies in learning : A systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
The advent of active learning methodologies and educational technologies allowed a major change in pedagogical practice, making conventional teaching processes increasingly decontextualized with the training demands of today's digital society. What is also perceived is the emergence of methods and digital technological resources that promote student-centered teaching and the teacher increasingly assuming the role of mediator of learning. In this perspective, the present work deals with a systematic review of the literature on the use of digital educational technologies and active methodologies in the context of basic education, essentially in classes from 6th to 9th grade. Our objective was to systematically, through parameter and guidelines Prisma Group, bring together a collection of published works, in bibliographic bases (Web of Science, Scopus and Scielo) on this topic in order to verify the potential of using digital technologies to support active methodologies for the student's learning process.
