Knowledge Management in Software Process Improvement: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
The development of software products and services within organizations generates a large amount of information that is not recorded and is generally known as tacit knowledge, that is the most valuable information for an organization, since knowledge helps to improve and avoid repetitions of errors. In this context, the implementation of Software Process Improvement within this type of organizations is increasingly important, due to the constant demand for quality in their products and services. However, many of these organizations lose this knowledge and it is not reflected in their software development processes. Therefore, this article establishes the current state of the techniques, tools and strategies for good knowledge management that allow the extraction of tacit knowledge, and its importance within the software processes improvement. The analysis carried out had made it possible to identify the importance of knowledge management and the case studies where knowledge management has been implemented in the software processes improvement. The analysis of the 16 primary studies has identified the importance of knowledge management showing that 15% of the selected primary studies propose a technique, another 15% a tool, while 23% propose a strategy equal to 20% a new domain, with this 27% present a case study.
