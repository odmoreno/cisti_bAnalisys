E-commerce experiences
ABSTRACT
The evolution of information and communication technologies, namely the Internet, has introduced new ways of buying and selling products and services, has provided the growth of market dimension, a larger transparency in negotiations, a bigger ease of access from companies to their target market, the permanent presence (24 hours a day, 7 days a week), and has imposed cost reductions, among other opportunities [1]. To electronic commerce are associated concerns related to the security of the information that floats on open channels such as the Internet [2]. The empirical part of this paper focuses on a case study about the electronic commerce experience of higher education students, in this case, the students of Instituto Polit√©cnico de Tomar.
