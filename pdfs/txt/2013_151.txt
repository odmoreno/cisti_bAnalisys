Integration of heterogeneous mobile devices in scenarios of enterprise training inside and outside â€” Mobility and cloud
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a proposal for the management, mentoring and training activities for employees of an organization. The training activities normally take place indoors; however, the nomadic life of some employees often makes difficult their training. Thus, the proposal takes into account the internal trainees and those who for various circumstances may not do so presentially. The use of heterogeneous mobile devices was further concerns the design proposal, since it is not always possible that all learners have the same type of platform, making it even more complicated if the organization allow BYOD. This proposal includes the development of two server applications, one located inside the organization and the other located in the cloud. The proposed solution will enable mobile interaction between the devices, the internal server and the server located in the cloud.
