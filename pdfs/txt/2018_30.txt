The QualIndique app for the collection of education quality indicators
ABSTRACT
In the current educational context, the assessment of the education quality is consolidated through the implementation of the Sistema de Avaliação da Educação Básica (Saeb) and the creation of the Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação (Ideb). However, there is still a need for the participation of the school community to generate information that allows a clearer vision of the local reality. The possibility of using mobile devices for participatory assessment is the focus of this article. The QualIndique application was developed for the iOS platform to enable the school community to participate in data collection using a mobile device. It is concluded that the use of mobile devices can make participatory assessment feasible because it minimizes the costs of printing questionnaires, sending them to INEP and digitizing the data, as well as allowing a greater participation of the school community.
