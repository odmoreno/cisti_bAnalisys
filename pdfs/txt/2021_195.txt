Agricultural Production and Environmental Pollution: Relationship between Agricultural Methane Gas Emissions, Agricultural Production and Exports of ICT Services in Latin America
ABSTRACT
The objective of this article is to estimate the environmental Kuznets Curve for a group of 17 countries belonging to Latin America, in the period 1970-2008, by specifying a panel data model, to show whether there really is a Curve Kuznets environmental in these countries. The main results show that the relationship between Agricultural Emissions of Methane Gas, Agricultural Production and Exports of ICT Services, can describe an inverted U-shaped curve, indicating that Agricultural Production and Exports of ICT Services play an important role in increasing the impacts of growth on environmental degradation.
