Feedback in Virtual Software Development Teams
ABSTRACT
Feedback is an important practice of software development. Effective feedback enables the continuous improvement of individuals and teams. In this paper, we conduct a multivocal literature review, including both academic and industrial/gray literature, aiming to investigate the adoption of feedback processes in virtual software development teams. By including different types of primary studies in this review, we aimed to get the perception of both practitioners and academics about the benefits and challenges related to the feedback process. As a contribution, we summarize a set of good practices to support each stage of the feedback process. Good practices may help feedback givers and receivers to increase the positive outcomes of feedback.
