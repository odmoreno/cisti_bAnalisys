Model based on system dynamics for the evaluation of construction industries technology transfer performance in Colombia
ABSTRACT
Considering that the strategies developed in Colombia to transfer knowledge and technology have not yet achieved the desired economic impact, evidenced in part in the country's competitiveness index and its position in the world innovation index, the present research work aims to formulate a model based on system dynamics for the analysis of the technology transfer process between the transfer agents and the material supplier industries of the construction sector in Colombia, allowing the analysis of their performance and proposing improvements to the process. For this purpose, variables that have been less studied are included, such as the role of university members, communication skills and, teamwork skills (between technology sender and receiver), thus expanding the state of the art of technology transfer.
