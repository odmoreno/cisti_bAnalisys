sBioWaste: Social Responsibility in the Biowaste Valuation
ABSTRACT
The polluter-pays principle implies that costs and waste management are concerned of the initial producer of that waste based on the social responsibility strategy. Thus, the objective of this article is to describe the process of creation of an intelligent system for the valorisation of biowaste. The methodology is subdivided into a theoretical analysis, through a literature review, in social responsibility, accountability, bio-waste, technology, communication, electronics and information systems. And in an experimental analysis, through the development of a prototype ecopoint for biowaste. The result shows an agile and intelligent solution to assess the biowaste, with reduced investment.
