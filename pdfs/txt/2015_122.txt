A gamified application for assessment of balance and fall prevention
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the development of a novel gamified application for fall prevention. The gaming system can help people in risk of falling, such as the senior population, assess their condition. A standard balance assessment test was select, which is termed the Berg Balance Scale. We have adapted it to the form of a digital game and thus enable the elderly to perform it at home, independently, and in a more friendly way. This game evaluates the body posture of the elderly through a wearable sensor that can analyze body motion through the acceleration and angle of the movements performed during the test. After playing through the game, the elderly is given a score in terms of his risk of falling. In the future, the game will be expanded to also recommend a set of exercises for the player to perform regularly in order to decrease the risk of falling.
