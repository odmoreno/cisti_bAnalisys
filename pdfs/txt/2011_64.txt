Data analysis of three procedures for constructing semiconductors: Mold, Solder Ball and Singulation
ABSTRACT
Semiconductor's production is a complex process that involves several sequential steps until obtaining the final product. Team and machine fault detection and performance analysis, in the manufacturing process, are essential to the success of a company in this field. This paper presents the results obtained by applying multivariate statistical methods to data on three processes of the production line of a semiconductor company: Molding, Solder Ball Attach and Singulation. From the analysis of the real data it can be concluded that there are statistical differences regarding the performance, concerning the time taken and number of faults, of the four teams that operate on the company analyzed.
