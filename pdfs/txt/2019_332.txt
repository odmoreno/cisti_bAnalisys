Key Determinants of Social Media Adoption in the B2B Context
ABSTRACT
The Internet and social media have gained increasing visibility in the business world. In the last decade, this digital transformation has led to a change in the behavior of marketers and managers around the world. It should be noted that, although there are still some fears arising from the use of social media in the B2B context, it is unquestionable that these have become essential in the design of a competitive strategy. The purpose of our study is to identify the main determinants of the adoption of social media in the B2B context. Based on a sample of 223 workers from B2B companies, the structural equations model was used to test the relationships among the variables learning, memorability, errors, usability, usefulness, social influence, satisfaction, trust, intention to use social media and adoption of social media. The results showed that all variables considered are fundamental in explaining the adoption of social media.
