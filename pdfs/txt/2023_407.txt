Rethinking the curricula in teaching accounting: The skills required by the market
ABSTRACT
Society is facing important transformations and challenges arising, in particular, from rapid technological evolution and the growing need for global development to be based on sustainable objectives. The Accounting profession is not indifferent to these transformations and challenges; therefore, it is necessary to reflect on the appropriate skills to the performance of the profession in this changing society, and, consequently, on the skills that the student must acquire and develop within the scope of the Accounting degree. In this sense, this work aims to identify the skills that a degree in Accounting should promote in students to respond to the current and future demands of the profession. For this, an exploratory study was carried out, having concluded that the Accounting profession is changing, with increasing importance being attributed to management support functions and decision-making (business partner). In addition, the results also point to the need to reinforce skills in the area of information and communication technologies and, also, in professional and personal skills.
