ABSTRACT
The incursion of digital platforms such as TikTok represents a rethinking of traditional communication processes, as well as the structure of the content presented. In response to these changes, educational dissemination in recent years integrates a conglomerate of strategies whose purpose is to democratize education and bring it closer to each individual; TikTok then emerges as the ideal platform to do so, due to the multiple resources it covers and the scope it implies in relation to the material that is broadcast. Therefore, this research aims to determine the communication practices of Tiktokers accounts from Ecuador and Peru dedicated to producing educational content: the topics they cover, the implicit narrative resources, and the reach of the posts they broadcast. The data collection for this descriptive-exploratory investigation uses a documentary analysis applied to the accounts selected for the investigation.
