Media convergence and online representation of president Bachelet's public account: @latercera and @thecliniccl during the presidential speech on 21 May
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to take the speech on 21 May as a milestone and analyze the treatment given by The Clinic and La Tercera journals on their Twitter accounts. The study seeks to elucidate which subjects are given greater importance and coverage in the accounts. Moreover, we try to establish which are the politicians, parties and coalitions with greater presence, and what are the approaches and valuations from which they are shown. This study aims to contribute to understand the dynamics of framing information by two media in digital platforms. The media accounts proposed for this analysis are @latercera and @thecliniccl, as they are two written press media that, being both among the 15 most influential accounts in Chile, present dissimilar editorial lines which makes their comparison and tracing even more interesting.
