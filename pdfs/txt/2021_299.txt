Approach to the treatment of the right to communication in academic publications on the Organic Law of Communication of Ecuador
ABSTRACT
The research is based on the recognition that the right to communication exists in the legislation of Ecuador with the intention of identifying the approach carried out from academic research, particularly in the case of the Organic Law of Communication (LOC). The period examined is from 2013 to 2020. The work advances the qualitative results of a long-term analysis on the incorporation and exercise of rights in the communication system of the Andean nation. The research questions are 1) What are the research topics and the authors referred to in the academic research on LOC? 2) Is there a guarantee or regulation approach in the academic studies of the LOC? The methodology is descriptive and relational, the techniques used are content analysis and semi-structured interviews. Based on the data of the most repeated words and expressions and the testimonies, it is concluded that a regulatory and sanctioning approach persists but not guarantees in the evidence that the researchers have explored.
