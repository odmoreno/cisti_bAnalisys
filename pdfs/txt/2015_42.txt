Adoption of ICT in the aging: Systematic review based on ICT for Alzheimer's disease and other senile dementias
ABSTRACT
A deep interest in Information Technology and Communication (ICT) in the elderly is often driven by growing and unsustainable costs of health services. The unprecedented growth of the older population in Mexico and around the world, forces us to confront - in an urgent way - the health care needs of the elderly by institutions, businesses, industry and government. In this paper we integrate the knowledge we have so far about the elderly with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the opportunities offered by ICTs to him/her and his/her primary caregiver.
