Rigor, order and shape. Livio Vacchini: Vacchini house in costa tenero (1991–92): Dynamics between construction and architecture
ABSTRACT
In Livio Vacchini´s works, the structural skeleton formalizes the architectural unity language, through its analytical rigor and an order that gives proportion and hierarchy to the piece. The architect needs the new systems and information tecnologies, to achieve the abstraction and rigor required to reach the universal object. Everything happens between his argumentative logic and his refined construction techniques.
