Internet of things Interoperability: A smart IoT gateway approach
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things can offer substantial economic benefits by implementing different services and applications focused on various aspects of our lives, but it also faces many critical technical challenges. In particular, in an environment where countless heterogeneous IoT devices of different types and technical profiles operate, developing the ability to communicate with each other and make them easily accessible is one of the main challenges in IoT. For this reason, IoT interoperability emerges as an essential need for developing and adopting this disruptive technology. In this sense, a smart IoT gateway architecture is defined in this work to enable technical and syntactic interoperability of heterogeneous devices and integration with standard IoT platforms.
