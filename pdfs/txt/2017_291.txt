IT service management using ITIL v3: A case study
ABSTRACT
The organizations adopt best practices that guarantee the quality of their services agreed with their clients. Universities are not unrelated to this need, because they need to have processes that facilitate the service management. This article presents an experience of the adoption of ITIL best practices in the Service Desk area for the management of incidents and requirements through a Web system (GLPI). The area has processes that facilitate the management of services, however it is not aligned with an IT services management framework that allows them to offer a quality service to their users. It is proposed to improve these processes and to implement new processes necessary to increase the level of perceived quality, applying the ITIL framework. The results show greater user satisfaction.
