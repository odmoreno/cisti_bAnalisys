The educational potential of mobile technologies for young high school graduates: a situated approach
ABSTRACT
This article aims to identify strategies and creative improvisations in the use of mobile technologies. We adopt a qualitative research approach and the postmodern paradigm of Anthropological Design. We used the techniques of reenacting and narrative interviews with young Brazilians, who finished high school and did not enter higher education. The results showed that, in addition to entertainment and communication, mobile technological devices are used to access information and solve everyday problems, constituting skills and competencies that connect to elements surrounding the subject.
