Deployment and Automatic Registration of REST APIs using Jenkins, Spring Boot and WSO2 API Manager
ABSTRACT
The API Gateway is a fundamental component within a large-scale microservices architecture, as it centralizes all the applications consumed by the different clients in a single access point. This is responsible for managing and administering security as a policy enforcement point, as well as the API lifecycle. The basic function of the API Gateway is to intercept all incoming requests that are sent through the API management system. Managing APIs in large systems requires a lot of effort to maintain the API lifecycle. To address this issue, we created a project that automatically manages the registration and deployment of APIs, using the starter provided by the Spring Boot framework, which is normally used to solve dependency management, WSO2 API Gateway and Jenkins as a tool for automating deployment tasks. The testing and validation process of the API lifecycle management solution scheme was performed in a controlled environment with virtual machines and docker container for the API Gateway.
