Hypodermic Tubing used in the Positive Pressure Flow Generator for a CPAP Device
ABSTRACT
The procurement of medical equipment for respiratory therapy is limited for hospitals with limited resources. Therefore, this document describes the procedure for shaping the tip of a hypodermic tube. This includes the design, manufacture, and adaptation of this essential internal element of a UCL VENTURA CPAP ventilator. SolidWorks software is used for the design, while ANSYS software is used for the simulation. An analysis of the machine's infrastructure is performed to determine that there is no overstress and unexpected failures are generated. Likewise, an impact analysis is performed in a specific contact region, between the tip and the tube, to determine its deformation. Finally, the machine is built and laboratory tests are performed. The results show 1.31 mm (average value) of deformation of the hypodermic tube, which adapts to the developed simulations, corroborating the correct operation of the mechanism.
