Enhancing Banking Operations with Microservices and Mobile Technology
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a novel architecture for enhancing the banking experience by combining microservices and a mobile application. The use of microservices provides scalability and flexibility in the development process, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones. The results of the study shows that the proposed architecture is capable of handling high volume of transactions and requests while providing high quality of service. The mobile application provides a user-friendly interface for accessing financial information, and the use of microservices ensures efficient management of data and transactions. The architecture also has the potential to improve security through the use of security measures to protect sensitive data. As a future research direction, the proposed architecture can be evaluated in real-world settings and its security can be further tested. The field of technology in the banking sector is constantly evolving, and it is important to stay updated with new advancements that can potentially improve the proposed architecture.
