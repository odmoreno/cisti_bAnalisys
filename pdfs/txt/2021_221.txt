Virtual Reality for enhanced learning in artistic disciplines of degree of video games
ABSTRACT
This work is based on the hypothesis that implementation of virtual reality (VR) technology in the classroom helps to improve student's academic performance. The proposal involves new teaching methodologies that incorporate VR and gamification techniques in video games projects development. The methodological implementation takes place in the subjects of Modern Art, and Sound and Virtual Reality of Video Games degree. Both subjects are based in artistic content, so the study focuses on the contribution that technology provides as a medium for the development of video game content. Variables such as Difficulty, degree of satisfaction or usefulness (utility) from student's responses to questionnaires are evaluated. Results show high correlations between variables and explain in a way the latent variable, motivation. This research approach will initially be implemented in the academic courses of the School of New Interactive Technologies of the University of Barcelona.
