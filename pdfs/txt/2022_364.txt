Monitoring the evolution of Gender Equality Index in Europe: dashboard proposal
ABSTRACT
This article presents relevant information and a new vision on the theme "Gender Equality", based on public data. The main focus is to analyze data from the General Index of Gender Equality, available in EIGEâ€™s portal. The analysis was based on the domain and subdomain scores of EU countries, in the six domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Dashboards were created from the data collected from EIGE, and the history of the evolution of the Index was presented: first, from the analysis of the General Index to the scores of the domains and finally subdomains and how they reflect the reality experienced in EU countries and with emphasis in Portugal. The ETL methodology and Business Analytics techniques and tools were applied, thus obtaining the dashboards that revealed conclusive data about the progress of Gender Equality (2013-2021). It was intended to present another visualization to complement traditional infographics available on EIGE. It was considered that this study is relevant, as it is a topic that is debated today and that needs attention from users and researchers.
