Description of a public administration case on the management of IS service suppliers
ABSTRACT
The lack of scientific contributions on outsourcing of IT services at public administration makes interesting the description of real cases. Thus, we describe here the strategy of prequalification of suppliers for information systems and information technology services at the Generalitat de Catalunya. We consider relevant this strategy given its novelty within the public sector and its representativeness on its context. This description is based on the information retrieved so far in our research. In order to contrast its utility, we also analyze this strategy in comparison to an existing conceptual schema on this same domain.
