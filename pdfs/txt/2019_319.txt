Essays on the Post-Artificial Intelligence Society
ABSTRACT
The present study identifies the potential effects of Artificial Intelligence in organizations, in the future of work and of the labor market, as well as its effects on lifestyle, livingconditions and society. Towards answering our research questions of an exploratory nature, focusing on the prospects for the future rather than on the present reality, we interviewed a set of experts who reconcile a good understanding of new emerging technologies of Artificial Intelligence with a good knowledge of organizational, social and market dynamics. The interviewees' responses were compared with a set of assumptions based on the revised literature. Thus, the semi-structured questions and their analysis naturally involve qualitative data, since the prospective nature of the present study does not allow the collection and subsequent processing of quantitative data with the necessary scope. From the results and analysis thereof, it is concluded that, regardless of the diversity existing among the respondents in terms of generational and academic training, the answers converge on the expectations of increases in efficacy, quality of service, in productivity and efficiency, and reductions on the number of employees in organizations resulting from automation. In addition, they mentioned the possible disappearance of functions and even functional areas, as well as the automation of many functions and the emergence of more qualified job opportunities.
