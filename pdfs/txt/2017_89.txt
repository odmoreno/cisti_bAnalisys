RODA-in: A generic tool for the mass creation of submission information packages
ABSTRACT
RODA-in is an offline tool designed to easily create thousands of SIPs with gigabytes of data in an easy to use way. This is possible by using aggregation rules, which map files and folders to SIPs, and metadata association rules, which add metadata to the created SIPs. The basic workflow can be defined in a sequence of easy steps where the user starts by selecting the folders to be archived and then chooses which patterns will be used to transform the data in SIPs. As an optional step, it's possible to edit the generated SIPs to either enrich them or fix exceptions to the rule. Lastly, it's possible to export to two different formats: BagIt and E-ARK SIP. In this paper we present and discuss all the decisions and ideas taken to implement RODA-in like which workflow should be used, what aggregation and metadata association options are currently implemented, how the metadata templating system works and which other features can be used to enrich the SIPs.
