DinofelisAR demo augmented reality based on natural features
ABSTRACT
Augmented reality has seen a fast-growing gain of interest in the last few decades. Due to technological advances, smartphones are now devices that allow to experience augmented reality systems, anytime and anywhere. Although its emerging success among users, some problems AR have been reported inhibiting its full acceptance in our digital society. The aim of this paper is to present a study about techniques to implement augmented reality systems in the cultural heritage context, including a prototype to test the technology which, based on physical objects that belong to the landscape, present an effective and accurate augmented reality approach, overlaying 3D virtual models aligned over the real images, using a smartphone's camera.
