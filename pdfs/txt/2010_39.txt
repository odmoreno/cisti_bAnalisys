Categorization of user behaviour: Digital imaging architectural visualization in immersive media
ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on empirically characterize the emotional behavior of users in the digital image display according to the medium in which is performed and depending on the type of image, user's sex and type of screen. The basis of the study aims to improve and adapt the features of a visual message that generates an optimized impact on the user, taking into account the variables described above. To achieve the basic objectives, we have approached the job from a multidisciplinary perspective, using the theoretical background in the field of psychology for measuring the user's emotional response, implementing them in techniques of usability and human interaction with the interface (HCI-HCC) to evaluate the technical characteristics of digital image and different environments of visualization in the fields of ICT.
