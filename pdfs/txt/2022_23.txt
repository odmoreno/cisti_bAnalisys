Optimization of the quality of emergency care through multidisciplinary databases
ABSTRACT
At present, one of the most important techniques for improving the quality of patient care is the exhaustive analysis of all aspects of such care through the use of specific and detailed databases. A database capable of integrating and relating all the aspects that directly and indirectly affect the assistance or emergencies carried out in the province of Ja√©n (Jaen city, Andalusian, Spain), over a period of eight years, has been created. For this purpose, health, social, economic, environmental and geographical information has been stored and related to each assistance. The high level of interrelation that exists between all the variables involved in patient care has been used to analyse and predict the number and type of care that will appear in the future, as well as to efficiently manage all the resources involved in such care.
