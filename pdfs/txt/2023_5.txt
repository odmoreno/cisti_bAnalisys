The Big Brother Experience: opportunities of a video surveillance system in Amadora city
ABSTRACT
When in 1949 George Orwell wrote the book “1984”, no one could predict its future impact. In his dystopian novel, Orwell described a totalitarian society strongly marked by vigilance and all the consequences that come from it. Although a society with these characteristics might have seemed far away or completely out of the realm of possibility until relatively recently, the truth is, that the latest technological advances have raised pertinent issues related to security and privacy, but also freedom of individuals. This technology has created surveillance devices that are beginning to be implemented around the world with the aim of combating crime. But to what extent are these video surveillance systems an effective tool in combating crime and how does the population react and how do they feel about this control?
