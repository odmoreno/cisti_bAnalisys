Algebra teaching: An inclusive experience from the information technologies and communications
ABSTRACT
The organizations and institutions, national and international, promote the defense of the rights of populations with disabilities, similarly emit policies, programs, or projects aimed at solving the needs of such sectors. In the field of education, in spite of the efforts made to include people with disabilities, the indices of exclusion and inequity persist that make possible quality and equality teaching and learning processes. However, as evidenced by the lack of assistance and attention for the realization of an inclusive education, particularly for the population with hearing disabilities, we can also mention the growing interest in developing projects based on technologies that facilitate the development of skills and improve the processes inside the classroom. Taking into account the above, this article shows a research project that consisted of the design and implementation of a virtual classroom of inclusive learning aimed at students with hearing disabilities. The results obtained show the importance of technological tools in the teaching processes of non-inclusive populations, by improving processes of interpretation analysis in a secondary course in the area of mathematics of a school in the City of Bogot√°, Colombia.
