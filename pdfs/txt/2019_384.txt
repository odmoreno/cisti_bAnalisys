The Generation of Experiences as a Differentiating Strategic Factor in the Design of Products: An Approach from Neuromarketing
ABSTRACT
The current market environment is extremely competitive. In recent years, the increase in competition and competitiveness among companies has grown exponentially increasing the variety of products in the market, so the development of business strategies to ensure their long-term survival is increasingly complicated. In addition, the changes produced in consumer purchasing behavior, promote the creation of new business models that continue to attract and motivate customers as well as a new concept of marketing adapted to this situation, capable of establishing new communication channels. Traditional marketing, conventional advertising and reduced price strategies, lose effectiveness in a new era in which the consumer acquires power and prominence, so in addition to the improvement and evolution of the characteristics of the products, it must be provided attention to the customer experience, since the potential lies in conquering the emotions of consumers. Neuromarketing offers state-of-the-art techniques to test minds based on information resident in the brain and their preferences. In this way, it is possible to predict the behavior of consumers more effectively than with traditional market research techniques, providing a competitive advantage for companies in order to satisfy the emotional needs of their customers, by providing unique experiences of consumption with the purpose of persuading them in the decision making and fidelizing them in the future.
