Visual analytical model for educational data
ABSTRACT
Current technologies used in learning processes imply the logging of all the performed activities. These data can be exploited to gain insight into the learning process and can be used for the assessment of students, professors and the processes themselves. However, although this wealth of data exists, it is still difficult for the teachers (and interested stakeholders) to verify hypothesis, extract conclusions, or make decisions based on discovered facts or situations. This paper introduces an educational data analysis model based on visual analytics, learning analytics and academic analytics, by means of a software tool that allows performing confirmatory and exploratory data analysis through the interacting with the gathered information from a typical Learning Management System. The main goal thus is to define a model which enable the discovery of knowledge on the specific learning process that, in turn, will permit to improve it.
