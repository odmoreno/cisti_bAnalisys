Toward a Model based on Gamification to Influence the Productivity of Software Development Teams
ABSTRACT
Software development is characterized by being an activity centered on people. From this perspective, it is common that there are issues related to the development team and their need for communication, collaboration, motivation, commitment, among others. These issues are also presented in the management of software projects, which are not only oriented towards the technical part but towards social and human factors. For this reason, software companies are interested to provide solutions to this kind of difficulties that influence the productivity of the team, the satisfaction of their customers, the costs, the quality, and the time of their projects. In order to contribute with this purpose, we propose a model based on gamification to intervene social and human factors and influence the productivity of development team. Through gamification, we seek to develop skills and abilities related to social and human factors in such a way that team is motivated, committed, satisfied, and its work is reflected in the results of the projects.
