Urbis: A touristic virtual guide
ABSTRACT
Currently, we realize that in general tourists spend a lot of time planning their trips because they need to make the most of every moment. In this sense, technology has been a great ally, especially to make this planning as well as to adapt in the event of some unforeseen during the journey. In the last decade, an increasing trend was observed, the traveler or tourist is always connected to mobile devices. The emergence of different types of mobile devices was presented as an opportunity to significantly improve the tourist life in relation to the planning of the trip. In this context, this research aims to identify the main computing needs to support the improvement of tourist point of promotion for the traveler, by the means of a mobile application proposal. To accomplish this, we have adopted a literature review as the research methodology. The main result of this paper is the proposal of the Urbis prototype, an application that aims to help tourists to know better the cities they're visiting, even in the absence of local information or a specialized tour guide.
