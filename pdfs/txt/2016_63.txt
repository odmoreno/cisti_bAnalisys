Although the calendar tends to have a personal connotation, there are many families who use it as the best way to manage their activities and organize family time, sharing by all the same calendar. Reconcile all events in one place shared without privacy commitment of each one, it becomes a difficult task. One option is to use a second calendar that puts the events that should not be shared within the family. However, this solution becomes slow for all events consultation. Thus, the proposed solution is the creation of a calendar, with three types of data display, to ensure that one can use it without compromising the privacy of each element. A web platform with a calendar and tasks to support these three types of exhibition was created and tested by families in their day to day over a period of time. The responses allowed to conclude that a calendar is a great memory aid as more than 80% use it to this end. The results obtained showed the needs that a user has when using a calendar as well as the willingness to use it in the family.
