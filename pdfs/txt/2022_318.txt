A study in Special needs Institutions in some Latin-American countries during COVID-19 outbreak
ABSTRACT
Currently, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, many institutions have been subject to an unpredicted change, because, they were forced to move from an in-person education to an online and emergency education. There are many studies about teachers’ and students’ perceptions with the experienced online setting during the lockdown. However, there is a lack of studies about how Institutions with special needs people have handled this complicated situation, and how people from this important sector of education have had more problems in the adaptation to this new online and emergency education. This paper describes the results of some Latin-American countries study and reflects on factors that need to be improved to increase the quality of emergency education on special needs institutions.
