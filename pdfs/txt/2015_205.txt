Applicability of knowledge management practices at scientific research environment
ABSTRACT
The Knowledge Management (KM) is becoming a valuable strategic resource for the life of individuals and companies, and has been identified by scholars, researchers and scientists as relevant and required for the growth of organizations in various fields. This paper presents the results of a survey research with exploratory which seeks to identify what KM practices adopted by researchers in the research environment and to understand to what extent are contributing to scientific production. The results indicate that several KM practices are adopted in the research environment. However, it is observed that these are personal initiatives by researchers, without any coordination or management with specific purpose. This scenario shows that there must be a greater awareness of the importance of KM in the research environment. In this sense, an organizational culture should be noted that values knowledge not only as an essential device to researchers, but as a fundamental resource to research environments able to boost the production of scientific knowledge.
