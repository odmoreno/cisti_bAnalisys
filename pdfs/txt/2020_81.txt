Digital Content Curation for Distance Education : Quality, updating and teaching skills
ABSTRACT
Curating digital content in distance learning has become a reality in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Brazil. The growth of this education modality, especially in 2019, make that for the first time in the country, the number of students was greater than in the present modality. This turns almost a requirement, the need to understand how it works and what the challenges of digital content curation are. This article aims to present the results of the application of an exploratory questionnaire conducted with five stakeholders who are or should be part of the digital content curation process, totaling a sample of 28 respondents from different regions of Brazil. The results show that there is still lack of knowledge about the applicability of the concept of digital curation in education and a constant concern about the quality requirements, updating and teaching skills necessary for curating activity. These results reinforce the importance of the creation of a digital curation quality reference model for Higher Education, which is part of an ongoing PhD research that used the results of the exploratory questionnaire to create data collection instruments with greater depth.
