The role of corporate communication in innovation laboratories of Peruvian companies
ABSTRACT
This study determines the role of corporate communication in the innovation laboratories of Peruvian companies that are part of a conglomerate. A qualitative research was carried out through six interviews in order to identify the relevance and functionality of communication in all phases of implementation and growth of innovation laboratories and to determine the role that corporate communication plays in these laboratories vis-Ã -vis the corporation to which they belong. Although until now there have been no studies on the role of corporate communication in innovation laboratories in Peru; the leaders of innovation laboratories recognize the importance of communication, although its role is incipient in the laboratories considered in this study.
