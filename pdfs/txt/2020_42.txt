Personality Types as Categorical Moderator of the Acceptance of IT: A Multi-Group Analysis in BrazilÂ´s Banking
ABSTRACT
This study aims to examine the influence of personality types on the intention of using and accepting information technologies in Brazil's banking system. Based on the model of the five dominant personality traits and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 271 users were examined. Findings indicate that personality type plays an essential role as a categorical moderator at the IT acceptance, beyond the mere consideration of personality traits. This can help Brazilian banks to implement the technology successfully in future work, contributing to increasing financial success by attracting new customers and improving the quality of satisfaction in their services.
