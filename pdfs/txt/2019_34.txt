Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Predict the Performance of Contact Centers Operators
ABSTRACT
A problem faced by contact centers is observing the absenteeism and productivity of the operators for decision making. For companies that rely heavily on human resources, machine learning permits the use of tools for predicting the performance of their professionals. This academic project focuses on using machine learning and data science technologies to predict the performance for employees of a large company with contact centers in Brazil. Eight prediction models were selected for adjustment and testing with 208 variables from population exceeds 15 thousand employees. These data will be extracted from the operators' profile and then filtered through correlation and variable selection processes. The selected features will be used to compare the prediction of absenteeism and productivity by the different algorithms of classification and regression (cf. RF - Random Forest, MLP - Support Vector Machine, NB - Naive Bayes, XGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting, DMM - Dummy and LSTM - Long Short Term Memory). The hyper parameterization of these ML models is also considered to evaluate which one would be the most suitable for the prediction problem.
