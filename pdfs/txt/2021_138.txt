Playing with Escape Room Games for Children : An online experience at home in times of pandemic
ABSTRACT
The research shows how, in the Covid-19 pandemic, Escape Room games can be used with a child to develop perception, logical thinking and cooperative work. Guidance on BNCC skills and gamification elements were used to evaluate the applications of games in a case study. Eight digital games with children's themes were used in apps or online and later a physical Escape was built at the residence, based on the experience with the digital games. It is concluded that adult-child collaboration is essential to develop BNCC skills and that new physical versions of play can be richer, with new themes and components.
