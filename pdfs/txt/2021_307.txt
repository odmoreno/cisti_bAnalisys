Does this brand represent me? A look at the female stereotypes in advertising
ABSTRACT
The aim of this research was to analyze what gender stereotypes are perceived by women aged 20-24 years in the "Friendship without differences" campaign of the Peruvian beer Pilsen Callao and their attitude towards the brand on Facebook. A qualitative approach was selected as the research method for this study, where 14 women undergraduate students were interviewed. It was shown that students recognize the use of gender stereotypes in advertising to unfavorably describe women as sexual objects or in roles related to housework and childcare, and little use of representations of them in professional roles, friendship and gender equality, which they consider relevant to feel more identified.
