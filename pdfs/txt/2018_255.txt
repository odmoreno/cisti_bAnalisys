Using wolfram software to improve reading comprehension in mathematics for software engineering students
ABSTRACT
The higher education through virtual environment is students centered oriented to the interactive learning, in situations to be closer to the real world; for that reason, teachers must have new communicative competence. students centered oriented to the interactive learning, in situations to be closer to the real world. This paper shows the use of Wolfram software as a supplementary educational resource in the process of reading comprehension in mathematics, in the first, and third semester of Information and Computer System Engineering as part of process of formation of future engineering. Mathematics is a fundamental subject in the normative process of educating the future professionals. For example, this can be applied by using the technology, and software by Wolfram. Students from experimental groups used together with the teacher the software Wolfram Mathematica. The experience in this research by teacher shows the necessity of include this math package as supplementary educational resource, which support the capacity of calculus, and interpretation of the non-trivial problems.
