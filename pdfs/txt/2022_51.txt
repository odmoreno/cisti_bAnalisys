Monitoring Cities’ Environmental Sustainability : Lisbon’s Case Study
ABSTRACT
In a world of increasing urbanization and where climate change is a growing concern, data presents itself as way to measure the established efforts and forecast future needs and policies as Lisbon finds means to solve some of the major problems that come with being a large city such as air quality and pollution, waste management, mobility, and overall quality of life for its residents. As such, this project developed a dashboard in a BI visualization tool comprised of metrics and indicators based on a tailored framework from the city derived from pre-existing frameworks and conversations with Lisbon’s city experts. The result is a prototypical dashboard that can be built upon in the future, once the city invests in a stronger ICT infrastructure that allows for the collection of data to support a project of this nature, something that, currently, is lacking.
