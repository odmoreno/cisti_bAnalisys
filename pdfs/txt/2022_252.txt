A Proposed Disruptive Education Management Platform
ABSTRACT
Given the importance of e-learning to the process of teaching and learning contemporary, precisely, in higher education, and distance learning opportunities offered by the use of these platforms, we undertook in this article an empirical-descriptive research to know the extent of this problematic, guided by a literature review and case study as scientific methods. Here, we present concepts, historical perspectives, methodologies, characteristics and resources of learning platforms, and their evolution into personal learning environments. A survey took place from January to December 2021.
