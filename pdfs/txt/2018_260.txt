Public participation geographic information systems and collaborative mapping of social disorders in Brazil
ABSTRACT
The collaborative mapping of social disorders, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), has been a featured topic of study in the area of public safety. This approach is viable since the manifestation of social disorders as distinct phenomena can be related to particular crimes. Thus, with the mapping of social disorders, it is possible to analyze these phenomena, endeavor to understand their dynamics and promote preventative initiatives to combat them. The purpose of this study is to identify which methods and free software cited in the literature are the most highly recommended to carry out collaborative mapping of social disorders with GIS. With this research, it is clear that the use of GIS and mobile devices, aligned to collaborative systems, is a current trend in carrying out collaborative mapping of crimes and disorders.
