Software engineering â€” Software development for E, V, M learning with a high degree of usability for users with various disabilities
ABSTRACT
This doctoral thesis is about the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education or E-Teaching. It is based on the component-based software engineering (CBSE) [1] [2] to search available software to build a learning platform called Educational Immersive Portal (EIP) composed of a Content Management Software (CMS), a virtual classroom or Learning Management Software (LMS), a server and viewer Virtual Worlds (VW), communication libraries from CMS and MV to the LMS, between LMS and mobile phones and uses best practices in usability for people with various disabilities. One goal of the study is to determine the requirements generated by the application of learning strategies Blended Learning (BL) and Peer Instruction (PI) studying how the immersivity a MV offers participants, it can be exploited in the environment activities (also designed on this work) to improve the teaching of topics related to computer engineering. For this purpose, it has given importance to meet the system requirements and functional users of the platform, educational institutions, teachers and students referred to the application of BL and PI in PEI.
