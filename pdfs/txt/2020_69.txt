Technological Architecture with Low Cost Sensors to Improve Physical Therapy Monitoring
ABSTRACT
In this article, we propose a wireless monitoring solution for gait parameters using low-cost sensors in the physical rehabilitation of patients with gait disorders. This solution consists of infrared speed sensors (IRSS), force-sensing Resistor (FSR) and microcontrollers placed in a walker. These sensors collect the pressure distribution on the walker's handle and the speed of the steps during therapy session. The proposal allows to improve the traditional physiotherapy session times through a mobile application to perform the monitoring controlled by a health specialist in real time. The proposed solution consists of 4 stages: 1. Obtaining gear parameters, 2. Data transmission, 3. Information Storage and 4. Data collection and processing. Solution was tested with 10 patients from a physical rehabilitation center in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results revealed a significant reduction in the rehabilitation session from 25 to 5.2 minutes.
