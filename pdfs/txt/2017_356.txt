Webradio in the state universities: An analysis of the Andean community of nations
ABSTRACT
The University radio, as well as the radio media itself, has suffered many transformations at being adapted to new trends in the digital society. This mean of communication has been conceived as a laboratory for training professionals to express their creativity and to develop innovative content. This study aims to analyze the situation of the webradios of the State Universities of the countries members of the Andean Community of Nations (CAN) in order to quantify the implementation of this means of communication and to determine if the use of new information and communication technologies responds to the basic parameters of digital communication, and also to determine the countries which have made more progress in the digitization of this mean of communication.
