Cyberactivism, Facebook self-efficacy and collective action among peruvian students
ABSTRACT
The relationship between cyberactivism and collective action has been widely studied. However, there is questioning on how online activism can lead to offline initiatives. The present study proposes that the relationship between cyberactivism and offline collective action is mediated by Facebook self-efficacy to produce collective action. The sample was comprised of 293 undergraduate students (M = 19.93, SD = 1.73, women = 63.8%) from two private universities in Lima - Peru. Results showed that cyberactivism was related with Facebook self-efficacy (r = .29, p < .001) and offline collective action (r = .37, p < .001), while Facebook self-efficacy was also associated with offline collective action (r = .59 p < .001). Furthermore, the findings displayed a partial mediation of Facebook self-efficacy between cyberactivism and offline collective action (B = .19, SE = 0.5, 95%, CI [.11, .29]). The model accounted for (R2) 14% of the explained variance in collective action. Finally, results demonstrated a good adjusted model fit index (CFI = 1.00, SRMR = 0.00). The interplay between the variables can partially be explained through the concept of triadic reciprocal causation of the Social Cognitive Theory
