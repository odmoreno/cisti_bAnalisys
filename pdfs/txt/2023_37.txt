Text mining supporting initial literature review : When you start a new area of R&D – text mining may help you with this task
ABSTRACT
During a master’s or Ph.D. Thesis, starting a new project or research and development area (R&D), each investigator must get into the subject and scope of interest. For such knowledge, you must perform a literature review and explore what has been published in the area. There are several methodologies, some more scientific as systematic review, and others. Some have a defined protocol but mainly depend on the authors’ analysis. This research includes several database searches to retrieve text to analyze using text mining, to help on the initial step of review – identify keywords. When you are just starting a new R&D and you need to know the buzzwords for further and deeper investigation you can use text mining to help you. This work is a starting point to perform a state-of-the-art in health literacy area. Further than “Health literacy”, the top ten words are “University” and “School” beyond “Medicine”, “Patients”, care and “information”.
