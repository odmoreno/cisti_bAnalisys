Systematic mapping study to identify trends in the application of smart technologies
ABSTRACT
Smart Technologies include hardware, software and communications systems that are capable of automatically adapting and modifying their behavior (parameters) generating information and knowledge to support decision making. This paper focuses on identifying trends in the subject of intelligent technologies, through systematic mapping to answer questions about the fields, research areas and types of intelligent technologies present in the literature. The mapping study was conducted using a review protocol and analyzing 367 scientific database records, using specialized bibliometric analysis software. The results can help to understand the prevailing needs and trends, identifying points that still require further research, since important aspects related to particular points such as the conceptual development of this topic and the emerging areas in the application of the same are important given the increase in publications and relevance of this topic in recent years.
