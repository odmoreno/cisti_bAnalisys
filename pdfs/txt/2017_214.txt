Proposal for a methodology for the adoption of the big data
ABSTRACT
The increasing amount of data generated every second of time and available from multiple sources and in various formats has generated new ways of dealing with them: Big Data. Methodologies and technologies have been developed to make good use of these data, but their adoption by organizations is complex in many respects. A review of the state of the art shows several models and frameworks where solutions are proposed to some of these aspects, in a punctual but not integral form. Therefore, it is proposed a methodology for the adoption of Big Data and a model of maturity for it.
