Web 2.0 and blended learning: Potential and challenges in teacher education
ABSTRACT
The information society has placed new challenges to the teaching/learning process, modifying the construction of knowledge: the information access has become more dynamic requiring constant updating of knowledge. This paper describes a training course held in Azores for teachers of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education on Web 2.0 tools. This training was held in the blended learning mode with Moodle as the platform support. The produced contents and the adopted methodologies were evaluated in order to, more effectively, apply these resources in the teaching/learning context. This paper presents a set of rules to be adopted in the design and implementation of training courses in the blended learning mode and some guidelines to improve online learning environment usability.
