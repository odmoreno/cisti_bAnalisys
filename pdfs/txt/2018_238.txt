Towards a context-based framework for the software requirements elicitation process management
ABSTRACT
Software requirements elicitation is a process affected by various contextual factors such as the domain of the problem, the nature of the stakeholders and the requirements engineers themselves, among others. This work proposes a framework to model the elicitation process through two complementary approaches based on contextual factors that affect the elicitation. One of them intends to predict the course of a session by estimating if certain important objectives will be met for the development team. The other seeks to achieve a representation of the progression in time of the status of requirements considering the information that is captured during the sessions and how it becomes requirements. This proposal aims to be a practical tool for requirements engineers, whether they are new or experienced, in the management of these contextual factors and the management of the elicitation process.
