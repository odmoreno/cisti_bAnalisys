Performance evaluation of an Asterisk PBX prototype Beaglebone Black based
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the performance evaluation of an Asterisk IP telephone exchange, implemented on a low-cost development board called Beaglebone Black. To do that, first we implement the telephone exchange, followed by experimentally evaluating the prototype with the help of a SIP traffic generator, by obtaining the maximum number of simultaneous calls that the exchange supports, an analysis of the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics were performed with the help of Wireshark traffic analyzer. Finally, the evaluation was carried out under the MOS criteria, in order to qualify the Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics experimented by users. We identified the maximum value of simultaneous calls that was obtained with the SIPP traffic generator were 45 calls and in the real-time evaluation, 10 simultaneous calls were achieved with a MOS rating between Good and Excellent in 90% of the participants.
