Prediction of bank frauds by SMS or voice, from cell phone data analysis: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
In recent years there has been a marked increase in bank fraud by SMS (Short Messaging System) and voice. One of the factors contributing to increase in cases of SMS fraud is the low cost of acquiring large volumes of messages, the reliability (the message will reach the recipient) and the fact that it does not need the Internet to reach the victim. In relation to financial fraud by voice, these can be used to persuade victims to make bank transfers to fraudulent accounts, with the promise of receiving large sums in prizes. The prevention of these types of fraud is not a trivial task, as it requires the application of appropriate techniques and methods depending on their nature. This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) from 2015 to 2020, with the aim of analyzing the state of the art on bank frauds committed by SMS or voice. The SLR allowed the identification of the most common types of bank fraud by SMS or voice, and the respective detection techniques.
