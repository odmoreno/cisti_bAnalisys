The Behavior Driven Development Applied to the Software Quality Test:
ABSTRACT
The mechanisms of private investment in Brazilian sport are one of the main sources of resources that athletes hold to promote participation in high-performance competitions. In order to improve this flow, softwares are designed to shorten the path between donors and recipients. These tools, such as “Meu Campeãu” used in this paper, require efficient analysis of the quality of the product offered. Concepts known as agile methodologies have brought a new style to the analysis of the software developed, and one of them has gained considerable prominence, known such as BDD (Behavior Driven Development), so this paper aims to analyze the implementation of Behavior Driven Development in the software quality verification process “Meu Campeãu”.
