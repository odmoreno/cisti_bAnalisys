Automating the analysis and evaluation of occupational risk factors accumulated in the flower industry
ABSTRACT
One of the biggest responsibilities of a company doctor is recommending of a specialized manner the rational distribution of workers and employees as jobs related to the physiological ability of the personnel required. In Ecuador, this activity is performed even empirically, through the application of the Pre - Occupational Health Record, in which a thorough physical examination is performed and the pathologic labor history is collected; because despite having legislation setting to perform laboratory tests to complete the study, these are generally not held for lack of funds to pay them by the employer. The computer tool developed helps to the medical professional of floriculture companies in the analysis and evaluation of the accumulated occupational risk factors, thereby minimizing, errors that can occur in assigning a worker to a specific work activity and the probability that for that reason, the worker develops an occupational disease. The implementation of the application is done through algorithms and mathematical - clinical calculations of the elements that affecting in the accumulation of occupational hazards, based on the opinion of experts in occupational health, because there is no scientific evidence about procedures and technical tools to calculate the accumulative occupational risk. The validation performed determined that the tool is effective, because it has a sensibility of 76.19 % and a specificity of 99.28 %, and the tool has a high security having a positive predictive value of 94.11 % and a negative predictive value of 96,50%.
