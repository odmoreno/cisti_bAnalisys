Time/space based biometric handwritten signature verification
ABSTRACT
Handwritten signature recognition is still the most widely accepted method to validate paper based documents. However, in the digital world, there is no readymade way to distinguish a real handwritten signature on a scanned document from a forged copy of another signature made by the same person on another document that is simply “pasted” into the forged document. In this paper we describe how we are using the touch screen of smartphones or tablets to collect handwritten signature images and associated biometric markers derived from the motion direction of handwritten signatures that are made directly into the device touchscreen. These time base biometric markers can then be converted into signaling time waves, by using the dragging or lifting movements the user makes with a touch screen omnidirectional tip stylus, when he handwrites is signature at the device touchscreen. These time/space signaling time waves can then be converted into a biometric bit stream that can be matched with previously enrolled biometric markers of the user's handwritten signature. In this paper we contend that the collection of these simple biometric features is sufficient to achieve a level of user recognition and authentication that is sufficient for the majority of online user authentication and digital documents authenticity.
