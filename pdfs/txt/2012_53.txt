Linked Data methodologies for managing information about television content: Applying Linked Data principles in the OntoTV system, in order to improve the collection processes and the way television information is accessed
ABSTRACT
OntoTV is a television information management system designed for improving the quality and quantity of the formation available in the current television platforms. In order to achieve this objective, OntoTV (1) collects the information offered by the broadcasters, (2) integrates it into a ontology-based data structure, (3) extracts extra data from alternative television sources, and (4) makes possible for the user to perform queries over the stored information. This document shows the way Linked Data methodologies have been applied in OntoTV system, and the improvements in the data consumption and publication processes that have been obtained as result. By the one hand, the possibility of accessing to information available in the Web of Data has made possible to offer more complete descriptions about the programs, as well as more detailed guides than those obtained by using classic collection methods. On the other hand, as the information of the television programs and channels are published according to the Linked Data philosophy, it becomes available not only for OntoTV clients, but also for other agents able to access Linked Data resources, who could offer the viewer more fresh and innovative features.
