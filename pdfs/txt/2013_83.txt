A conceptualization of e-assessment domain
ABSTRACT
The use of ontologies, as tools to guide the generation, organization and personalization of e-learning content including e-assessment has drawn attention since they can represent the knowledge of a given domain and have the capability of reasoning about it. Although the use of these semantic technologies tend to enhance technology based educational process, the lack of validation to improve the quality of learning in their use, makes educator feel reluctant of using it. This paper presents the progress in an ontology network development, AONet, that conceptualizes the e-assessment domain with the aim of supporting the semiautomatic generation of it, taking into account not only technical aspects but also pedagogical one.
