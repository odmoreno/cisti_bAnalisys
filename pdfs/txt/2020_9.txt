Indoor positioning system using Beacon technology
ABSTRACT
The orientation in indoor spaces and the knowledge of the areas within an establishment such as companies, shopping mall, museums, universities, libraries, among others, is important to guide people through the architecture and areas that the establishment has, thus providing a better service, a quality experience and generating greater satisfaction. Sometimes it happens that there are people who find it difficult to reach a destination in indoors spaces. The attention or personalized guides that help guide in these situations are almost nil in some cases, which causes the user to give up in his search, it consumes a lot of time and generate disinterest in returning to that establishment. This paper presents a solution to the aforementioned problem and is the design and implementation of a system for indoor positioning using Beacon technology. The system consists of two parts, a web application for information management and a mobile application for interaction with beacons in order to guide users to their destinations or display notifications regarding the current location.
