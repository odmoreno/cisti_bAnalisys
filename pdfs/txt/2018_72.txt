The implementation of healthcare information systems: The role of commitment and usage in benefits achievement
ABSTRACT
There is an increasing interest in the relationship between the use of electronic medical records (EMR) and the production of health data. However, the assimilation of a healthcare information system (HIS) requires organizational changes in the practices of health professionals, which are not easily accepted by them. In a complex organizational context such as health, this information makes the role of the users regarding the adoption of a HIS, an important topic in the field of research of IS. In this sense, it is relevant to investigate how top management's commitment influences the commitment of the professionals in relation to the changes induced by the implementation of a HIS, as well as, in what way the HIS usage enables the achievement of expected benefits from its adoption. A qualitative, interpretative and case-based methodology was used, and the data was collected using semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and direct observation. Two Portuguese public hospitals were analyzed. It was found that top management's commitment, and that of the Clinical Directorate is a key factor in a more rapid and comprehensive implementation of the HIS, influencing professionals' commitment and the usage of the system, which contributes to the increase of the potential expected benefits.
