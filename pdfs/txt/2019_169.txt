Application of ICT and M-Learning to Improve Collaborative Learning and Interaction Using the Nearpod Platform
ABSTRACT
At present, university teaching develops in an innovative environment, influenced to a great extent by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) that present challenges for collaborative and interactive learning that is still developed in a traditional way in some institutions of higher education. The methodology used was based on the use of Nearpod platform through mobile devices, tablets or laptops, to improve interactivity in the face-to-face classes provided to students. The results obtained show that the students have had a favorable opinion and are satisfied with the use of this platform, because it allows to increase the interaction and participation in the activities in class. However, managing large groups presents difficulties due to the limited number of simultaneous licenses and the student's unstable connection to the institutional Wi-Fi internet network. Nearpod as a collaborative and interactive learning platform is a system that allows students to improve their concentration and participation, which is an opportunity to complement the learning provided by the teacher.
