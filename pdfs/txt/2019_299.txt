Study and analysis of data journalism practices and techniques in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
Technological advances are making it easier for news to be transmitted through different media thanks to digitalization and the Internet. But the promised potential quickly faded: the lack of investment, excessive voluntarism and distance companies/research led the communication industry to successive failures, with the closure of thousands of media around the world. Proposals are made to explore the possibilities of mobile devices and find an exit for the crisis that affects the communication companies. Our research focuses on offering a first approach to the implementation of Data Journalism in Ecuador, the tools they use and if there is a section dedicated to this branch of journalism. The Ecuadorian media still need to develop Data Journalism. The medium that broadcasts news with data is El Comercio.
