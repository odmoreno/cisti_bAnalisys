An information system to ease the creation and deployment of context-aware, location-based surveys
ABSTRACT
Mobile surveys are an important research tool. In mobile health, triggering survey questions based on patient health, context, and other external information can aid in tailoring a survey to each specific user's particular situation. However, creating such a survey with existing systems is burdensome. Therefore, this paper presents a novel information system to ease the creation and deployment of context-aware, location-based surveys. In a within-subjects experiment, 12 participants with minimal programming expertise created context-aware, location-based surveys more quickly and with fewer errors than with a competing commercially-available system that lacked support for questions triggered by physical phenomena, showing the potential usefulness of the approach for future research studies.
