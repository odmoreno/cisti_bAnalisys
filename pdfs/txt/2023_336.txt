Introducing Gamification Techniques into a Collaborative Mobile Application for Marking Locationsâ€™ Accessibility Level
ABSTRACT
In recent years, the need to guarantee access to people with limited mobility has made identifying accessible places to facilitate displacement and avoid possible barriers a critical task. In this sense, through an application based on maps and crowdsourcing, collaborative marking of locations is a viable alternative to maximize the identification of establishments and roads endowed with architectural resources that favor access. That is the premise of the Visibility application, which uses a map system to mark accessible locations and parking spaces for people in wheelchairs. This work aims to report the process of introducing gamification techniques to improve the engagement and motivation of the Visibility users to collaborate in marking places. Here we present the gamification techniques incorporated into the app, implementation choices, and results obtained so far.
