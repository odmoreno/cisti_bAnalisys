Automatic Resolution of Teacher Assignment Problem: A Bibliometric Analysis from 1976 to 2022
ABSTRACT
Using the bibliometric analysis methodology, we analyzed the scientific publications related to the Teacher Assignment Problem (TAP) published from 1976 to 2022 in the reference scientific databases. We began by identifying 190 articles, and after applying the exclusion criteria, 37 articles remained for analysis. Next, we identified the relevant authors, the most cited articles, source countries, and most popular keywords, as well as bibliographic coupling relationships, cocitation, and problem-solving techniques, allowing us to systematize and graphically illustrate the evolution of publications over time. In terms of automatic resolution techniques for TAP, we note that Integer Programming and its variants dominate with 16 articles. Next are the evolutionary techniques, where genetic algorithms dominate with 5 articles. Thus, on the one hand, we were able to obtain an overview of the scientific scenario of the evolution of publications related to TAP, and on the other hand, we verified that there is still margin for contribution in this area.
