Ef√Øicient and low-complexity space time code for massive MIMO RFID systems
ABSTRACT
In this paper, a Space-Time Block Code (STBC) based on the Golden number, Golden code is proposed for a massive MIMO-RFID systems. Based on channel modelling for massive MIMO-RFID system, the proposed space-time code is applied to the tag side. Simulation results show that the proposed code for massive MIMO-RFID systems outperforms Alamouti code while simplifying the receiver's complexity. The Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of the proposed technique demonstrates that high diversity gain for the tag is achieved leading to a highly reliable and more robust RFID range. Furthermore, the link capacity between the tagged item and the reader can be increased. The proposed RFID technique provides superior performance against the state-of-the-art RFID techniques.
