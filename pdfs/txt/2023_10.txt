Personalization of content selection in an enterprise LMS
ABSTRACT
A learning management system (LMS) is considered appropriate for company training. It is increasingly used in companies or organizations as a tool to manage their online training. The company or organization should consider the implementation of an LMS that provides ease in training content selection to achieve the best use and satisfaction of its employees in the learning process. From this perspective, the present study aims to investigate the implementation of a personalized LMS to facilitate the formative content selection tailored to employeesâ€™ roles. A Survey research methodology was used to achieve this objective. Based on the literature and survey results, we propose an approach to reach the personalization of content selection.
