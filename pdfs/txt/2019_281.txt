An APP to manage the calculation and graphing of the Water Quality Index (ICA): ICAGua
ABSTRACT
Water resources is everything that is linked to water and that exists in the earth, it is estimated that approximately 71% of the earth's surface is covered with water, of this 71%, 97% is salt water, which lexads us to affirm that one of the great difficulties that humanity faces is the amount of fresh water. Hence, the importance of preserving and using in an adequate way the fresh water that exists in the earth. In the present article the design and development of an APP in Android Studio is socialized, which by loading the Water Quality Index (ICA) measurements, at a given flow rate, allows the calculation of the ICA. The tool developed can be fed with data from the tributaries and calculate the ICA, a key data for decision-making in the bodies responsible for monitoring the proper use and conservation of water.
