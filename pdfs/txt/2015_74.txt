Automatic quality evaluation of machine-translated output in sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain
ABSTRACT
Automatic quality evaluation of machine translation systems has become an important issue in the field of natural language processing, due to raised interest and needs of industry and everyday users. Development of online machine translation systems is also important for less-resourced languages, as they enable basic information transfer and communication. Although the quality of free online automatic translation systems is not perfect, it is important to assure acceptable quality. As human evaluation is time-consuming, expensive and subjective, automatic quality evaluation metrics try to approach and approximate human evaluation as much as possible. In this paper, several automatic quality metrics will be utilised, in order to assess the quality of specific machine translated text. Namely, the research is performed on sociological-philosophical-spiritual domain, resulting from the digitisation process of a scientific publication written in Croatian and English. The quality evaluation results are discussed and further analysis is proposed.
