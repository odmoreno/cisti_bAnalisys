Social technology: The Solidarius app case
ABSTRACT
This paper considers the potential motivations of using a social application to make donations to needy families. Mobile devices and their inseparable applications are becoming more and more part of people's daily lives, who spend all their time with their always-on, always connected devices, as close as the body's own clothes. The study conducted, when addressing the social application Solidarius created to make donations to the social assistance group Sociedade SÃ£o Vicente de Paulo - Vincentinos, that the solidarity mediated by technology materializes in a new type of care. Although it is anonymous, it makes possible the existence of a bond, which excludes direct involvement with people in situations of common vulnerability in voluntary actions, but allows the user a sense of belonging to an institution or a cause greater than himself, generating feelings of satisfaction and gratitude.
