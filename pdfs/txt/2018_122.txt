Redundancy mechanisms applied in cloud computing infrastructures
ABSTRACT
Architectures and services that are provided by cloud computing system must have high availability, scalability, security and furthermore be fault tolerant. Plan these environments is not an easy task, it is necessary to ensure that undesirable situations or errors do not occur or can be minimized. The use of Sensitivity Analysis combined with the use of modeling hierarchy and the study of models for representing redundancy mechanisms arise in order to investigate the possible changes that these systems suffer and identify their shortcomings and propose improvements solutions for the planning of these systems. In this work the redundancy mechanisms is a solution to improve the performance of environments in cloud computing.
