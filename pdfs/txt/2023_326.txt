Road Education and GIS Technology as keys to the reduction of traffic accidents
ABSTRACT
The educational process, especially in childhood, is of vital importance for the development of the adult. In this work, this principle is based on the problem of the intervention on road education as part of the solution to reduce traffic accidents, especially in school zones. Based on knowledge of the context, information was collected through surveys that allow justifying that the intervention model in Ecuador easily distinguishes between provinces, especially those whose school zones are crossed by main land transport routes. The applied buffer model allows to easily distinguish the fact of the importance of the zones of influence on schooling, without neglecting the possibility of applying other algorithms such as clustering or regression that allow us to improve our proposal made in a single study for the Ecuadorian context.
