The Garbage Application to Luxury: Social technology and sustainable development
ABSTRACT
The effects of the environmental degradation and social exclusion produced by the rampant race for technical and economic advances have aroused the concern with the sustainable development of the natural resources. The movement has stimulated changes in social values culminating in the development of so-called Social Technologies, understood as tools committed to the principles of solidarity, preservation and social inclusion. Thus, the present article aims to present the web application From Garbage to Luxury as a Social Technology tool developed for the extension project Garbage to Luxury of the Federal University of Southern Bahia (UFSB). In general, it works as a Social Bank because it enables the application of the concept of social currency, where users “buy” clothing using recyclable materials as currency. It can be concluded from the actions carried out that the web application From garbage to Luxury served in a satisfactory way to the objectives for which it was conceived: to act as a social technology.
