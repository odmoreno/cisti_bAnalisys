The TdB application for the screening of children in vulnerability situation
ABSTRACT
Social business management deals with the balance between sustainability and social trade-ff. It requires careful management to guard against its financial vulnerability and to be sufficiently transparent in order to ensure its legitimacy with its target audience. The Turma do Bem is a Organização da Sociedade Civil de Interesse Público (OSCIP), whose mission is to change society's understanding about oral health issues, and dentist's over the social and environmental impact of their activity. The purpose of this article is to present a mobile application that automates the entire screening process of underprivileged children who are eligible for the free dental treatment provided by a volunteer dentist surgeon of theDentista do Bem Project. The TdB application was developed in iOS to perform the whole process of screening and reduce the flow of information on paper.
