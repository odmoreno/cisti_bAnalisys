Towards an Interoperability Management System
ABSTRACT
Managing interoperability in heterogeneous environments is of major importance for supporting collaboration between systems. Interoperability today is defined through the use of a Model Driven approach, which is able to represent information models and their transformations of constituent systems. Therefore, a solution for managing Model Driven Interoperability is needed. This paper presents the foundations of a solution for managing data interoperability within heterogeneous environments. Firstly, the key features of an Interoperability Management System are defined and characterised. Then a system architecture is proposed consisting of three layers: Interface, Kernel and Data. Finally, an implementation strategy is presented as the way to prove the proposed concept.
