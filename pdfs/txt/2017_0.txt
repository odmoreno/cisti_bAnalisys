Business intelligence in a public institution â€” Evaluation of a financial data mart
ABSTRACT
Organizations felt the need to quickly process information in an efficient way in order to support decision-making, thus leading to the emergence of Business Intelligence systems. Their use in organizations has become crucial in the treatment of large data volumes, and providing relevant information, in order to assertively support decision-making. This article presents the design of a data mart for the financial resources of a public organism with the objective of responding to the data visualization and processing needs of the respective organism. Posteriorly a prototype was developed with the objective of evaluating, through the TAM model, the usability, utility and easiness of use. The sample chosen to evaluate this data mart and the respective data processing was made up of university students who attended the curricular unit of Business Intelligence II and who had the knowledge to do this evaluation.
