Smart Contract and Web DApp for Traceability in the Olive Oil Production chain
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, people are increasingly adopting a healthier way of life. A healthy and balanced diet is essential for a better quality of life. A good diet helps to prevent and fight diseases. Thus, people are giving more importance to the food they consume. Consumers no longer seek foods based on their brand, but rather based on features such as nutritional value or sustainability. These features are directly related to all stages of a productâ€™s value chain, from its creation (cultivation) until it reaches the final consumer. In order for the final consumer to have access to this information, it is necessary to create ways to ensure that this information is available and reliable, thus consolidating consumer confidence. This article focuses on traceability in Olive Oil production chain and its quality indicators as well as social and environmental sustainability indicators. It is therefore intended to create a solution by using Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts.
