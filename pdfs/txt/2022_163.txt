Resilience Mechanism for Applications in Fog
ABSTRACT
In disaster response operations, a great deal of coordination of various agents and institutions is required. The use of tactical and operational software is of great importance for the success of the operation. However, how operations can take place in adverse locations with scarce Internet access resources. This limitation can generate problems in the functioning of applications that are in the cloud. Thus, in this paper, we propose a mechanism is designed that explores the concepts of resilience in a fog environment, focusing on the availability of applications. The main objective of these mechanisms is to guarantee the availability of services even in the event of connection problems. The case study was carried out in a simulated environment, and the results showed the feasibility of the mechanism to be applied in a disaster response Operations Center.
