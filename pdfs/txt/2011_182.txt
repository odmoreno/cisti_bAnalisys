Foundations for creating a Handball Sport Simulator
ABSTRACT
Recently there has been a growing interest by the sports' community (educators and coaches) in analyzing efficiently the performance of handball players and teams. The information collected from such analysis is used to better understand the difficulties of trainees, players or even entire teams and formulate adequate training and strategic plans. Usually this evaluation is too self contained and does not explore the many tools there are available nowadays. This paper proposes a simulation tool to tackle this problem and establishes the bases for a Handball Sport Simulator. The simulator developed has its origins on the Soccer Server simulator used on the RoboCup competition and includes the main handball game rules and player actions. This paper establishes the ground foundations for a Handball Simulator and results show that the handball rules and actions can be modeled.
