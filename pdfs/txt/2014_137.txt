Transaction management in temporal system
ABSTRACT
Timed data processing is a fundamental requirement for the database systems. It is not, however, only the changes in time management, but also the complex record of changes during the whole life cycle of the object - historical values, actual states, also data valid the future. Existing solutions are inadequate in terms of performance - effectiveness of the whole system. which is manifested using the size of the required data and processing time. This paper deals with the principles of temporal data modeling based on the column level, not the whole object and describes the structure and methods for manipulation. The proposed system is fully temporal and transaction-oriented. This solution is mostly designed for communication systems, intelligent transport system, where the performance based on speed and the size of the transmitted data is needed.
