ABSTRACT
In higher education, the improving learning strategies are a widely studied topic also considered a matter of concern to the teaching community. For that reason, the teaching team belonging to the Information Security subject applies the SEEQ questionnaire during the 2012-13 academic year. The SEEQ questionnaire has an extensive use trajectory in order to analyse the effectiveness of teaching. In the present contribution, we analyse both the results obtained from the SEEQ questionnaire and the effects from the inclusion of Digital Storytelling within the development of the ECTS activity during last year with respect to the previous year, in which it had not been applied.
