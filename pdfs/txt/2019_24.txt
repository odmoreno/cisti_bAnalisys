Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) using Augmented Reality in University Learning Scenarios
ABSTRACT
The present work analyzes the degree of technological acceptance of educational contents enriched with Augmented Reality (AR) by university students, mainly if these contents have been designed by some students to others. The research was carried out with students of the Information Technology Teaching Career of the Faculty of Human Sciences and Education of the Technical University of Ambato, who designed and created contents on a specific subject for a group of students of the careers of Educational Psychology and Basic Education. The process carried out to design the contents is described and the analysis of the experience is detailed through the TAM Technological Acceptance Model, the evaluation of the designed educational resource, as well as a pre-test and a post-test to evaluate the learning. In this particular experience of university education the results show that the use of AR has awakened a high degree of acceptance and motivation, and the contents enriched with RA have been easy and useful and have allowed an improvement in learning.
