In particular, the results of the analysis of the use of three chatbots, implemented in a higher education institution, are presented. The results obtained from the surveys, considering the usability of the chatbot and the accuracy of the responses, show that the level of satisfaction of using the chatbots is high, therefore, it is recommended to use this type of systems for the attention of users.
