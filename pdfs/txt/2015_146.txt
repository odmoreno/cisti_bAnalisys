Peer-review in architecture education: Application in Geographic Information Systems learning
ABSTRACT
This paper describes an educational experience in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) teaching in architecture with a double objective: (1) implement a peer-review exercise to promote critical thinking through the evaluation of the work of fellow students, and (2) explore the capacity of the group to assess the exercise with the support of a rubric. In addition to the outline of the experience, preliminary data showing a significant coincidence between self and peer-evaluation is discussed.
