ABSTRACT
The purpose of this communication is to identify to what extent the audio-visual sector in Latin America is taking advantage of the benefits of crowdfunding as a new financial strategy. To do so, on the one hand we have selected the international platform of reference, Kickstarter, and on the other, in order to facilitate the transfer of the specific aspects of the phenomenon to the spatial context in question, the most important crowdfunding platform in LatinAmerica, Idea. me. In order to determine the viability and behavior of this formula as a means of providing total or partial funding for Latin American audio-visual projects, we analyze the crowdfunding campaigns in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador that are included on the two selected platforms. Based on the results obtained, we show that variables associated with the quality of the product, its graphic presentation, the choice of a suitable platform, or carrying out a carefully targeted communication strategy through the social networks, help to increase the chances of success for crowdfunding campaigns in the audio-visual sector in Latin America.
