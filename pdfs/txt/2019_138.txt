The type-related methodology is used in order to determine the interaction between the use of the collaborative work tool called Padlet and student performance. For this purpose, nonparametric tests are applied and interpreted for the analysis of correlations and variances of the main variables. The selected population was the students enrolled in the classroom modality of the: Accounting and Audit, Business Administration and Chemical Engineering degrees of the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), corresponding to the academic period April - August 2018.
