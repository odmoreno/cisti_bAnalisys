Teaching innovation projects and their dissemination within a HEI
ABSTRACT
Innovation is the process of transformation and improvement of the existing. In the case of education, teachers can lead processes of educational innovation, which allow improving teaching-learning processes, also contributing to their own personal brand as educators. It is difficult to generate knowledge, but it is only when it is made known that its value can be considered. This study focused on how teachers perceive the process of dissemination of teaching innovation projects, taking as a reference the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja. Through a survey it was possible to collect the opinions of 63 teachers, and it was discovered that, although they recognize the efforts made regarding the dissemination of their work, they are unaware of the process itself, and that there are some opportunities for improvement in the internal communication of the projects being worked on within the university.
