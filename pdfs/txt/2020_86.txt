Tensions between Privacy and Targeted Advertising : Is the General Data Protection Regulation being violated?
ABSTRACT
The problem of data privacy on the internet takes on a large proportion considering that personal databases are a source of economic value for companies, which leads to an ethical and legal discussion. This article aims to examine privacy, addressing the issue of Cookies, used to obtain personal information from users for targeted advertising, even when there is no user consent, or such is compromised due to lack of information or knowledge. The article questions whether the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is being violated through this increasingly common practice of Digital Marketing. The methodology used was qualitative, descriptive and bibliographic, based on the GDPR and on articles on that matter. It was concluded that internet users are highly vulnerable regarding their personal data and that companies' digital marketing should be guided by the GDPR rules on the obtainment of Cookies for targeted advertising, which requires greater inspection over its compliance.
