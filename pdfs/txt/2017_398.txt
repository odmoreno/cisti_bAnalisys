Using CAATs in security audits: Web server access log analysis
ABSTRACT
Given the justified increase in concern with information security and since auditors are simultaneously in a privileged position and responsibility towards it, this article is intended to demonstrate how CAATs can be used for analysing Web servers access log files in a security context. Normally reserved to information security experts, this approach allows the non-technical auditor, using tools he masters and uses on a day-to-day basis, to analyze data that may indicate attempts of unauthorized access. This way the auditor gains valuable information, both for him and for his client, that otherwise in the event of being a smaller company and without the necessary resources, would not be discovered. Therefore, this paper also addresses the fact that any auditor may do the proposed verification tasks, with no need of additional background in programming languages.
