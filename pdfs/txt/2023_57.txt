A Multiagent Mediation System of Civil Actions of Contracts in the Consumption Relation Based on Machine Learning Strategies
ABSTRACT
A legal dispute of contractual relations, such as consumer relations, can be interpreted as a game played by the parties (players) and arbitrated by the mediator (Game Judge). In the physical world, each player in the game wants to win, without worrying about the other player. The objective is to win the game at any cost. Thus, thinking about this strategy, there is a reduction in your chance of winning the lawsuit. In the literature, in recent years there has been a dizzying increase in applications using Artificial Intelligence strategies to help model, simulate and make decisions in the field of Law. In particular, in this research and as a way of mitigating the problem of mediation of contractual relations, we present a Multi-Agent Mediation System for Civil Actions of Contracts in the Consumption Relation using Machine Learning algorithms for document evaluation. As a contribution, in addition to serving as a pedagogical support for students of legal sciences, the developed system is capable of identifying contractual documents that may prosper in a legal dispute with an accuracy of $89 \%$.
