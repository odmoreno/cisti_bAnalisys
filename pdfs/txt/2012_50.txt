Validation of the Electronic Portfolio Student Perspective Instrument: A study with Portuguese secondary school students
ABSTRACT
One of the potentials of regular use of computers and the Internet in the classroom is the development of ePortfolios. The use of this instrument is now considered relevant as a method of teaching, learning and assessment. The implementation of ePortfolios, performed by students in an educational context, can contribute to improving the quality of their learning and favors self-regulation, since it is based on reflection on their work. It is therefore important to build and/or adapt tools that allow us to accurately measure these dimensions, since the use of the Internet in formal learning is increasingly common. In this paper we present the results of a study on the implementation, analysis and discussion of how students engage in learning and foresee ePortfolios as a learning resource. We refer to the grounds and procedures adopted in the adaptation of the questionnaire - Electronic Portfolio Student Perspective Instrument (EPSPI) designed by Ritzhaupt, Singh, Seyferth and Dedrick in 2008, translated from the original version in English to the Portuguese and we also refer to the psychometric properties of sensitivity, reliability and validity.
