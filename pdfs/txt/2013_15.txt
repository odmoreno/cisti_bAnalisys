Software project management in small and very small entities
ABSTRACT
Project management is a discipline with an established and consolidated body of knowledge which is included in different models and standards. Small and very small software development companies have been more focused on establishing and improving their production processes than on managing the projects they carry out. This paper recommends a set of best practices to facilitate the implementation of project management processes in these organizations. The work consisted on analyzing the relationships between different standards containing project management processes. From the analysis of the obtained results, it is proposed to use the ISO/IEC 29110-5-1-2 Project Management process and complement it by the knowledge of the selected areas of the PMBOKÂ® Guide.
