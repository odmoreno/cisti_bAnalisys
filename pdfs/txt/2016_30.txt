Multimodel catalogue heuristics for software project managemet
ABSTRACT
Software development projects can be managed using traditional or agile frameworks. Combining these two approaches into a multi-model environment may help to include best practices from both frameworks, considering project management key factors. However, the implementation of a multi-model environment is complex due to the integration of best practices from different sources. Such complexity increases when the sources have different nature. This paper defines a set of heuristics and its graphical representation for using a multi-model catalogue for software project management. The objective is to homologate best practices of both agile and traditional frameworks in a multi-model environment, using a pilot validation of the proposal for the requirement management process in SCRUM and CMMI-DEV 1.3. Such validation allowed us to analyze the catalogue structure behavior and the heuristics. It also provided us an example of a multi-model environment for agile and traditional frameworks.
