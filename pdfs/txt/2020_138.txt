Study of routing protocols used in sensor networks for forest fire detection
ABSTRACT
Forest fires are a serious problem worldwide, thousands of hectares of forests are burned every year, to mitigate this problem that affects the environment new technologies are constantly born; One of them are wireless sensor networks (WSN) that allow the detection and monitoring of forest fires. This article makes a study of the routing protocols that are used for the design of a WSN, such as the level of energy consumption that they have. For which, a systematic review was carried out following the methodology of Barbara Kitchenham, in which, 20 articles were obtained from the research questions resulting in a list of the protocols used in the WSN focused on detection and monitoring of forest fires.
