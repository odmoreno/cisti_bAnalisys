Modeling scenarios using patterns linked to the business process model
ABSTRACT
The use of patterns in the conceptual modeling of systems has become relevant in Software Engineering and especially in the field of scenario modeling. This guarantees a certain level of quality and avoids the inclusion of errors. But there is no relationship between business models and scenarios that allows transforming one model into another, regardless of whether the systems model is a support model of the previous one. This document proposes a method for mapping the automatable activities of a Business Model to a Scenario Model in Transactional Systems. This objective is achieved through the analysis and transformation of Business patterns to Scenario patterns, for the construction of conceptual modeling.
