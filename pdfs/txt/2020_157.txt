Telerehabilitation based on serious video games as support in the recovery of the musculoskeletal system
ABSTRACT
The autonomous completion of the everyday activities of human beings with motor function problems improves significantly when evaluation and treatment processes are included in physical rehabilitation. These processes demand time, constant accompaniment and appropriate decisions made by the health professional, as well as a fundamental aspect, which is the motivation of the patient. This work presents a proposal for the development of a telerehabilitation platform which involves the use of serious video games, a motion capture system and a web application in order to support the recovery process of the musculoskeletal system. To begin with, this work presents a review of the literature that addresses aspects related to the rehabilitation of the upper limbs, using videogames and motion capture systems. The review identified that the use of video games continues to represent a significant contribution to motor rehabilitation processes, and that the main motion capture systems used are Kinect, some commercial systems, and other proposals that explore the advantages of the units of inertial measurement. Then, the methodological process leading to the development of a platform is put forward. Finally, there is a description of the basic characteristics of the functioning and the structure of the telerehabilitation platform proposed in order to offer a precise and motivating alternative as treatment.
