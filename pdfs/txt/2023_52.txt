Methodical Design: Intelligent System for Vehicle Congestion Using Micro-Controllers, Programmed Hardware and Patterns
ABSTRACT
The constant technological advances have led cities to adapt to current changes leaving aside the usual purely physical structures and evolve to a sustainable city, a city that has visions of improved urban development, which integrate technologies linked to the world of information and communication providing solutions to the needs of the inhabitants of a city. As a solution procedure, an intelligent traffic light is proposed, which is essential to the development and implementation of an intelligent city; in general, the construction of this prototype seeks to promote and contribute to the sustainable development of the city of Lima by eliminating the waste of time generated by conventional traffic lights. Through the construction of a device capable of making decisions about directing traffic between the intersections of Abancay, Manco Capac and Grau avenues in the city of Lima, we seek to control the north-south, south-north, east-west and west-east directions, optimizing waiting times and avoiding traffic congestion; In a more effective way we will take as a base the behavior of the current traffic lights, improving them by means of algorithms and programmed hardware, by means of micro controllers (Arduino mega) and cameras, thus generating emphasis in the management of information technologies.
