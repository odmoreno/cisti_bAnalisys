Performance Evaluation of Host Scalability in Software Defined Networks
ABSTRACT
Software Defined Networks allow flexibility for the management of computer networks due to the separation of the data plan from the control plan. As the network supports an increasing number of hosts, it becomes relevant to understand how the network performs. This article presents an analysis on the performance of SDN simulator networks as the number of hosts scales. The Mininet simulation ran 12 topologies, each of which with an increasing number of devices, initially on the number of client hosts and then on the number of switches. The analysis metrics were collected through network parameters of the TCP and UDP protocols. The simulations revealed that balanced networks distribute more evenly packet traffic and achieve greater performance.
