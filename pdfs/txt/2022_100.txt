A Maturity Model Proposal with Readiness Level Assessment for Organizational Processes Improvement
ABSTRACT
The improvement of organizational processes typically relies on opportunities identified by a prior assessment procedure. For example, process digitalization improvement in organizations requires prior knowledge of its digital maturity, thus operating as a starting point for the adoption of a validated and systematized methodology. This work presents a proposal of a maturity model with a readiness level assessment that takes advantage of competencies development, to promote cross-analyses of social and technical conditions within an organization. The adopted methodology is based on a pilot study developed in a hospital located in northern Portugal, being driven by a literature review regarding Maturity Models and Process Engineering. The proposed model will be validated in future applied research projects with companies also located in northern Portugal from the automotive, heavy metalworking, chemical-industrial, and logistics sectors.
