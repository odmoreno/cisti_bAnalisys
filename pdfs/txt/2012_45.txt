Towards an ontology network for conceptualizing e-assessment domain
ABSTRACT
With the advance in the Semantic Web and the technologies for its realization, approaches that use ontologies for different purposes in the context of e-assessment have emerged. One of these purposes is the use of ontologies as a mean of providing a structure to guide the automated design of assessments. Despite of the effort done in this direction, there is still a lot of work to be done due to the most of the approaches have proposed individual ontologies that model only a part of the assessment domain. This paper presents an ontology network, called AONet, that conceptualizes the e-assessment domain with the aim of supporting the semiautomatic generation of it, taking into account not only technical aspects but also pedagogic.
