Developments to improve teaching with 3D images
ABSTRACT
The use of graphics in Industry is something completely normal as used to be in education, something different is the way we can apply the concepts. The idea of this document is to show the ways we think industrial graphical systems can be applied in education to increase the way students can learn some kind of skills. In the industry graphic systems show the ways in which the systems are working and operating displays of DCS (Distributed Control System) displays operational information in 2D, 2.5 or 3D environments. Educational graphics are being used to show tales, math, physical or other objects in 2D, this limits the full awareness situation of the things that can be showed to students. To enhance the characteristics of educational graphics we propose the use of some industrial tricks to increase the students' attention and understanding of situations. We think that this increases the amount and quality of information that may be given to students and prevents unnecessary time consuming in explanations.
