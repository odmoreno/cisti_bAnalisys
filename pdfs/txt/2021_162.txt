Risks Factors that Influence a Data Center Infrastructure through the TEMAC method
ABSTRACT
The paper presents an analysis of the risk factors that influence a data center infrastructure, by means of the Theory of Meta-Analytic Consolidated Approach (TEMAC). After bibliometric research in the Web of Science and Scopus repositories, 96 relevant results were found. For the analysis of co-authorship, co-citation and bibliographic coupling, heat maps were produced to facilitate the visualization of relevant authors and works. As for the analysis of the frequency of the keywords in the selected articles, terms with high frequency in the two databases were extracted, such as: security; network; risk; energy; management; virtual and service. As a result, 11 highly relevant articles were obtained that presented 10 risk factors that influence the evaluation according to the unique identifiers of 3 functions and 8 categories of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, being: i) governance; ii) supply chain risk management; iii) identity management and access control; iv) data security; v) information protection processes and procedures; vi) protective technology; vii) anomalies and incidents; viii) continuous security monitoring.
