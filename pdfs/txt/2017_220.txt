Towards the construction of a data visualization tool for geriatric centers
ABSTRACT
Older adults can suffer from neogogenerative diseases, which makes them dependent on trained personnel in geriatric centers. The main contribution of this paper is a conceptual model that seeks to delineate the implications for the design of a data visualization tool for older adults's care centers. The proposed model is created through grounded theory. The results obtained in the qualitative analysis emphasize the primary role of staff in identifying the contextual factors involved in the care and monitoring process of older adults in geriatric centers.
