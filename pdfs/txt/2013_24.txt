An extension of the comparison between the requirements modeling methodologies: Mind Maps and KAOS
ABSTRACT
The authors present a comparative study between two different approaches for modeling requirements: KAOS (keep all objects satisfied) and Mind Maps. The experimental research method was employed to perform such research. The survey was applied to three groups in order that two groups consisted of researchers and the third group were members of a software development company. For this reason, the overall results obtained with the experiment indicate that both methods converge when the goal is to identify an object type whereas they diverge when the goal is to identify others. Therefore, the overall results help the researchers and software developers to understand what doing and implementing a consistent and logical modeling.
