Level of satisfaction of hybrid and online educational systems in university students during Post-Pandemic times
ABSTRACT
This study aimed to establish the predictor variables in the satisfaction of the educational service implemented during the post-pandemic, such as the intention and use of the system, the interaction with teachers, the methodology in teaching, and the relationship with students. The research is non-experimental, applied, and comparative. The study used 162 students from a private university in the Arequipa area of Peru as a sample. The methodology that was used had two well-defined phases: first, an exploratory factor analysis was performed, which aimed to condense the information in the original variables into smaller series; second, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed by modelling structural equations based on variances. It is concluded that the intention to use hybrid and online systems, interaction with teachers, and teaching methodology are predictors of satisfaction in university students in post-pandemic times; however, the relationship with students does not positively influence the satisfaction of the educational service. However, there are differences in the detailed analysis of the hybrid and online systems.
