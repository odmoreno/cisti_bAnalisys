Proposal for a new information systems architecture for the national statistics institute of Mozambique
ABSTRACT
The literature already established has shown the importance of information systems and technologies for becoming increasingly a factor that currently differentiates successful organizations, augmenting, increasingly, the dependence of the organizations on assistance provided by these resources. Its impact is very significant in organizations where the final product is information, such as the National Statistical Institutes, whose mission is to produce and disseminate official statistical information of general interest of a country. It is believed that using the systems and information technology most problems would be minimally resolved and that would also considerable productivity gains. Found, however, dissatisfaction for results, in most cases, due to poor standardization of technology, poor alignment between existing information systems within the enterprise and business processes, leading organizations to lose their productive capacity, was found an opportunity to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the best results through the design of a new architecture of its information systems with a high level of technological standardization and alignment with the business, and as a case study of Mozambique's National Institute of Statistics.
