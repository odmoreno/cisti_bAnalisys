Recognition Strategy of a 3D printed model for an Augmented Reality system in the Maintenance of Electric Power Substations
ABSTRACT
This scientific article presents a prototype of an Augmented Reality (AR) application for maintenance of components in electrical substations. The study highlights the importance of maintenance to ensure the safety and reliability of substations, and describes the difficulties faced by maintenance technicians, such as the lack of precise and detailed information about the components. The developed AR application allows for the visualization of information and technical data of the components and equipment in real-time, through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Such characteristics of the application allow for visual inspections of components such as circuit breakers, facilitating the identification of faults and possible repairs. Tests conducted with the AR application showed promising results for improving the efficiency and precision of maintenance of electrical substations.
