Smart Monitoring of Traffic Status through an Online Tool Supported by Business Intelligence
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies are revealing themselves as an opportunity for the progress of smart cities, where business intelligence is being key for efficient management and fast data processing as in Intelligent Transport Systems. This paper presents a work in progress on smart city management, whose main result is the development of an online monitoring tool for traffic analysis based on Microsoft Power BI. To this end, this manuscript describes the use of distributed information sources —both locally and in the cloud— to analyze the state of road congestion. The main goal is to provide users with historical data on urban climate, location of pedestrian crossings, public road congestion and other useful information that allows a better understanding of the state of a city.
