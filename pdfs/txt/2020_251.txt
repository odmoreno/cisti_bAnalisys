Design and validation of a comprehensive evaluation proposal for MOOC-type courses
ABSTRACT
The massification of content for online teaching has intensified deeply thanks to the rise of Digital Technologies in education. While it is true that the dissemination of educational content is fundamental in social development, so is the quality of the content, of the teaching mediations and the evaluation structure. This article mentions the results obtained when designing a methodological proposal for the evaluation of a MOOC-type course for teaching differential calculus, presenting the validation structure of the instruments through which it is operationalized. As a result, in addition to presenting the validation structure of the instruments, a methodological framework is designed in which aspects of interaction between motivation, self-regulation, internet use styles and conceptual domains are evaluated.
