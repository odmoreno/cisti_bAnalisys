Is it a lay or medico-scientific concept? Automatic classification in two languages
ABSTRACT
Searching for health information is the third most popular activity on the Internet. There is evidence that query suggestions in lay and medico-scientific terminology improve health information retrieval by who is not a health professional. Developing systems that suggest queries in these terminologies requires knowing if concepts are lay or medico-scientific. In this paper, we propose and compare approaches to compute the degree of association of a concept to lay and medico-scientific terminology. We use different thesauri for this purpose and use the cosine similarity to measure the closeness of concepts with subsets of those thesauri. The evaluation of our approaches uses an existing glossary containing concepts in both terminologies in English and Portuguese and a and a set of queries submitted by users and classified by health professionals as lay or medical-scientific. We concluded that the best method to classify a concept uses the CHV vocabulary as a subset.
