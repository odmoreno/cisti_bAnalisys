Framework for selecting solutions based on Geographic Information Systems
ABSTRACT
Due to the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), tasks that relied on extensive ranges of time and resources they have been simplified. At present, there are a variety of alternative SIG, hampering the decision making when choosing a suitable GIS for a specific project. Therefore, in this paper a framework that supports decision-making in the selection of GIS in an organization of any type and size is presented. This framework has been generated from a deep research capabilities and success stories of GIS in organizations. The framework is based on two factors: technical feasibility and economic viability. The selection method is applied to a case study in which GIS viable solutions that fit the attributes of the company are analyzed. Authors intend in the future to develop a framework-based software to facilitate the incorporation of GIS in organizations.
