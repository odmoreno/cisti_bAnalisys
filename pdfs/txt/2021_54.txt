Platform for real-time data analysis and visualization based on Big Data methods
ABSTRACT
Data is one of the most important and essential sciences for visualizing graphs. Analysis and visualization techniques are widely used to create metrics and predictions about the context. The present work is part of an engineering design of surfaces project, which proposes a model of analysis and visualization of data using temperature and pressure sensors at plastic injection machines. The objective is to monitor the data collected from the manufacture process of plastic molds. The result was achieved by developing a model for analyzing and visualizing data in real time, with sensors that collect temperature and pressure data, and the possibility of viewing the application’s data history. It is also possible to monitor the alerts that the model can trigger based on the collected data. Through the developed dashboards, it is possible for production managers to have at their disposal a decision support system that aggregates information of productivity and the need for preventive maintenance of equipment’s.
