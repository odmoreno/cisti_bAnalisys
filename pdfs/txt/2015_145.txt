The electronic booklet in the school-Family relationship: Perceptions of teachers and guardians
ABSTRACT
This article presents the first phase of a research project whose goal is to introduce a new form of collaboration and communication between the school and the family through an Electronic Booklet (EB). We sought to identify through a questionnaire the perceptions of teachers and Guardians regarding the adoption of an EB. Both groups stressed the importance of communication between school and family and expressed interest in the EB as a communication tool.
