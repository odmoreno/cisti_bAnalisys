ABSTRACT
The article aims to analyze the determinants of the intention to continue using online learning in the classrooms of the first courses of the USFX Business Administration Degree, the success of online learning programs does not only depend on the degree satisfaction of the students for them, but also for the intention to continue using them. The intention to continue using this type of learning will be determined by perceived social ability, willingness to learn and perceived usefulness. The online survey was adopted in the research with the Google forms tool, for which a structured questionnaire was designed. and it was applied to 260 registered and active students in the subject of Information and Communication Technologies of the USFX Business Administration Career. The data processing with multiple regression was specified, and the analysis was carried out with the model of structural equations (PLS-SEM) that allowed the verification of the proposed hypotheses. The results showed that the students under study agree to continue using online learning as they agree that it will be useful in their current and future learning process, improving their social interaction skills with their teachers and peers in turn. Continuing with the use of virtual education empowers them to achieve greater productivity and achieve their academic goals without restriction of time and space and helped by the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the regular quality of Internet access and the use of cell phones by some students for online education limit the reception and use of virtual training.
