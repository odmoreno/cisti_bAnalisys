U-til: lightweight approach for traceability management between user stories and test suites
ABSTRACT
Tracing the numerous artifacts produced during a software project is challenging. It is not uncommon to overlook this aspect due to the additional workload to keep organized and effective records of what changes between iterations. In this work, we propose a lightweight approach called U-til for traceability management focusing on the impact of changes in both user stories and test cases. We have conducted a case study to assess the proposal's impact concerning the efficiency to manage the requirements traceability from the point of view of testers and requirements analysts in the context of an industry software project. We performed quantitative and qualitative analysis before and after applying our approach and observed that it helped the team to manage requirements dependencies and improved the traceability between user stories and test cases.
