A decision support system for assessing the construction of road infrastructures
ABSTRACT
Decisions about the construction of new public infrastructures have been increasingly based on cost-benefit analysis. Apart from this kind of analysis, risk analysis and other issues related to the regions in which the infrastructures are located must also be taken into account. Automating such analyses does sometimes present some challenges, because of the specific issues that must be considered in different problems and in each particular situation. This paper presents the solution that was developed for producing a system that supports decisions about the investment in some road infrastructures, considering the particular issues that arise in each one of them, and also allowing an integrated analysis of related infrastructures.
