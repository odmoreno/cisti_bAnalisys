Web API BLE Communication using .Net Core
ABSTRACT
When the need arises to add Bluetooth support to existing applications, the solution often comes down to third party libraries. When developing .Net Core Web APIs however that support is strangely absent. By using a desktop-oriented library and a set of BLE devices an API was developed to assess real time access to them and provide proof of concept that data gathering is possible. The processed data is then provided to other apps using the restful API methods, developed under the .Net Core framework. Said data can then be used to supply dashboards, data analysis tools, or other fitness and wellness related applications. The API developed ultimately provided proof that it was possible to communicate with Bluetooth devices using asynchronous communication in a web application while repurposing a desktop application-oriented library. Further developments can increase the number of compatible sensors of the developed API for it to be able to use a broader number of devices, support more profiles and services and thus increasing its initial range.
