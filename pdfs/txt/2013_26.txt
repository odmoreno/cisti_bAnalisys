Method of interaction in open innovation processes incorporating ubiquitous environments and web 2.0 social networks: A baseline architecture
ABSTRACT
In this paper, a baseline architecture of a method for the interaction among stakeholders in open innovation processes is proposed, integrating collaborative features of electronic social networks and the properties of ubiquitous environments, leveraging access everywhere and everytime. In order to propose this architecture, the layers an relations among them are proposed. After that, the components inside each layer are detailed. Finally, a catalog of techniques and strategies is generated in order to tackle each module, clearing up that all the layers can be customized according to the particular needs of the company which wants to use this method. This work offers: baseline architecture; definition of stages, activities as well as transition artifacts which are generated throughout the innovation/co-creation process; ubiquitous environment characterization; set of ways to ease the interaction among stakeholders based on the good practices and tools offered by social networks. Partial conclusions reveal the importance of establishing mechanisms to ease the interaction between the stakeholders who participate in a co-creation process by means of the cutting edge technologies in other application fields.
