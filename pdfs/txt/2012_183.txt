A survey on Ambient Intelligence projects
ABSTRACT
Intelligence is increasingly emerging in our ambients. Evidences of this emergence are the existence of smart homes, smart vehicles, intelligent manufacturing systems and most importantly, the appearance of the concept of intelligent cities. Humans are presently surrounded by technology that is intended to increase their quality of life and simplify their daily activities. Multi-Agent Systems are an example of technology that can be used in these activities. The concept of ubiquitous computing is implicit in these technologies and can generate an invisible ambient of interactivity. This paper presents a survey and a comparative analysis of some of the research projects concerning Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The main objective of this work was to understand the current necessities, devices and the main results in the development of these projects. By analysing these projects using several evaluation criteria one of the main conclusions is that most projects do not explore the potential of human profiles in the context of ambient adaptation. Thus, this may be a very interesting research area for future work.
