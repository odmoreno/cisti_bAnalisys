System for monitoring the spatiotemporal behavior of tourists
ABSTRACT
The spatiotemporal behavior is the pattern of displacement of the individual in time and space, being of fundamental importance to tourism. It is important to know the main factors that interfere with this behavior and what information is needed to better manage related services and products in order to increase the quality of the experience offered and ensure sustainability. This paper theoretically contextualizes this problem and presents the architecture of a system that, serving tourists, tour operators and tourism managers, ensures a mechanism for counting and tracking tourists, enhanced by the provision of information about tourist and commercial points of interest. The system involves a server in the Cloud, which stores data and is accessible via a REST API from a mobile application. The application interacts with Bluetooth Low Energy signal emitters installed at various locations. The development follows the Design Science Research. The phases of problem identification and tentative artifact design are presented in this paper.
