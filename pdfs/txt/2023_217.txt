A comparative study between the performance of relational and graph databases applied to hierarchical queries
ABSTRACT
The use of hierarchical queries makes it possible to search for information in databases that are organized in different levels of hierarchy. Both in relational databases and in graph databases, it is possible to use specific languages to make this type of query and efficiently obtain the desired results. However, depending on the case study, these queries may be better suited to one database paradigm than another. This article aimed to carry out a comparative analysis of the performance of hierarchical queries in the DBMS Oracle (relational) and Neo4j (graphs). To this end, a comparative study was carried out, with real data from the National Council of the Public Ministry (CNMP), with a focus on evaluating the execution time of such consultations. As a result, it was identified that, for the specific case studied, the DBMS Oracle presented better results than Neo4j.
