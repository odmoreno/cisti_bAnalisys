Prototype industrial IoT applied to temperature monitoring in storage silos of dairy products
ABSTRACT
The productive chain of a dairy industry contemplates the pasteurization of milk, in which the temperature has the main role, therefore the quality of the final product depends on this variable. This evidences the need to continuously monitor the temperature value in each of the tanks belonging to the pasteurization process. Based on the above, the objective of this paper is to propose an architecture applied to remote temperature monitoring in storage silos of dairy products. As a result, a functional prototype was developed and evaluated in the ECOLAC industry. The IoT prototype captures the temperature data by means of thermocouples, digitizes them and sends them to a web server via WiFi connection, the user can access the data through web-browser on a computer or on a Smartphone. In the evaluation of the behavior of the prototype, a maximum relative error of 3% was obtained.
