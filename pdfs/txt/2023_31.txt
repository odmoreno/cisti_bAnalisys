The use of Information and Communication Technologies to report on Sustainable Development Goals in Portuguese Municipalities : Case study of ODSlocal platform
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have brought new opportunities for interaction between municipalities and their citizens. In this sense, it is appropriate to understand how digital platforms, such as the ODSlocal, are being used for reporting on projects and good practices that contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the municipal level in Portugal. Through the application of non-parametric tests, it was possible to determine that the reporting of these practices is not uniform between municipalities, since it varies according to their location, dimension and adherence to sustainable networks or programs. Thus, a more robust focus on ICT and promotion of local community participation is suggested for the SDGs achievement.
