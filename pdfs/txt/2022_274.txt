Logistic Sensorization for an industrial process
ABSTRACT
In the last years, a revolution is changing the way to understand and manage the interaction between humans and machines. In the area of the industry, has a higher influence and it is encompassed in the term Industry 4.0. This revolution, generate a new era, in which virtual manufacturing and productive systems work together with the physical ones [1]. This will require the evolution of the production plants to develop to the "Smart Factory" [3], where it is necessary connect all systems or machines, to enable the interaction between machine and human, as well as machine-to-machine, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT). To achieve this level of connectivity is necessary to implement sensors in all systems or machines of which data acquisition is required. Focusing in the logistic of a plant, the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology is one of the most used, but this this technology has some constraints that must be addressed, as the limitations of the power supply from the RFID "tags". In this article, it will deepen in how to improve the autonomy of the power supply of the "tags", with two proposals to optimize the use of the sensor, taking in account the type of logistic management implemented.
