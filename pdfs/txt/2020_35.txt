Serverless based control and monitoring for search and rescue robots
ABSTRACT
The number and scale of disasters, being natural or human made, has influenced the creation of search and rescue missions and the use of modern technologies in them. Robots have become an attractive and more common tool in these operations. Even though there still are challenges to overcome with them. These challenges arise predominantly in the way they are controlled and monitored. Challenges like complex and costly infrastructure are the main obstacle to have a widespread use of these robots. This article presents an architecture for the control and monitoring of search and rescue robots based in serverless technologies to reduce infrastructure complexity, cost and setup. A custom methodology was used based on investigation, design, implementation and validation to develop this architecture. Design considerations, usefulness, limitations are analyzed and discussed. Overall effectiveness of the architecture in search and rescue missions was found a future work for improvement has been established.
