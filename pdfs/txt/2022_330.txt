The Role of Digital Communication in the Tourism Promotion of Low Density Territories: The Case of Macedo de Cavaleiros and Vila Nova de Foz Côa
ABSTRACT
Technology applied to communication has eliminated barriers and allows companies and entities to interact more easily with their audiences. In fact, the value chain in communication has become shorter and a direct contact with different publics (including tourists) via social networks and other means of communication is becoming more and more usual. In this paper, through the collection of secondary data available online, it is made an analysis of the use of digital communication by two low density territories (Macedo de Cavaleiros and Vila Nova de Foz Côa) both with world heritage classified by UNESCO. The main conclusion obtained is that both municipalities are far from the potential of the interaction possibilities opened by digital channels, suggesting some forms of action with a view to its improvement.
