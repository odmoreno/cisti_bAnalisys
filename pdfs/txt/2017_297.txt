Technologies to support language teaching: Experiences and oral exercises
ABSTRACT
The domain of the mother tongue is essential for human communication and for its involvement in society. Oral communication takes on special importance in this relationship with others. The teaching of the Portuguese language has been the subject of discussion in order to improve the education of the language of the country highlighting the fundamental role that schools have in the process. In view of the evolution and ease of access to the technologies, we started a study to identify its potential in the teaching-learning support of the Portuguese language. We focus on the 3rd cycle of basic education where we created the course called "TAEP" (Technologies to Support Portuguese Teaching) where we carry out numerous experiments based on activities related to the curricular goals of the official program of the discipline.
