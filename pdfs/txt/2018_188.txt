A systematic review on the development of interactive environments for rehabilitation from injuries caused by stroke
ABSTRACT
The general approach of the work described is to develop a Systematic Review to assist health professionals, specifically Physiotherapists, collecting data about interactive environments used to assist in the treatment of injuries from stroke. Although the area is well studied, it is necessary to take into account the lack of studies that mix the development of the environments, as well as the interactivity with the patient. In this work a Systematic Review was conducted in which 13 scientific papers published on virtual and interactive environments were studied until June 2017. The main essence of this study is to provide technologists, physicians and physiotherapists a better and continuous approach to offer the patient, ways in which one does not have to sacrifice oneelf or consider such monotonous procedures.
