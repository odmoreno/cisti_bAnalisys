Detection of sleep disturbances for road prevention
ABSTRACT
The detection of drowsiness signals is, of course, an important aspect of road safety and prevention, but the current systems have not been shown efficient, because alertness only arises when the individual is already in a state of drowsiness and episodes of sleep and micro-sleep at the wheel continue to exist, with known consequences. In addition, detecting signs of drowsiness (or better yet, predicting a state of drowsiness is insufficient because it warns that the problem exists (it is a reactive system), but does not understand or resolve it, for this it is necessary to carry out the evaluation of the quality of the sleep and the detection of disturbances or disturbances of sleep, not forgetting that each individual has a circadian rhythm that may not be compatible with the rhythm of their daily activity. However, the rigorous evaluation of sleep quality and the detection of sleep disorders requires a set of clinical equipment that is costly and incompatible with daily use. It is necessary to create a low-cost system that is capable of detecting the possible existence of sleep disorders and classifying each individual relative to their circadian rhythm in a non-intrusive way.
