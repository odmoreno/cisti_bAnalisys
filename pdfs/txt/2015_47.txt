Low cost storage devices with interfaces for educational applications
ABSTRACT
This article aimed to show the current reality of existence and use of technological resources that exist at school. It was possible to accomplish and check through the holding of workshops on the use of technologies, in particular the use of Pen Drivers what is common for students. However, only as long as file systems. The UPA project-A Flash Drive per pupil consists of storing large volumes of data with alternative operating systems and interfaces as innovations that can be used in teaching. With that, provided the digital inclusion of teachers PARFOR students, who were the subjects of research, and to identify and access the technological support they have in the everyday life of the school. The research presents partial results on the use of mass-storage devices in the public schools. Also, is justified by the opportunity to research the use of systems that require innovations of the interfaces that the current technological landscape features. The methodology followed the field research with quantitative empirical based approach. With it, obtained partial results regarding this topic currently present in the school space.
