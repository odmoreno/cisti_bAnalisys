A Web application for learning and training of mouse handling as an interaction device in digital environments
ABSTRACT
In this article, we present a solution for training the mouse input device handling, in order to improve the users' digital skills. Knowing that the widespread access to the computer and the Internet is still made by the use of traditional devices, such as, the keyboard and mouse device (and these devices does not provide natural interaction between people and technology), it is necessary to train for the correct handling. Specifically, mouse usage requires movement control, hand posture and finger positioning, as well as, precision clicks for different functions (one click, two clicks, drag and click.) This training is often done in real interaction situations, that could led to inefficiency of use the digital environments and also user's frustration and discouragement. Thus, using simple and intuitive interfaces and providing a set of activities, we allow users to learn and train the motor coordination and basic movements with the mouse. The main results of the study showed that users had a pleasant experience of interaction, considered the interfaces intuitive and affirmed their availability to use it as a training tool.
