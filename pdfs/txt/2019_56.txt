Solving the Regenerator Location Problem using bioinspired algorithms
ABSTRACT
In optical networks, the signal strength deteriorates as it gets further away from its source. This happens due to deficiencies in the fiber (attenuation, dispersion, conversion). Therefore, we can say that the distance a signal can travel without losing or corrupting information is limited. It is necessary to regenerate the signals periodically using regenerators. Given an optical network, the regenerator location problem tries to install a subset of regenerators with the minimum possible cost, in a way that each pair of nodes can communicate with each other. In this paper bio-inspired algorithms are used to solve this problem. Results obtained using 480 different instances prove their efficiency in solving the regenerator location problem.
