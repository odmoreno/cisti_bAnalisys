Platform to approach employer-graduate in higher education Portuguese institution
ABSTRACT
The employability of its graduates has been a primary goal of the higher education institutions. The institution support to its graduates is of higher importance, in times of lower employability, since it can make a difference to those studying on it. The new legal framework for higher education institutions in Portugal incorporates this trend and requires to institutions the development of strategies that potentiate the employability of its graduates, amongst others evaluation factors. This paper presents a work that has been developed using new technology platforms with the aim of bringing together graduates and employers.
