Spanish FabLabs Cartography
ABSTRACT
The Speculator Progress of the FabLab movement has brought new possibilites for users to be prosumers - this is consumers who can become creators of their own products. Its worldwide expansion - especially in Europe- and the differences between FabLabs makes it interesting to design a cartography that places the laboratories prsent in spain and that allows identifying their own characteristics, similarities nad differences between them. We used a multidimensional calling Analaysis(MDS) to locate the elements analysed in a two-dimensional space: Spain FabLabs Cartography. Finally, a cluster analysis is carried out to validate the suitability of this Cartography.
