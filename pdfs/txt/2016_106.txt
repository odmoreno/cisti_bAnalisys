Case based learning for therapeutics: Student's performance in face to face vs blended learning
ABSTRACT
The adoption of E-Learning activities by higher education institutions, is considered an important contribution for new learning opportunities, both in terms of initial, as well as lifelong training. In the field of clinical education and training, educators and clinicians are gradually recognizing the potential of ICT for learning purposes, practice and assessment of knowledge. In medicine and nursing, there are extensive examples that illustrate the adaptation of technological components and teaching methods. However, as much as it was possible to ascertain, examples are scarce in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In this paper we propose to explore a case based learning approach for the teaching of therapeutics, using blended learning. When in comparison with face to face setting, our results show a significant better performance in the blended learning group.
