Collaboration and inclusion for massive open online courses (MOOCs)
ABSTRACT
MOOCs are coined from the theory of connectivism which, through cMOOCs, aim to provide an environment in which participants are, in addition to apprentices, producers, in a collaborative way, sharing knowledge in a network. Because of the “open” and “massive” characteristics, a MOOC is committed to attending to the knowledge society, and that all people have the necessary conditions to access, regardless their differences. This research aims to write guidelines for collaborative and inclusive MOOCs conception. As methodological procedures, there is a qualitative and exploratory research, which applies the phases (discovery, interpretation, ideation, experimentation and follow-up) to detect the problems and difficulties for each disability, through techniques such as observation, focus group and Delphi method. As a result, it is expected to obtain an instrument, containing guidelines for collaborative and inclusive MOOCs.
