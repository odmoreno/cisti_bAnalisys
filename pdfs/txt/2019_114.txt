Codeflex: A Web-based Platform for Competitive Programming
ABSTRACT
The academic environment is undoubtedly one of the main means of introduction to the field of computer programming, however, in this environment, where practice is crucial for the development of solid foundations, the number of given assignments falls short from ideal, especially because of the time it takes to evaluate the proposed solutions. To fill this gap, a web platform has been implemented to serve as a repository of programming problems, for practice and learning, but also with a section for competitive programming. Above all things, the platform is capable of evaluating user's submissions in real time. The solution for evaluating submissions involves the use of compilers associated with their programming language and a parallel execution to bring improvements in resource usage efficiency.
