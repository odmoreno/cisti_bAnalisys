Data and information fusion in the context of emergency management: The DF100Fogo project
ABSTRACT
Situational Awareness (SAW) is a widely-used concept in areas that require critical decision making, such as in the field of emergency management. Forest fire information management in protected areas is an example of a situation where the need for SAW and more assertive decision-making is critical to ensuring a better allocation of resources for emergency response. For an emergency management system operator to make a more informed decision, it is necessary to obtain the most complete and accurate information possible to acquire SAW. This work aims to present a process of fusion of data and information from multiple sources to produce more significant information and with reduced distortion from fire reports, aiming to stimulate the SAW of Fire Brigade operators and support brigades to amplify the control and extinction of fires in the Federal District (Brazil). A case study is presented using real data and the application of the proposed merger process, to demonstrate the applicability of the work.
