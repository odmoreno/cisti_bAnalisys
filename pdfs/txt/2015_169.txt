When the pair programming should be adopted in a business environment
ABSTRACT
Currently there are several questions about the pair programming adopt. Is the pair programming more productive when compared to individual programming? When a company must adopt pair programming? To answer these questions the authors of this paper developed 7 controlled experiments, 4 of them in the academic environment and 3 in a software company. The experiments show that the pair programming should be used to production of code highly complex. Based on the results generated by the experiments, the authors of this study conclude that the pair programming should be adopted only in a business environment to solve problems (programs) complex. To detect the complexity problems the company has a defined and institutionalized software process.
