Performance evaluation of embbeded system for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
ABSTRACT
The present article analyzes the efficiency of the Embedded System for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring developed by the researchers of the Technical University of Ambato as a tool for the diagnosis of hypertension. Analyzing the structure, architecture and communication technologies between patients and the medical server, evaluating two possible scenarios in OMNET ++ 5.0: first using a communication in wireless local area networks and second using mobile data networks. The results obtained from the study in the first scenario, determine a reliability of 98% for communication and delivery of information between users and the medical server. In the second scenario, working on the LTE mobile data network reveals a probability of data packet loss of 4.26% per day in a study case of 150 users.
