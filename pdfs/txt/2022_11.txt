Perception and Precaution of Online Aggression: : Info-communicational behavior in the face of risks in the Portuguese university environment
ABSTRACT
The use of digital technologies is increasingly intense and widespread. However, this intensification is also accompanied by significant growth in young Portuguese people involved in cyber-aggressions. As public policies and social interventions try to reduce the number of victims, online aggression has considerable negative repercussions for the people involved. Thus, identifying the dangers that constitute the most significant risks related to cyber-aggressions, analyzing the causal contexts, and the difficulties in their precaution help elaborate comprehensive and effective policies at the national level. The purpose of this investigation is to understand how young Portuguese people perceive the risks associated with online aggression and to verify what precautionary behaviors they take when facing such risks. Data will be collected from university students, which represent the social fringe that most uses digital technologies, constantly being exposed to the risks of experiencing cyber-aggressions.
