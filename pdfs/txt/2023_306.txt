Knowledge management in online travel agencies
ABSTRACT
Online travel agencies are described as a digital service for selling products related to travel, accommodation, activities, airline tickets, car rental or other services. Several companies in the tourism industry have adopted knowledge management as a way to gain competitive advantage over their competitors. Currently, it is still difficult to find research works that relate knowledge management to online travel agencies, which are an important part of the tourism industry. In general, knowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge to increase productivity and efficiency in organizations. The purpose of this paper was to determine the relationship between knowledge management and online travel agencies. To accomplish this goal, a literature review was conducted with the purpose of defining a conceptual model that frames and relates the best practices of knowledge management with online travel agencies, namely by sharing information and knowledge. As a result of this work, it is found that strong leadership characteristics supported by an organizational culture are the essential pillars in the effectiveness of knowledge management. With this work it was also possible to attest the importance of using technologies to support knowledge management for the interaction between the different actors in the process. This paper presents a model of knowledge management in online travel agencies. In this model some practices that contribute to knowledge dissemination in digital travel agencies are identified, in line with the results of the literature review process.
