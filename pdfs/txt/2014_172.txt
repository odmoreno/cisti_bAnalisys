ABSTRACT
This study explores the relationship between Social Media engagement and the activation of the consumer's purchase process. Following a consumer behavior perspective we study how the new communication paradigm of the Web 2.0 has change the first stage of the e-commerce purchase process, the problem recognition. We use the case of a smartphone purchase, to explore how differences in Social Media (Facebook) engagement would help describe existent differences between the consumer's triggers for problem recognition. The results suggest that there's a relationship between the level of engagement and the consumer's state that influences the activation of the problem recognition. Implications for e-commerce and Social Media managers are discussed.
