Digital illiteracy, internet use at work and economic growth at the provincial level in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
This research analyses the relationship between digital illiteracy and the use of ICTs on economic growth measured by the Gross Value Added at the provincial level in Ecuador. A panel model was used to show that digital illiteracy has a negative impact on growth, while ICT use has a positive impact. Finally, one of the main recommendations is to encourage access to technology and thus increase economic growth in a sustainable way in the provinces of Ecuador.
