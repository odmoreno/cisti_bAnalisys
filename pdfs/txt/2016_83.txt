Framework for evaluation of digital citizenship among less favored population in Brazil
ABSTRACT
This article aims at presenting and summarizing the main concepts of citizenship, digital citizenship and digital inclusion, within the concept of citizenship construction. The methodological approach is essentially explicative, bibliographical and documental. We begin with a state-of-the art of the topic, which is necessary to prepare the well-documented empirical investigation that will be carried out after this piece of work. We discuss a new approach of digital citizenship, based on the information and knowledge society and we propose a framework to assess it, taking into consideration the direct and indirect impact of the digital inclusion programmes on poor populations, in Telecentros, in Belo Horizonte (Brazil).
