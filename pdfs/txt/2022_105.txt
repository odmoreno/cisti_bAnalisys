Business not as usual: Understanding the drivers of employees’ tacit knowledge sharing behavior in a teleworking environment
ABSTRACT
In recent years, companies have differentiated themselves from their competitors through their intellectual capital, an essential resource for survival. However, despite the growing number of studies in understanding the transformation and impacts on firms resulting from the pandemic, the literature is still scarce on understanding tacit knowledge sharing behavior during the lockdown period. This study contributes to the existing literature exploring the organizational and individual factors that influence employee knowledge-sharing behavior and, consequently, strengthen a firm’s intellectual capital while in teleworking mode.
