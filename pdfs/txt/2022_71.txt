ABSTRACT
The objective of the research carried out is to determine the behavior of the university students of the city of Sucre in the face of the intention to undertake within a businessincubator, for this purpose it has been worked under the modelof the Theory of Planned Behavior of Ajzen, which has allowedto determine which are the main factors that influence the timeof undertaking within a business incubator, analyzing the four constructs of the model such as: entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial intention. Using the PLS-SEM program, the following results were obtained; the intention to start a businessthrough an incubator is 76%; the subjective norms explain the entrepreneurial attitude in 66% and the perceived behavior control in 62%, with a correlation from acceptable to optimal, however, the entrepreneurial attitude towards entrepreneurial intention presents one of the lowest ratios of 0.26. Based on the results obtained in the IPMA matrix, it is suggested to considerthat the environment is very important for students with regardto entrepreneurship, so they could use the services of a businessincubator, this implies the importance of restructuring the attitude entrepreneurial, since it was validated that it is a construct that is not directly related to the entrepreneurialintention. The findings reached contribute to the knowledge about entrepreneurship and serve as support to establish policies and action strategies aimed at the execution of a business incubator within the University.
