As a measure to reduce the number of people infected by the disease, the National Health System (SNS) started to require the COVID Digital Certificate, so that the citizen has access to certain places. The present study is a qualitative methodology, action-research, and aims to evaluate the difficulties that the elderly find to access the COVID Digital Certificate, through the application made available by the SNS, and evaluate the benefits of the Iconographic Tutorial/ Certdigit@l.
