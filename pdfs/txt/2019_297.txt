Linear Programming with CPLEX: An Illustrative Application Over the Internet CPLEX in Fortran 90
ABSTRACT
The Internet provides a medium for solving problems, namely scientific, for the industry or academia, an important one being Linear Programming (LP), illustrated here as an application of computing “over the Internet”, our style of computing. We present the use of CPLEX, a powerful LP solver, through its API with a Fortran 90 program, a combination scarcely seen, which we implemented, solving two exemplificative problems. The computing application runs on the Linux server of the university, as might be of a company, needing no proprietary plug-ins (as Java, Flash). Our objectives are: to provide an open solution to LP problems; to remind the use of the CPLEX API called from Fortran; and to indicate the Internet as a convenient computing medium. This problem and many others can be freely solved on the authors' webpages.
