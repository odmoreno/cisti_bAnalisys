Artificial neural network to analyse the customer profile of a sanitation company of São Paulo city
ABSTRACT
The sanitation sector of São Paulo is responsible for a significant share of the brazilian market and the private sector participation in this segment has gained strength in recent years. To address the needs of the population and also give returns to shareholders, the sanitation company is constantly seeking to improve their results. Increase sales have become a major challenge for the managers of commercial areas. One way to increase the commercial efficiency is through the use of the large amount of information and data stored on corporate systems. The aim of this paper is to analyze the consumer profile of a sanitation company of São Paulo city, obtained from a Data Mart by a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network. The results obtained are positive and demonstrate the acceptability of decision making.
