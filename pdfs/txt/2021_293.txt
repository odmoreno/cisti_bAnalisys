Social representation of immigrant women in Chilean digital newspapers
ABSTRACT
In the context of the rapid growth of the migrant population in Chile in recent years, this research will analyze the social representations that the digital versions of the Chilean newspapers Las Últimas Noticias, La Estrella de Valparaíso and La Estrella de Antofagasta present regarding women immigrants in the country. It will be analyzed from June 1, 2017 to July 1, 2018, due to the fact that this period saw the greatest increase in the arrival of foreigners to Chile and with it the consequent increase in their appearances in the digital press. To do this, the news will be studied through a Content Analysis. The study reveals that the aforementioned media constructed immigrant women under a class logic, in the sense that they are classified as first and second category.
