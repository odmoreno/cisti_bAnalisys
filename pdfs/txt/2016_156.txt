Proposed framework for the CSIRT protection
ABSTRACT
Currently informatics resources are facing major security challenges carried out by hackers or computer criminals, which are increasing in number and improving their methods of attacking computer systems. For this reason, Equipment Computer Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) has been created to respond to several attacks in accidents or security breaches in the information resources of organizations. However, the CSIRTs also are vulnerable to cyber attacks as any other organization and we need to establish security measures for their operations. This paper presents a proposed framework for the CSIRT information protection. This framework is based on security controls to hardware and software that support risk analysis in order to have an overview of the main assets of CSIRT.
