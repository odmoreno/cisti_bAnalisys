Tracepp requeriments traceability tool: Extending the scalability of the trace++ technique
ABSTRACT
The adoption of agile methods is difficult. No rework metrics, changing scope and requirements are the main difficulties in adopting these. In this sense, the Trace++ approach aims to facilitate the adoption of agile methods by teams that work with traditional methods. However, to obtain use-scale, this paper proposes a tool to facilitate the requirements traceability processes, in order to scale the adoption of this technique. The tool developed in this study has integration with GIT version control tools and Redmine project management, being able to obtain artifacts from these and to associate with projects, sprints, requirements or user stories, through user defined tracing codes.
