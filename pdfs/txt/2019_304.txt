Acceptance of electronic games by the senior population
ABSTRACT
The phenomenon of growth of the elderly population associated with information and communication sciences and technologies has inspired several research projects that seek alternatives to include this part of the population to this new reality. From the bibliographical survey on the state of the art, most of the studies considered the variables gender, physical situation, digital inclusion and socialization of the elderly. A study appended [20] considered the variables gaming narrative, social interaction and health condition as direct predictors of intention to use digital games, proposing a model of use and acceptance of the extended technologies. In this context, and in view of this identified gap, this research proposal seeks to identify characteristics that facilitate and/or promote the acceptance of electronic games, their use and the learning of information and communication technologies by the elderly population. These characteristics will be used as variables to be incorporated into the TAM-TPB model [19].
