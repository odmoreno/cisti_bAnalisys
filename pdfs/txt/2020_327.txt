Co-creating value in European Public Service Media An analysis of 4 succesful co-creation experiences in public television
ABSTRACT
The arrival of new content distribution platforms, alongside with the audience's new habits of consumption have challenged the role of Public Service Media. This has forced public broadcasters to approach co-creation with the audience as a fundamental feature for the fulfillment of their innovation, participation and representation responsibilities. Co-creation, more intensely researched in the area of advertising, is, however, still uncommon in the realm of PSM academic work, s to its innovative and socializing potential. This paper compares 4 relevant co-creation cases in Ireland's RTÃ‰, Germany's ZDF and RTVE in Spain, with SBS Australia as a 4th case for contrast purposes. The aim of this study is to identify the values that emanate from these formats in the social responsibility framework of PSM, determine the social agents or cultural intermediaries that participate in co-creation and study the capacity of these formats to represent the more disfavored demographic sectors.
