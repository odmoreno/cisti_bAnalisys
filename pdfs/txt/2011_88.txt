Enhanced operator interface for DCS
ABSTRACT
The distributed control systems (DCS) are control devices used in processes industry, in which the operator is converted in the essential part, because he/she should take operation decisions that can generate dangerous situations and/or big money losses. This suggests that any improvement that helps to the operator in the selection of the correct decision, will redound in a decrease of these losses of operation. This paper shows the works that are being carried out in the creation of an Enhanced Operator Site; so that the operator diminishes its stress, he/she increases his/her knowledge on the real situation of the process and he/she increases the quantity and quality of information that he/she has at his/her disposition. It is achieved it by the use of 2.5D or 3D systems that they facilitate the understanding of the process, together with the use of advanced devices for the administration of alarms or warnings.
