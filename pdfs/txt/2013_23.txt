CLIDONT â€” System for treatment of clinical data with risk factors analysis
ABSTRACT
The development of information systems in healthcare has grown considerably in recent years. With the evolution of systems based on distributed processing, using the Internet and cloud computing systems can develop much more effective and efficient, particularly in the health field. The proposed system involves the creation of databases, distributed or not, with integration of Web services that may give access to clinical data in patients by using of a health card, accessible through electronic reader devices (micro-chips) or by scanning, namely through a mobile device. The project will consider the legal and ethical aspects underlying medical activities, so that only authorized personnel have access to this information. Although there are integrated systems for registration of clinical data in Health Centers and Hospitals, this information is not available to be accessed remotely via a Smartphone or Tablet / PC. The system presented here, will allow access and registration of clinical data remotely, either by medical assistance teams, or by medical teams that serve patients in the usual places. To this end we propose the creation of an electronic health card that will be the primary means of transaction data.
