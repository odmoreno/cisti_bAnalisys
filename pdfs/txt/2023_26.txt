Possibilities of Adopting Electric Vehicles in the Agritourism Development Context
ABSTRACT
In a society that is looking for ways of sustainable development, the use of electric vehicles (EVs) can be an applicable solution in different fields of activity, including the tourism industry. The current research analyzes the possibility of using Buggy EVs in a predominantly agritourism region. In this sense, with the help of STELLA Architect, dynamic modeling software, a simulation is run to determine the potential behavior of tourists who use different types of off-road vehicles and their willingness to become Buggy EV users. Based on the data obtained, an algorithm is developed to size the fleet of Buggy EVs necessary for carrying out the activity, taking into account the most important characteristics of the existing Buggy EV, namely range, charging time and price. The results obtained from the study can be used as a starting point for improving the tourist experience, by integrating the technology we are so connected to.
