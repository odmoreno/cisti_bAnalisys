When Technologies Drive Pedagogy Learning and Teacher Training
ABSTRACT
In the field of educational technologies, the authors intend to support the hypothesis that although learning is usually attributed to students, it is also true that teachers learn, just as societies also learn. The coherence and concern of these different levels (students, teachers, institutions) around the issue of learning can, in the authorsâ€™ opinion, be considered as a guide and as a sign of quality education. In this case, the general models of learning and development of pedagogical devices can be questioned in order to develop new uses, teaching methods and teacher training, to promote technological innovation in institutions and validate their quality.
