The evolution of dashboard in research : An VOSviewer analysis
ABSTRACT
Information is currently considered an essential element for companies. As a result, the emergence of Business Intelligence (BI) tools has become imperative, enabling quick, efficient, and data-driven answers and utilizing dashboards to data visualization. Dashboards provide information that enables the analysis and the assessment as a basis for decision support. This paper focus is on the bibliometric mapping VOSviewer software, to analyse research trends and the most used keywords in scientific papers. Maps were presented with main keywords, taking their frequency, grouped into six clusters in order to understand which research area they will fit into. Considering the 64 keywords collected according to the established filter, and a minimum of 25 occurrences each keyword in the 6302 collected papers on the Web of Science database. Results demonstrated that the “Decision“ cluster predominates and the “Actual“ cluster has been gaining dimension in the last few years. As a conclusion, the importance of dashboards is evident, with the main focus on decision support, highlighting an increased interest in topics related to the future.
