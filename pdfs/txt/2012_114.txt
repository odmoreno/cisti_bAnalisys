Problems with the use of 3D environments in DCS: New model of visualization in operation displays
ABSTRACT
An optimal operational environment of DCS (Distributed Control System) should facilitate a perfect and full “situation awareness” about the state of a process, that it was being supervised. This suggest us an improvement of the interface, using a 2.5D/3D environment, it can increase the quantity and quality of the information that the operator has to work. This new environment was designed trying to cover the “best practices” about the design of 2D displays' layouts and adapting those that they were impossible to import to 3D environments.
