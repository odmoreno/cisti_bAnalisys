Peruvian millennial tech consumer's perceptions of Apple's eco-friendly position at the Keynote in October 2020
ABSTRACT
Throughout the evolution of the mankind, the use of technology has been contemplated as a tool to solve and facilitate from simple tasks to more complex scenarios that were presented to the society. These technological tools have improved exponentially every year, surpassing the limits established by their previous models, becoming protagonists of transcendental social transformations. The eco-friendly social trend, increasingly strong in different industrial sectors, has reached the influential technology company Apple. As a result of this trend, the company has been forced to make some business decisions about its products in order to achieve a socially responsible brand image, which has had an effect on the relationship with its consumers. This research seeks to know in depth the response of this group of people - immersed in the technological culture - to this new communication scheme that Apple has assumed as part of its brand identity.
