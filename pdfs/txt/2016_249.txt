From learning to game mechanics: The design and the analysis of a serious game for computer literacy
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design, development and analysis of a game for computer literacy. Specifically, the game addresses educational objectives included in the curriculum of non-technological careers, such as the identification and analysis of concepts related to basic hardware components of a computer. These objectives are joined with those of a video game, i.e., live an attractive, motivating and enriching experience. The game has focused on the interaction between the player, who plays the role of a student, a 3D virtual computer, and a character who plays the role of the teacher. The player interacts with the computer and answers a series of inquiries posed by the teacher, all related to components of the 3D computer located in the game scenario, which represents the teacher's office. For each correct answer, the player receives a sounded feedback and messages of encouragement from the teacher, as well as points. Once the player completes each level, the result is stored and can be displayed in a scoreboard. Game analysis has been done using the so-named LM-GM framework, which is an analytical model proposed by GaLA (Game and Learning Alliance, the European Network of Excellence on Serious Games), that maps learning mechanics (LM) to game mechanics (GM). The results of the analysis indicate that the serious game seemly integrates learning objectives as well as LM and GM.
