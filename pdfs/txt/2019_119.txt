Situations about telemedicine in Colombia: Between the legal and the legitimate
ABSTRACT
This is the result of the analysis of the legitimacy and legality of Communication for Health among individuals who interact in cyberspace, mediated and conceived by modern technologies such as information technology, telematics and cybernetics. A bibliographic review was done using the empirical - analytical method to describe the impact of Telemedicine on users, a technology recently used in Colombia, which promises to become a tool that will support the solution of some health problems. Its development must be linked to the use of regulations that imply “Must be“ and its application must be decided in accordance with the legal principles, which compel the doctors and technicians to be accountable. The incessant development of medical technology, in its application in telemedicine, can lead to the vulnerability of ethical principles, and with it, the damage and misinterpretation of Medical Law. Also, to the possibility of rationalizing the criminal and civil responsibility of the medical practice in the service of telemedicine in Colombia. For this last, the authors of this text, we help with interviews and surveys with experts in telemedicine, especially in the city of Medellin, all in light of Colombian legislation. The truth is that the practice of telemedicine in Colombia has regulatory gaps that, if not remedied, sooner rather than later, will mark serious difficulties for the progress of this practic.
