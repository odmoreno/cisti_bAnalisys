ICC â€” Integrate cognitive competences for incorporating technology into educational processes: Initial research
ABSTRACT
The ongoing communicational transformation brought on by digital technology and the increasing imbrication of reticular ecosystems amplify their effects and changes in social life, defining new relationship configurations. The practices and trends of incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into education, published in the past five years, points to a trend of simply transposing everyday ICT into school processes, without taking into account the necessary pedagogical, technical and conceptual adjustments, nor other factors of the educational complexity. The literature reports inappropriate technology use in educational processes even when supported by intensive use of resources. This research project aims to contribute with the development of a new educacional model based on Integrated Cognitive Competences for incorporation of technology in the educational process as a way of overcoming these difficulties.
