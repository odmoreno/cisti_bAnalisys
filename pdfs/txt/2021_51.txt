An end-to-end cryptography based real-time chat
ABSTRACT
Confidentiality protects users' data from digital eavesdroppers when traveling through the Internet. Confidentiality is complex and costly, especially on applications that involve communication and data exchange between multiple users. Cryptography has been the most used medium to achieve confidentiality, being the greatest challenge the sharing of a secret key to a group of people in a safe and effective way. This paper presents a chat application that implements an innovative way of sending messages with end-to-end encryption, in real-time, with a dynamic key store, and without the existence of data persistence. The application stands out from the others by the fact that it innovates the way the keys are shared with multiple users.
