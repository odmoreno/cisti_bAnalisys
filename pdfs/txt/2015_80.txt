European Portuguese validation of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ)
ABSTRACT
The Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is a 19-item instrument developed to assess the user satisfaction with system usability. The PSSUQ is widely used and robust in psychometric terms. This paper presents the process of translation, cultural adaptation and contribution to validation of the European Portuguese version of PSSUQ. The study is divided in two phases, the questionnaire translation and adaptation and the questionnaire validation. The questionnaire translation resulted in a Portuguese European version of PSSUQ equivalent to the original in terms of semantic and content. The second phase consisted of the validity and reliability assessment. The PSSUQ has excelent internal consistency (Î± = 0.80), as well as, satisfactory inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.67). The PSSUQ presents construct validity, with a high and significant correlation with an overall usability evaluation question (r=0.84, p<;0.05). The PSSUQ presents discriminative validity, distinguishing applications with distinct quality.
