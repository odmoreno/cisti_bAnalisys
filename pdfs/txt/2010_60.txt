An ontology for semantic definition of learning objects
ABSTRACT
In order to incorporate learning processes to the Semantic Web, it is essential to count on mechanisms for semantic definition of learning material that guarantee material interchange and reuse. This paper presents the development of an ontology that formalizes description of learning resources according to the IEEE Standard for Learning Object Metadata. This ontology adds the conceptual structure of learning object metadata and implements existing relations among them, in order to emphasize their pedagogical meaning. This paper describes learning resources with formal semantics procesable by machines and it offers a solution according to the challenge of sharing information independently generated in distributed way by dynamic sources. The developed ontology optimizes learning processes because it helps students, professors, designers of learning material, and automatic processes of software in their searching, acquiring, and using of learning material. This ontology establishes mechanisms and processes tending to solve differences arisen by the administration of information with multicultural origin and the advent of complex environments with incompatible semantics.
