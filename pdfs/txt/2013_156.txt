Problem-based learning for skills development in advanced communications
ABSTRACT
The development of skills through active learning methodologies has been demonstrated to be appropriate in environments where students must acquire particular professional capacities. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) embeds strudents' learning processes in real-life problems so, they can integrate different subjects in a common project that they need to solve in a self-directed way. In this context, we propose an innovative vertical learning project in the Telematics Engineering Grade at University of Extremadura. This paper focus on one of the sub-projects, related to advanced communications technologies. We describe the experience of the PBL activities. Finally, we show that the project has obtained satisfactory results in both academic and development skills terms.
