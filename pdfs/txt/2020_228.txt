Decision Support System based on Competitive Intelligence and Genetic Algoritms
ABSTRACT
In recent years, one of the main areas of research in information retrieval has been configured by Genetic Algorithms, a practice within the field of Artificial Intelligence. His research, through the work of numerous authors, has allowed us to develop a genetic algorithm and implement it in a case of DSS (Decision Support Systems) based on Competitive Intelligence and Technology Monitoring processing which gives a better understanding of how those can contribute to the improvement of information retrieval through optimization of users queries in Information Retrieval Systems and how in turn, the results obtained can be applied to knowledge generating tools for organizations and provide positive results.
