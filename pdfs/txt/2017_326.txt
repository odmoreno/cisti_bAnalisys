Development methodology of the HISMM Maturity Model
ABSTRACT
Maturity Models have been introduced, over the last four decades, as guides and references for Information System management in organizations from different sectors of activity. In the healthcare field, Maturity Models have also been used to deal with the enormous complexity and demand of Hospital Information Systems. This article presents a research project that aimed to develop a new comprehensive model of maturity for a health area. HISMM (Hospital Information System Maturity Model) was developed to address a complexity of SIH and intends to offer a useful tool for the demanding role of its management. The HISMM has the peculiarity of congregating a set of key maturity Influence Factors and respective characteristics, enabling not only the assessment of the global maturity of a HIS but also the individual maturity of its different dimensions. In this article, we present the methodology for the development of Maturity Models adopted for the creation of HISMM and the underlying reasons for its choice.
