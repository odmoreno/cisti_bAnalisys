A system to Support the Physiotherapeutic Treatment of Chronic Pain in the Spine
ABSTRACT
Backache is one of the biggest worldwide problems and has been studied by researchers worldwide. Nevertheless, there is a gap of applications to support the decision making in physiotherapy treatments. A possibility is to verify if there are patient's evolutionary patterns and thus, to understand if it is feasible to generate an early evolutionary prognosis before the beginning of the treatment. Hence, this work introduces an information system that allows maintaining the data of patients and their entire treatment, from therapies adopted to patient's evolution. The system was evaluated in the development environment to show its feasibility in a few scenarios. The next step is to apply appropriate data analysis techniques to support a more personalized treatment.
