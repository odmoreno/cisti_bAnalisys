Learning Monitoring Model with Biometric Devices for Business Simulation Games: PBP Methodology
ABSTRACT
Implementing business simulation games (BSG) to empower people is becoming a highly sought-after teaching strategy for universities; however, real-time monitoring and analysis of aspects related to learning and its relationship with elements provided by the game during its use still need to be studied. This work aims to present a proposed methodology for monitoring these simulators of organizational environments based on analyzing the playerâ€™s experience supported by biometric devices. The proposed experimental model, called PBP, considers an analysis from three perspectives (Physiological, Behavioral and Psychological), a combined way to offer usability information that occurs in real-time. With the application of the method, it is expected to explore to the maximum the potentialities and main resources that are significant for the players, collaborating with insights so that the developers can improve these educational support tools to prepare and motivate the professionals with the best skills and competencies needed to stand out in the labor market.
