Factors affecting problem-solving behavior: Emotions and motivation in a gamified reward experiment
ABSTRACT
The present study aims to study the effects of the leaderboard, comparing it to monetary reward in problem-solving behavior. Following the psychological perspectives in the context of rewarding, we study how motivation, reward emotions and task emotions can change problem-solving behavior, using the case of number puzzle solving task (Sudoku). The results indeed indicate that there is a relationship between problem-solving behavior and positive reward emotions which were caused by the leaderboard. Also, the results show that a positive emotional reaction to the task could improve problem-solving behavior in a monetary reward condition. Implications in the design of rewarding programs are discussed as well.
