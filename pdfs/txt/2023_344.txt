4D BIM Supporting the Construction Planning Process
ABSTRACT
The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology has been adopted in the construction industry, supporting the development of projects. Its implementation has improved the collaboration and integration in the design context, increasing the accuracy of the project preparation and the decreasing additional costs and delays of the construction work. The main objective of the present research is to provide an overview of the state of the art of BIM applications, namely, concerning the construction planning. For that, the generation of a BIM 3D model, involving the disciplines of architecture, structures and water supply system was performed. After, over the model a conflict analysis was applied, in order to verify the consistency of all the disciplines, when linked together. In order to obtain a visual simulation of the construction process, the correspondent 4D BIM model was also generated. Along the development of the study, several BIM software were applied over a case study. The main remarks of the capacities of the software, as well as the benefits and limitations verified were identified.
