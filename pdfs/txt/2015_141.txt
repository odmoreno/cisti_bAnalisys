A decision support platform for IT infrastructure management: The university of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro services of information and communications case study
ABSTRACT
The society and technologies evolution has resulted in a trend towards a growing amount of data stored by organizations and of the needs inherent to the analysis of that same data, in order to obtain information and knowledge generation. Based on this assumption it became critical to use new and more efficient technologies for processing that data in order to be able to get quality information in a timely manner. In order to meet the previously identified needs, various types of systems have emerged, whose features incorporate data processing functions and obtaining information for supporting decision-making processes. Examples of such systems are the DSS and the use of BI architectures. Given that currently many of the organizations services are supported by the existent IT infrastructure, it is necessary that these are suitable for the supporting the proper functioning of the available services. Assuming the previous concerns, the team inherent to this article assumed as very important to conceptualise a decision support system to address this adequate dimensioning of a University IT infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, the Information and Communications Services (SIC) of the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD) were used. Through the implementation of this decision support system, the SIC/UTAD improved their ability to make more informed and conscious decisions, thus optimizing and control more effectively the UTAD IT infrastructure.
