Availability and sensitivity analysis in video streaming services hosted on private clouds
ABSTRACT
Cloud computing have one technology development that favor various computing services and storage over the Internet. The multimedia services are examples of these new services will now use this new technology. About the multimedia services, we highlight the streaming video service, where the user can access your videos from these cloud environments with the same quality practiced in traditional environments. In this paper, we used the models to find the RBD availability of streaming video services in a test environment assembled in the laboratory to evaluate the system. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify the critical points of the system with respect to availability so that you can act on them and thus improve the system availability.
