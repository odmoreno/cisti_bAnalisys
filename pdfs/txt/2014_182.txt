ABSTRACT
The new generation of e-learning, commonly referred to as s-learning aims at the elimination of physical, social and cultural barriers and harnessing the potential of Web 2.0 in education. Allows a strong motivation for learning shortening distances between people and creating communities that share the same learning interests and goals. This paper introduces the concept of Social Learning and propose a concrete format for its implementation. We report the implementation of a course at a vocational training center in this model and we analyze the results obtained.
