Routes Generation for Selective Collection of Urban Waste using Volunteered Geographic Information
ABSTRACT
Population density in city centers has been overloading public services. The use of new information and communication technologies can help minimize these problems. The objective of this project is to present a method that uses Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) to help finding a solution to one of the existing challenges in urban areas: the destination of recyclable solid residues. By applying VGI to garbage collection services, more specifically to the route generation process, both for conventional collection and for reverse logistics methods, we wish to increase population participation, increase number of recyclable residues collected and reduce of logistics costs of the process. The proposed method's potential is presented through a simulated case for a medium sized city.
