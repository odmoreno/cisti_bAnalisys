Performance analysis of AES encryption operation modes for IoT devices
ABSTRACT
Daily activities have been increasingly supported by intelligent devices and applications. Smart devices are constantly communicating through the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, either by sending collected data and notifying the actions taken or by receiving instructions for actions to be taken. Most of this communication requires the confidentiality of data through the usage of encryption algorithms, being the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm one of the most used. However, how do the operation modes of AES algorithm perform in a resource-constraint device? This paper aims to evaluate the impact on the time to encrypt and decrypt different sized messages in IoT devices when using each one of the five AES modes of operation and the three key sizes defined. The test scenario was implemented using two programming languages, running on a Raspberry Pi device. The results achieved infers that Python was quicker and had a more homogeneous result set than JavaScript implementation in most AES operation modes. These results help to understand the trade-off between IoT devices' security needs and delays in communication caused by the selection of the AES algorithm operation mode.
