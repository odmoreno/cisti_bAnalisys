Improving actuator-sensor-actuator communication performance in WSANs using a multicast approach based on bloom filters
ABSTRACT
In Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs), to ensure the communication between multiple actuators is an essential issue. In line with this, we propose a multicast routing protocol, named Multicast Border Oriented Forward Routing Protocol (M-BOFP), whose communication between actuators is performed by multicast implemented on top of the network of sensor nodes. The M-BOFP takes advantage of the Bloom filters, a probabilistic data structure with low memory cost, to carry information of multicast groups requiring low and fixed message overhead. This paper presents preliminary results of the comparative analysis between the MBOFP and its precursor the BOFP. For this analysis, we carry out a performance evaluation of the proposed protocol considering different scenarios representing small, moderate and large-scale networks.
