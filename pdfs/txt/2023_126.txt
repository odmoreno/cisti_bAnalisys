Determining environmental indicators related to the propagation of contagious diseases and health issues: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
The environmental indicators provide significant information in order to describe the state of a phenomenon, environment or area [1]. This paper addresses the indicators present in the air and their relationship in the accommodation and transmission of viruses, as well as how these environmental indicators can lead to health problems. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to review the scientific contributions in the literature in order to determine and select the potential environmental indicators present in indoor environments which have an impact on the health of people who work and live within these spaces. For this purpose, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to environmental monitoring, COVID-19, Internet of things, air pollution and environmental indicators within indoor spaces. This SLR allowed us to identify indicators that according to their level of presence can represent a high risk for peopleâ€™s health. Therefore, the process of planning, conducting and reporting the Systematic Literature Review enabled us not only to identify some environmental indicators, but also their corresponding monitoring advantages and disadvantages, and multiple perspectives and approaches of each contribution in the literature. Further on, this study will be the basis for the proposal of an automatic and intelligent platform based on Internet of Things for monitoring indoor environments in order to detect high risk levels for the contamination of contagious diseases.
