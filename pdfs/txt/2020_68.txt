Matrix of guidelines to improve the understandability of non-expert users in process mining projects
ABSTRACT
Process Mining is a discipline that recognizes three types of analysis: discovery, monitoring, and process improvement. Organizations are focusing on redesigning and automating their major processes, according to a report published in 2018 [1]. In this way, a challenge n process mining is to show the results of the process analysis in a way that is understandable to non-expert users. Therefore, this research paper introduces a matrix of guidelines to guide process mining specialists/tool developers to improve the results of the analysis in process mining projects. This matrix is composed of 2 study fields that throughout the literature have been merging their virtues. First, process mining under 2 of its 3 types of projects: (1) based on objectives and (2) based on questions. The last type is based on data (exploratory analysis). Second, visualization of data with its techniques to represent data graphically. This research proposes a matrix of guidelines that integrates the discipline of process mining and the set of data visualization techniques based on the purpose of each graph (technique), the question / objective to be achieved and the importance that colors take in the analysis results in the process mining projects.
