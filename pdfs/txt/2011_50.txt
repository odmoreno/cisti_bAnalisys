Turnover impact into organizational knowledge management. The case of employee turnover in Portuguese real estate
ABSTRACT
Current society faces great transformations; one of such is employee turnover. This phenomenon makes organization loses not only capabilities but also customer relationships, image, routines, and other more subtle issues, in some cases the ones that are most significant, as clients trust. When we face an organization where the business process are less depending from machinery and heavily rely on human relationships, this problem is even more relevant, being real estate business one such good example. Additionally, if we consider the increase time needed to sell propriety after recent subprime worldwide crisis, sometimes the broker who initiates the process is not the one who finalizes it. It's easy to retain in the organization information about activities we performed (what, when... which we main collectively consider as explicit knowledge). In other way, we can't say the same about the way those activities are performed (how, that can consider more of tacit knowledge). To solve this situation, organizations must promote ways to retain tacit knowledge, in a way that it can be stored and disseminated through the organization. This paper discusses such issues taking into consideration real estate professionals, forms of action against this phenomenon. Assess the contribution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), formulating a conceptual model for the capture and transfer knowledge, using Grounded Theory to inform the model.
