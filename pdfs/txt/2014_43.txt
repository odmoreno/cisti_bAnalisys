Intelligent system for valorizing solid urban waste
ABSTRACT
The management of municipal solid waste is a complex problem for most developed countries. At present, only a few small cities have implemented procedures for collecting garbage in an innovative way. Thus, it is urgent to implement measures that initiate sustainable behavior, with the active participation of citizens, ensuring the conservation of resources through the reduction and recovery of waste. This paper describes the iEcoSys system (Intelligent Ecologic System) developed by the authors. It is a technological tool that identifies the waste produced individually, using RFID tags embedded in rubbish bags - the iBags. When depositing waste, the recycling center identifies and weighs each bag and the collected data is sent to a server system using ZigBee communication standard. When the information reaches the server system, it is inserted into the database management system, making it possible to see the deposited waste in the iEcoSys Internet portal, and even order new iBags. Making the cities smarter and promote sustainability by changing the paradigm of receiving the recycled rubbish instead of paying for the waste produced, is the contribution of this study.
