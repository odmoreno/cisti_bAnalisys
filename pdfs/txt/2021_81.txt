Refining the Acceasy Framework from an accessibility assessment
ABSTRACT
Online applications and services are increasingly present in peopleâ€™s routine, so giving attention to accessibility has become essential for reducing barriers in accessing these web interfaces. Thus, with the intention of facilitating the creation of accessible web pages that include accessibility guidelines, frameworks were developed, such as Acceasy, which help in the construction of these applications. Thus, this work aims to improve the Acceasy framework from an accessibility assessment for the visually impaired on a website created with the help of this framework. The accessibility tests carried out after the improvements implemented in the framework showed that it is possible to generate accessible HTML content for people with visual impairments with the help of Acceasy.
