Business intelligence applied to monitoring and meta-monitoring scenarios
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the use of the Business Intelligence process and some of its technologies to perform monitoring and meta-monitoring actions on sensed data and physical components that compose an environmental monitoring platform. These actions are mainly related to the capture of data that are the input to carry out the support of the decision-making process in the regulation and control of environmental pollution, the definition of policies, and the application of preventive and corrective actions to keep the monitoring physical infrastructure operational. For application development, they were used three tools of the Pentaho Suite. Kettle for carrying out the Extraction, Transformation and Load (ETL) process of data stored using the relational model (MySQL), and the no relational (MongoDB) paradigm, Worbench for modelling the On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes that operate over the data warehouse created from the monitoring operational data, and BI Server tool for publishing the defined cubes. Finally, we obtain as result a tool with a user friendly interface, and with capacities to filter and generate automatically summary tables and statistical graphics, based on the data of an environmental monitoring physical infrastructure.
