Methodology for construction of data migration processes in the context of developing systems
ABSTRACT
This work proposes a methodology specially designed to build maintain and implement in an efficient way, data migrations that occur in the context of the development of a new information system. Sometimes a new system requires to start up the incorporation of data inherited from those it replaces, this gives rise to a migration project that occurs in parallel to the development of the system. The particular aspect of this environment is the appearance of frequent changes in the new database as a consequence of the evolution in the construction of the system, which forces to adapt the migration. You get a process with the complexities of a migration, but in an unstable environment. In response, this paper defines a physical architecture that separates syntactic and semantic transformations and a methodology that delineates two iterative processes that make it possible to implement frequent changes in the destination base in a precise and orderly manner.
