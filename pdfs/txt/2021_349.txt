A Blockchain-based platform for reliably tracing political contacts
ABSTRACT
Corruption is an evil that affects not only the most oppressive and totalitarian regimes, but also, albeit to a lesser extent, democratic regimes. The difference largely consists in the mechanisms for combating corruption and in the transparency between political relations and other economic interests. The transparency associated with the possibility of tracking "interests" is one of the mechanisms that can be implemented in democracy. This article, after a brief overview about how the transparency of political relations can guarantee less corruption, presents a blockchain-based platform for tracking political contacts. All the concepts involved in the platform and its development are covered in detail, and several examples are presented. The proposed platform excels in data consistency, security and immutability, demonstrating enormous reliability and transparency towards users.
