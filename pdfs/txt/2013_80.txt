Pedestrian flow: A proposal for a cognitive multi-agent architecture
ABSTRACT
The increased access of information enables a greater awareness of people with environmental and social problems, which leads to perform daily activities with less effort that requires a greater demand on the condition of the pedestrian locomotion. Planning, engineering, operation, maintenance and development of the public places are critical elements in the improvement of the people locomotion. Therefore, the detailed study of the pedestrian flow is required. The cognitive multi-agent simulation with the cellular automata is an excellent technique in the analysis of flow and the pedestrian behaviors. Thus, it is possible to model and understand the processes related to the social interactions. For example, coordination, cooperation, formation by collisions and groups, evolution of conventions, intentionality, free will, among others.
