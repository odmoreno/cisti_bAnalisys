A custom Internet of Things healthcare system
ABSTRACT
Health is the fundamental capability humans require to perceive, feel, and act effectively, and as such, it represents a primary element in the development of the individual, but also of the environment humans belongs to. That is why it is necessary to provide adequate ways and means to ensure the appropriate healthcare delivery based on parameters monitoring and direct providing of the medical assistance. The new technologies development and implementation, especially the Internet and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) commonly known as the Internet of Things (IoT), enable global approach to the health care system infrastructure development. This leads to e-health system that, in real time manner, supplies a valuable set of information relevant to all of the stakeholders (patients, medical and paramedical stuff, and health insurance) regardless their current location. Commercial systems in this area usually do not meet the general patient needs, and those that do are usually economically unacceptable due to the high operational and development costs. In this paper, based on well-known low-cost technologies, there is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solution for a sustainable and adaptable patient oriented infrastructure development, presented.
