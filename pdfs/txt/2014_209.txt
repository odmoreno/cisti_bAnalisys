Assessing a nanothings system to monitor endocrine diseases automatously
ABSTRACT
Nano-communications have tremendous potential for applications in the biomedical, environmental, industrial and military fields. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm which allows nanomachines to exchange information using molecules as carrier. This is the most promising communication method within nanonetworks, since using electromagnetic waves is not very likely due to the size of the nanomachines. In molecular communication, information is encoded onto molecules at senders and the molecules propagate to receivers in a controlled manner. This control is one of the most important challenges, and this paper will describe some solutions for molecular communication. Since molecular communication offers means to transport information-encoded molecules to receivers and allows biological and artificially-created components to communicate with each other, future applications for health care are discussed in this paper. Results are obtained from computerized simulation scenarios selecting appropriate parameters for optimal performance.
