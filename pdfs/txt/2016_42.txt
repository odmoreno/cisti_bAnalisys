Emergency plans support systems: Integration of safety and security operational procedures
ABSTRACT
IBM IOC (Intelligent Operations Center) is a high potential computational platform with an exponential growth margin, that can be applied in many areas dealing with efficiency and smarter city development, by assisting its daily needs, along with the organization of large scale Festivities. In this work we present the application of this platform to Festa dos Tabuleiros (Trays Festival), which takes place every four years in the historic area of the city of Tomar, facing a number of challenges for the concerned authorities, addressing a set of needs raised by visitor safety and security issues. The resulting system, built around IOC, provides the authorities and general public a single powerful tool with direct impact on the management of the Festival.
