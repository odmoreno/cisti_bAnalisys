Towards a Blockchain-based Traceability Platform for the Fruit and Vegetables Value Chain
ABSTRACT
Consumers are increasingly aware of issues related to food safety and fraud, as well as environmental and ecological impacts due to food production. Besides the quality of the products, there is currently also a growing concern about the origin of the products and the path they take to reach the final consumers. Consumers are demanding transparency across the entire value chain of the products they consume. That’s why it’s necessary to design and develop traceability platforms for these products. The platform must be able to collect information at all stages of the supply chain and store it in a system external and shared by all operators in the value chain. This information must be available to all participants in the supply chain, including farmers, health authorities, government industries, sellers, retailer, final consumers, and any other actor involved in the value chain. This article describes the planning and implementation of a platform that allows to trace back and forth fruits and vegetables. This platform would be decentralized by using a blockchain-based approach. The proposed platform would provide an easy way to visualize information about products to any participant in this supply chain.
