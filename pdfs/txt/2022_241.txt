Business Intelligence in the Public Sector : The technological course of a "forgotten" sector
ABSTRACT
In recent years, Government concern, in the implementation of BI projects in the PA. In a slow and tedious "fight" for more than 30 years, the digital race, may represent a long journey in the eyes of its users. Before such mentality, the concern and exponential government interest in the last 10 years of demystifying this thought. Thus, there have been many implementations of innovative projects to improve services in the service of its users (TA data dictionary; BIORC Budget Business Intelligence (Directorate General for Budget), SIGNAL project, the Municipal Transparency Portal (DGAL) and of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s)). However, faced with a massification, redundancy, data processing, and a constant turnover in the heads and directors of the AP, can we really affirm a possible change in the "old-fashioned" technological paradigm? Can the "established" social mentality of the technological stagnation disappear? We experience that the AP has a more troubled and mountainous path compared to the common company. Its structure, the difficult change of mentalities, whether in the leadership or socially, makes the governmental objective difficult on a larger scale. It will be necessary to root out that the comparison is unequal. We must threat the same what is the same and different what is different.
