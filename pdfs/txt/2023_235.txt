Optimizing HVDC Maintenance and Training through Virtual and Augmented Reality: A Methodology Proposal
ABSTRACT
The importance of High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems is growing due to the rising trends of digitalization, decarbonization, and distributed generation in the energy industry. These systems provide an efficient means of transmitting large amounts of power over long distances, while also connecting renewable energy sources to the power grid and balancing three-phase grids. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies present a range of opportunities to address challenges in the energy industry. In this study, we propose a methodology to implement a VR and AR system for the energy electric company Eletronorte that facilitates visualization, navigation, and interaction with the arrangements and components of the HVDC system substations. The project involves developing modeling techniques to improve the representation of the components, updating preventive maintenance procedures, and creating a system monitoring environment using VR and AR, enabling engineering teams to interact with field teams and integrate real and virtual systems. VR simulations will provide a safe and controlled environment for training and testing, while AR simulations can be used to provide real-time guidance to technicians in the field. This approach can improve the efficiency and dependability of step-by-step activities, while also reducing the time and costs associated with system maintenance.
