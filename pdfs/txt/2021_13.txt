Capacid@de Digital: Tâmega e Sousa Volunteer Network for Digital Training
ABSTRACT
We are living in a digital age, which is characterized by an accelerated technological transformation. In this context, digital inequalities, which are often caused by the population's lack of technological knowledge, are increasingly accentuated and consequently, there is a growing need for training and digital inclusion of the population. This paper presents the initiative Capacid@de Digital: Tâmega e Sousa Volunteer Network for Digital Training, proposed by School of Management and Technology of the Polytechnic of Porto. This initiative aims to digitally train the active and non-active population of Tâmega and Sousa region, providing them digital skills that allow the execution of digital tasks necessary for the daily life of any citizen. In addition, the methodology used as basis for structuring this project is described.
