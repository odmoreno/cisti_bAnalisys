Human Capital and Technology in Latin American Growth
ABSTRACT
The research shows the relationship between Human Capital and Technology (using mobile phone subscriptions as a proxy variable) in Latin American growth (Gross Domestic Product at constant prices). To show this relationship, information was used from 13 Latin American countries, divided by income, in the period from 1980 to 2017. The results show a positive and significant relationship between human capital and technology for economic growth for the region and for countries high and low income. For middle-income countries, the results were not significant. Finally, it is recommended that the policies established by governments, in addition to seeking financing and investment mechanisms in Human Capital and Technology, should also guarantee the conditions so that at the internal level of each country, these investments can be used equitably.
