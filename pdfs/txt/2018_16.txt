MOOC platforms evaluation models
ABSTRACT
In this research, we present a platform evaluation model that houses MOOC courses (Massive Online Open Courses) which in Spanish means “Cursos Online Masivos y Abiertos”. First of all, we made a documentary research of MOOC platforms and evaluation methods already available to evaluate and select the best platform for each institution that produces MOOC. After searching, we couldn't find an evaluation system to do this specific job, thus, we decided to make a new one based on data found in the research, where we extracted capabilities of MOOC platforms, adding other features of Virtual Learning Environments (EVA in Spanish). In this way we got an evaluation rubric which was validated by experts in the management of MOOC platforms.
