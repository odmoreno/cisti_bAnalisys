Physical access control: A case study in a military institution of the Brazil
ABSTRACT
This case study assesses the differences between the control of physical access to a military institution, specifically in their offices located in different regions of Brazil, one located in the state A and the other in the state B. The study analyzes the institution from the point of view of physical access control, areas and facilities, guard duty, and information. The lack of standardization in physical access control methods is noted and research is carried out to determine the factors that lead to this situation. In addition to the analysis carried out in this paper, measures are proposed to turn the physical access control into an efficient system throughout the military institution.
