“Old Click” Prototype: Personalization and Accessibility to Learn Photography
ABSTRACT
The number of elderly people in Brazil has increased significantly in recent years. The process of aging of the population can generate important challenges for the public administration and the quality of life of the elderly. A tool was proposed for the elderly public that flee from the care themes, physical activity, social interaction, drug use and cognitive stimulation, a learning object about photography was proposed, which is described in this article. The methodology used was Design Science Research. The learning object has a social network and it is believed that its inclusion may be a differential factor for its acceptance and use by the elderly public. It is hoped that the presented tool can contribute to the debate on the subject, as well as to enable the creation of learning objects that are attractive and accessible to this public.
