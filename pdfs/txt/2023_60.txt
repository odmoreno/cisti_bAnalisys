Towards a Digital Platform for Goal-oriented and Competence-based Bundling of Volunteering
ABSTRACT
Voluntary commitment of citizens is an indispensable, supporting pillar of critical infrastructures (CRITIS) such as disaster management, rescue, health and social services or food supply. Sustainability of the voluntary sector, however, is massively endangered by profound changes in demography, social structure and volunteer motives in the sense of individualization and pluralization of society. This paper tackles these key challenges by proposing a digital platform for goal-driven and competence-based networking and bundling of volunteer engagement across NPOs. This platform is intended to be a first step in synergistically aligning the partly collaborative goals and competencies of volunteers with activity requirements for strengthening CRITIS.
