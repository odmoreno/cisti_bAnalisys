We are going on adventures! Gamifying a unit with Moodle
ABSTRACT
This article explains how a gamification experience of the practical part of a computer engineering degree course has been carried out, using Moodle, in order to motivate students and build loyalty. These practices became adventures to live, with challenges and levels to overcome, previously going through a training stage. The groups were squads, the tutorials were appointments with the Oracle. Students could see their completion level of the course and be aware of their progress thanks to the completion tracking. There were also surprise elements and statements that appeared automatically when some tasks were completed. Points were accumulated, the leaderboard was shown and badges were awarded. In addition, students were encouraged to add value to the subject and give recognition to their colleagues through a collaborative social forum. All these elements of the virtual classroom were complemented by welcoming the students in each face-to-face session with a variety of soundtracks from different action films to provoke an attitude of improvement and achievement.
