Digital games in Catalan classrooms: Teacher's point of view (2)
ABSTRACT
This paper explains the work that we have been doing since 2012 and related with what primary school teachers think about digital games in Catalan classrooms. The main objective is to discover and understand why teachers in general are not using it. While there is increasing research documenting the progress and outcomes of game-based learning and serious games, relatively little attention is paid to the real use of digital games in classrooms and the teachers perceptions. Depth interviews has been done with primary school teachers in order to have attitudes and teachers point of view. As a results of our work we present several teacher barriers to digital game use, for example, an absence of tecnics and generic tools for assessment “in” and “around” digital games.
