Corporate Social Responsibility in the management of the public sector in Ecuador Case study: Autonomous Government of Azuay
ABSTRACT
Social Responsibility is an emerging factor in the management of all organizations, not least in the public sector, in which the effective use of resources must be harmonized in search of better living conditions for the most vulnerable groups. In this context, this bibliographical research has been carried out, with the aim of commenting on the incidence of socially responsible practices in the management of autonomous governments, in this case that of the province of Azuay, located in the southern part of Ecuador.. The management of this government institution, always based on a true social conscience, has resulted in the fact that it is worthy of recognition for its direct relationship with interest groups on economic, social and especially environmental issues.
