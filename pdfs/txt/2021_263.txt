Increasing process maturity through a Business Process Management System : Case study at a financial institution
ABSTRACT
The division of functional areas by themes and business processes is one of the most complex factors for financial institutions due to the logistics associated with the processing of information between teams, areas and departments. It is extremely relevant for organizational management that this flow can be managed efficiently and effectively. It was considered pertinent study the impact that an implementation of a business process management system (BPMS) has in terms of increasing the processes maturity. For this investigation, it is important to use a model that allows establishing evaluation requirements and, with all its recognition, the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) affirmed itself as the ideal choice to assess which practices the organization implements and how is there a distinction between the system that involves the exchange of e-mail messages and the BPMS. The results obtained by comparing both tools (email and BPMS) corroborate the advantages of implementing the process-oriented solution since its users, who previously used email, identify that it promotes growth in terms of processes through the practices. Combined with an organizational culture receptive to this type of technology, BPMS presents a varied range of benefits compared to the option previously used at the institution under study.
