Performance Evaluation of a Physiological and Environmental Signals Measuring System in Real Time
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the performance evaluation of a physiological and environmental signals measuring system, by analyzing the delay and the packet loss. Our work uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) in order to receive the signals in real time, which are stored in a database, and subsequently displayed on a Web page and mobile devices by using an application, which in case of an anomaly of both, the environmental and physiological signals, the system is able to launch an alert. The results obtained show that MQTT has a packet loss of approximately 3%, and a delay of around 295ms, while HTTP presented 7% and 275ms, respectively.
