Corporative Education Used to Attract and Qualify Workforce for the Software Industry
ABSTRACT
The lack of Software Development (DS) professionals triggers an alert that the area will collapse in the coming years. The academy cannot meet the industryâ€™s demand, increasing the deficit, and companies, in turn, seek alternatives to minimize the problem. This study investigates Corporate Education (CE) as a strategy for attracting and training labor in a DS company. Action research with a quali-quantitative approach was carried out, where opinion polls and meetings with focus groups were applied to evaluate the techniques used and the social effects of this project. Challenges were identified, such as time adequacy, content, workload, and leveling. In sequence, there were interventions to solve problems and insert improvements to the course. The results of this research allowed a positive evaluation of the applied teaching method, confirmed by the collection of testimonials and the presentation of high success rates, including hiring before the conclusion of the course. As a contribution, this study presents researchers and companies with an experience of attracting labor through EC that can help advance studies and projects that address this context.
