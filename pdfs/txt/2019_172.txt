Quantifying the usability of software is vital to the success of the organizations using information systems. Management systems deployed in the universities have the characteristic of having well defined user roles for which the management systems should be customized. In this field, this paper identifies a set of instruments being used for usability assessment and proposes its integration in a hybrid procedure for measuring the usability of higher education management systems. The evaluation takes place in the empiric, quantitative and qualitative dimesion. As validated instruments are used, this paper focuses on characterizing the results of the use of the proposed procedure in evaluating the usability of the integrated management system of the Universidad Técnica de Ambato In order to verify the proposal, it was used for measuring the usability of the integrated management system of Universidad Técnica de Ambato, a system with more than 25000 users. The resulting improvement plan was validated by the university's community of users, proving the acceptance of the proposal.
