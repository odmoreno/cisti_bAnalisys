Digital Marketing and Tourism : Case Study Applied to Barcelos
ABSTRACT
The use of digital marketing by tourism, has an increasing importance, since most of the time, it is through digital marketing that it is possible to obtain information about tourists or make them reach information. This studyâ€™s objective was to analyze the use of digital marketing in tourism in Barcelos city. Thus, we resorted to the case study, where the quantitative and qualitative approach were reconciled. In the study participated in 106 respondents and three interviewees, more precisely, two marketing and tourism professionals and one tourism academic. The qualitative perspective is this research focus. Since this study coincides with the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (COVID-19), it is possible to envisage the massive use of digital marketing by the tourism sector, as a tool to help overcome the existing difficulties. Furthermore, this study contributes to future research related to tourism in the Barcelos city and to digital marketing that can be transposed to organizations management, in order to foster discussion about processes of attraction, retention and loyalty of target audiences.
