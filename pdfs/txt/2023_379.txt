The power of education to change society : Methodologies, academic success and well-being at Higher Education
ABSTRACT
The implementation of a society 5.0 will be a reality in the near future. Within this new paradigm, Higher Education Institutions must adopt a mentality 5.0 and be prepared to create qualified professionals who are not only capable of coping with profound changes in society, but are also willing to change themselves. This paper aims to give a firsthand exploratory view on how a Portuguese University is preparing to face the next years, namely regarding three fundamental pillars: methodologies, academic success, and well-being.
