Used and interaction in technological platforms of open source to improve the linguistic competence in computer engineers
ABSTRACT
The higher education through virtual environment is students centered oriented to the interactive learning, in situations to be closer to the real world; for that reason, teachers must have new communicative competences, nonverbal and with a learning innovative approach which allows to guide their students in the complex process of acquiring knowledge even more in a foreign language. In the same context, the use of technologic platforms of open code is becoming in the best way to give solutions which meet the actual needs of the process of acquiring a second language; on this basis, the present research is focused in the analysis and use of Open Source tools as alternative of complementary material to improve the writing skill in the process of Foreign Language Acquisition (FLA). Furthermore, teachers should not consolidate in the online learning, but also in the interaction with the students as is stated by Gibson (1993); in that way, the new technologies should be media which help to decrease the digital gap giving fast solutions, answers within the learning-teaching process which is visible with the application of Open source technologies. Thus, through the use of Open Source tools was proposed to demonstrate if it is possible to improve the writing skill in the student who took the subject of technical writing for software engineers.
