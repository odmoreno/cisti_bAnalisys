Digital attitude in university teachers and emerging factors: a case study in the colombian context for the implementation of MOOC courses type
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research article is to make a contrast between the results obtained through the application and adaptation of a previously validated instrument on Digital Technologies and the use they make of them. The sample is equal to the population of the institution, the inclusion criterion corresponds to the total of teachers who participated, that is, 63, and those who did not want to participate were excluded. The implications of two emerging factors are analyzed through the principal component analysis method. The results obtained from the instrument and its contrast with the data of use of Digital Technologies allow to determine that the attitudes of teachers towards them are ”Muy Favorables”, which is contradictory with the instrumental use they make of them. These findings are taken as a baseline to undertake a future training process that favors the mobilization of processes that focus Digital Technologies towards learning, empowerment and participation.
