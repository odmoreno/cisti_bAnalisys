Innovation capacity vs. internationalization capacity : The case of Colombian manufacturing SMEs of the Atlantic region
ABSTRACT
Despite the Colombian government's efforts to promote non-traditional exports, the effects of the measures have not yet result in significant increase. Additionally, the access of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - which are predominant in the country - to international markets currently not significant. Previous studies suggest that there is a direct relationship between the degree of innovation and the degree of internationalization of organizations. In this scenario, this article aims to analyze this relationship based on a field study carried out in 224 small and medium-sized manufacturing companies located in the Atlantic region, in Colombia. The results show that the structuring and participation in research and development programs, access to information technology and the existence of standardized processes and products in the organization are elements that potentially increase competitiveness and contributes to access international markets. Therefore, the adoption of SME export promotion policies that focus on stimulating innovation can contribute to the growth of exports of non-traditional products by organizations of this size.
