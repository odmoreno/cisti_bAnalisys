European public media revise their strategy for the next decade
ABSTRACT
The agreement is the document that defines the general principles contained in the laws governing the operation of the European Union's public service media. It presents the editorial strategy of the service, although not its operational or organizational concretion, which is developed through the contracts. This is essentially because their chronological period is long enough, nine or ten years, to make any suitable strategic forecast unfeasible. This communication presents the guidelines governing the agreements approved in the last five years in European public broadcasting corporations, with the aim of knowing the horizons that the governing bodies are facing for the next decade.
