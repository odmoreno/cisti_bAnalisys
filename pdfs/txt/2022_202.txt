The use of social networks, usefulness and ease of use, enjoyment through positive emotions and their influence on school satisfaction mediated by school achievement
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between the use of social networks, usefulness and ease of use, enjoyment through positive emotions and their influence on school satisfaction mediated by school achievement. The investigation was carried out in a state of social isolation due to the presence of Covid-19. The sample for the study consisted of 108 students from the 3rd to the 5th year of studies at the secondary education level of a public educational institution in the Arequipa region in Peru. The methodology that was used had two well-defined phases, firstly, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was carried out, this analysis had the objective of condensing the information in original variables to smaller series, secondly, an Analysis Confirmatory Factorial (AFC), through the modelling of structural equations based on variances, called PLS-SEM. It is concluded that the proposed structural model, which uses school achievement as a mediation variable, is explained from its variance in 81.6%, and the factorial load it exerts on the dependent variable such as school satisfaction is significant and decisive.
