Web application for the training of the correct pronunciation of words in Portuguese for people with speech and language disorders â€” preliminary usability study
ABSTRACT
In this paper, a Web application that allows people with speech impairments to train and amend pronunciation of words by repeating words presented in a interface with visual and auditory stimuli, is presented. With this app, we aim at present a training assistive tool to be used by the user, in a daily situation, where the main asset is the feedback about the rate of correct pronunciation, thus allowing users to train, autonomously, at home. Additionally, we present a preliminary user study to assess usability of the proposed application. For that, we invited a group of people with speech impairments to perform training tasks with the application. In the assessment, we register the following parameters: effectiveness (successful conclusion of the training tasks and percentage of pronouncing success); efficiency (number of errors made, number and type of difficulties found); and, satisfaction (the acceptance and comfort to complete the training tasks). Overall, the preliminary results showed that participants achieved an efficiency rate of 53.4% in the accomplishment of the proposed tasks. On average, for each image, participants missed at least 2 times, where the most registered difficulty was the pronunciation of words with accents. Regarding satisfaction, we noticed that they like it as they ask not only to repeat the test but also the addition of more pictures to perform more tests with the proposed web application.
