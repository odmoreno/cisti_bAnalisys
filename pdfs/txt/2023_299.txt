Coverage Area Estimation for Dark Kitchens: : A Queueing Theory Approach
ABSTRACT
Understanding the management of the enterprise dark kitchens model represents a strategic step that contributes significantly to its performance in terms of costs incurred and responsiveness, dimensions related to location, facilities, flow allocation, transportation, inventory management, and warehousing. Among the wide range of problems raised, the problem of location has been considered, notably because of its critical role in the strategic planning of public and private companies. This paper aims to propose an optimized cover service model for dark kitchens. The results support the importance of modeling optimal logistics planning within cities, from establishment setup, inbound and outbound flows, production time, and the queuing process in the system. Due to its applicability and importance within the topic of marketing strategies to increase the competitive advantage of organizations, a theoretical gap exists as there are no known previous studies in the literature that seeks to identify the maximum coverage radius explicitly related to the implementation and performance of dark kitchens within an M/M/m queuing system.
