MEstiAM: Estimation model for mobile applications
ABSTRACT
The rise of the use of mobile technologies in the world, such as smartphones and tablets, connected to mobile networks, is changing old habits and creating new ways of society to access information and interact with computer systems. Thus, the traditional information systems are undergoing a process of adaptation to this new computing environment. However, it is important to note that the characteristics of this new context are different. In it there are new features and consequently new possibilities as well as not existing before restrictions. Finally, the systems developed for this environment has different requirements and characteristics of the traditional information systems. For this reason, there is a need to reassess the current knowledge about the processes of planning and construction for the development of systems in this new environment. One area in particular that demand such adaptation is the estimation software. The estimation processes, in general, are based on characteristics of the systems, trying to quantify the complexity of implementing them. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to present an estimation model for mobile applications.
