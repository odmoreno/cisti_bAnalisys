Public and City Marketing Applied to Improve Participatory Processes in Socio-Economic Paradigm Shifts: Energy Transition. A case study
ABSTRACT
The complex and uncertain situation generated by socio-economic paradigm shifts, as is the case of the energy and ecological transition initiated in Spain, requires participatory processes of the population. The aim is for the residents of the affected territories to become appropriately and responsibly involved in the process of change, which requires, beforehand, the resolution of situations of asymmetric and incomplete information. As a management process, Public and City Marketing offers several ways to effectively solve challenges, such as benchmarking and social communication.
