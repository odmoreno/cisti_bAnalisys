Contribution of Industry 4.0 Technologies to Social Responsibility and Sustainability
ABSTRACT
Facing an era of immense global challenges, challenging, uncertainties and changes, organizations have sought to reconcile the responsibility of promoting solutions that meet the needs of a population, without compromising the resources for future generations, with the use of New Information and Communication Technologies, such as those of Industry 4.0. Thus, Social Responsibility practices have incited several debates, especially when related to the use of New Information and Communication Technologies enhancing and promoting sustainability practices in industry.In this sense, we propose, through a literature review, to analyze the state of the art of the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies in promoting Social Responsibility and its contribution to the improvement of sustainability actions and practices.Industry 4.0 should be seen as an opportunity to advance sustainable development and its performance, not as a threat to society and the quality of life of the current generation and future generations.We will contribute to the reflection on the potential and implications of new technologies in the dissemination of Social Responsibility and sustainability practices.
