Accessible Features to Support Visually Impaired People in Game Development: : A Systematic Literature Review of the last 15 years
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a systematic review of the literature to investigate best practices for developing digital games for people with visual impairments. The execution of the search protocol that focused on papers published between 2004 and 2019, 17 papers were obtained from two online databases. The selected papers present information about the application of accessibility features that were tested in a minimum viable product applied to people with visual impairments. As a result, it was found that most papers focus on navigation systems, which is a feature used in most digital games, and all of them make use of sound effects. In most of the researched papers, audio is the main instrument to assist the visually impaired player. The development features presented in the systematic review can serve as a basis for developers in the field. Finally, there is still little content in the literature on accessible features available in the context of digital games, which makes it an indispensable research field to explore.
