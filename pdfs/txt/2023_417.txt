BIM-FM process exploration in Augmented Reality : A case study of power transformer in power substation
ABSTRACT
The application of BIM for ease of operation and maintenance is an emerging area, especially when the focus is on energy management. The use of BIM as a database and systems with the ability to visualize them is the main point addressed in BIM-O&M research. However, challenges with interoperability, the definition of requirements for O & M, and a feasibility analysis of BIM implementation costs in this phase have fewer scientific investigations. This research explores alternatives to the obstacles of loco manipulation of BIM models in Electrical Engineering through a case study of an electromechanical device in an electric power substation.
