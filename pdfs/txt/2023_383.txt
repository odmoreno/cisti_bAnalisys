Economic Performance of Apparel Manufacturing Companies
ABSTRACT
Given the relevance of the textile industry, over the years, for the portuguese economy, we intend to evaluate the economic performance of companies belonging to CAE 14131 through the indicators ROA, ROE, ROS and EVA/employees. Through the DEA technique, the BoD model is used to aggregate the various indicators in order to determine the composite indicator of 5.397 companies observed over the years 2011 to 2020, in order to deepen the knowledge about the Portuguese business economic textile sector. Through data analysis there is a progressive improvement of the indicators studied over the years which can be explained by the technological evolution occurred in this industry, although the sector under study uses mostly intensive labour. In each year, the efficient frontier is defined mostly by micro and small enterprises, which are predominantly located in the North of Portugal.
