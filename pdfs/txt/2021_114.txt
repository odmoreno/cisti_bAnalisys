Data Warehouse Based on NoSQL: a literature mapping
ABSTRACT
The Data Warehouse context is in transformation in private and public organizations. New proposals for managing large volumes of data have been defined in the literature, such as the storage and analysis of data by non-relational DBMS, or NoSQL (Not-only SQL) Databases, under a Big Data scenario. Thus, Data Warehouses, which originally relied on relational databases, have been using NoSQL databases to analyze this massive data in recent years. Besides, there is the rise of hybrid transactional and analytical processing, in real-time, known as HTAP, which provides simplicity and quick support to decision making. In this context, this article has the objective to accomplish a literature mapping of DW based on NoSQL databases and advances in HTAP. A methodology for a systematic literature search protocol was used to answer the research questions. We found 72 papers in the last five years, which we analyzed in this paper.
