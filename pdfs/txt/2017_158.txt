Modelling the performance of adaptive multi-boiler heating system
ABSTRACT
In up-to-date conditions information technology is frequently associated with the modelling process, using computer technology as well as information networks. The simulation model can be used for complex problems (with many related values) in order to conduct advanced research. This article describes the method of assessing the economic efficiency modelling of a multi-boiler adaptive heating system in real-time systems which allows for dynamic change in the operation scenarios of system service installations while enhancing the economic efficiency of the system in consideration.
