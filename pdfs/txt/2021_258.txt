Robotic Process Automation implementation framework in a financial institution
ABSTRACT
In recent years, the financial sector has undergone profound changes at a global level. These changes have acted as incentives, forcing financial institutions to reassess their strategic plans in a context of promoting operational excellence and improving the quality of services provided. In this context, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has been in high demand by organizations that aspire to restructure their operations in the context of digital transformation projects. This article aims to provide a literature review on the subject under study and, later, to propose a first initiative of a framework that allows evaluating the key factors for a successful implementation of RPA technology, at the level of three dimensions of analysis, management, organization and technology. Additionally, it should be emphasized that it is not the objective of this article to define the final dimensions necessary for an implementation, but rather to propose a starting point for that same exploration.
