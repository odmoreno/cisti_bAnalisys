Ethics of Artificial Intelligence: Challenges
ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) has in recent times assumed a relevant role in the most diverse sectors of our society. We are at a no return point, and our future will incorporate artificial intelligence into our everyday life, professional or personal. The idea of “thinking” machines existence, making decisions by Humans raises several ethical questions. It is fundamental to study and investigate the best approaches to their integration. This article identifies the guiding principles of ethics in the context of using intelligent and autonomous systems. Here we present a bibliometric study, reporting the main ACM and IEEE studies on Ethics and AI. Our results indicate various clusters of Ethics and AI, that the scientific community has been focused on.
