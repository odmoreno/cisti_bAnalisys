A Delphi proposal as a starting point for building a system of indicator for corporate communication agents
ABSTRACT
The new digital context poses new challenges for corporate communication agents. In this new context, the availability of reliable information systems for decisions-makers is of particular importance; this is precisely the main objective of the RTV2025 project: the identification, selection and construction synthetic indicators on governance, financing, accountability, innovation, quality and value of the audio-visual public services. The Delphi method is one of the most used techniques to obtain and aggregate expert valuation on a complex issue; in our case, the Delphi will gather the opinion of a group of experts about the suitability of a list of partial indicators that will later serve as the basis for the synthetic indexes. Our specific Delphi proposal is structured in several stages: making an initial list of plausible individual indicators, designing of the questionnaires, selection of the panel of experts, first round of questionnaires, statistical analyse of the responses, second round of questionnaires.
