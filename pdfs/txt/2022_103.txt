Radiology Information System (RIS)
ABSTRACT
Medical exams, particularly those involving ultrasound images, should always be performed with the complete set of information. However, when administrative staff schedule an exam, at the Cova da Beira University Hospital Center, in the Department of Children's and Women's Health, Gynecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics, not always information flows to medical staff in an efficient mode. Radiology Information System (RIS), systems that support this information flows, some-times are unavailable or too expensive. As a first approach, research at the public contracts database portal was conducted, but few references were found, and none referred to the use of open-source technologies. To fill up this gap, a systematic review from a technical perspective has been con-ducted, based on the PRISMA guidelines, under the topics associated with "RIS", "DICOM", "HL7", "OPEN SOURCE" and "RADIOLOGY", in the databases PubMed Central, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital. After applying several exclusion criteria, fourteen articles were included for careful con-sideration. These studies address some consistent positive evidence on the efficacy of using open-source technologies associated with DICOM and HL7 protocols to support a RIS implementation.
