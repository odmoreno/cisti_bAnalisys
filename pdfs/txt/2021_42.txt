Monitoring the business process using dashboards : The case study of an organisation from the research and innovation system
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the work developed and the knowledge acquired from the implementation of a dashboard in a research and innovation system organization, CTCV. The research presents the motivations that led to the implementation of tools that allow the organization to obtain information from the data it produces daily. The achievement of that objective included the creation of key performance indicators (Key Performance Indicators, KPI) and the development of an analytical model, with a view to implementing these indicators in a dashboard, elaborated using Microsoft's Business Intelligence tool, the Power BI. As a result, the proposed solution is explored, as a management and decision support system, at the operational and strategic level, which allows CTCV decision makers to access relevant information in real time and in a dynamic and interactive way. The study also reveals the opportunity to apply the developed indicators to other organizations.
