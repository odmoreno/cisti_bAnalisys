Intelligent system for recycling incentive
ABSTRACT
Cities are facing an increasing growth in population, resulting in, among other things, increasing quantities of waste being generated. Industrialization and economic growth has produced more amounts of waste, including hazardous and toxic wastes. Thus, every year, millions of tonnes of litter end up in municipal or industrial waste dumps, oceans, beaches, forests and elsewhere in nature. This paper presented an intelligent system of recycling incentive (iEcosys). The study is divided into two fronts. On the first part, an empirical study, which demonstrates the usefulness of the iEcosys system, based on a questionnaire survey, will be presented. The second part will describe the iEcoSys system developed by the authors. It is a technological tool that identifies the waste produced individually, using RFID tags embedded in rubbish bags - the iBags. Making the cities smarter and promote sustainability by changing the paradigm of receiving the recycled rubbish instead of paying for the waste produced, is the contribution of this study.
