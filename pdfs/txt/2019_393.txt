ICT Exports and Environmental Degradation: The Case of South America
ABSTRACT
Considering the role of ICT (Information and Telecommunication Technologies) on the economic growth of developing countries, the constant discussion of climate change and environmental degradation and considering the increase in trade worldwide, as a result of the accelerated processes of globalization, the objective of the article is to identify the effect of ICT exports on variables that measure environmental damage. For this purpose, we use panel data models for South American countries, period 2000-2016. The results describe the quadratic relationship that environmental degradation has with ICT exports, thus verifying the hypothesis of the Kuznets curve.
