Skin temperature classification by Image Processing
ABSTRACT
Currently, body map temperature is one of the most commonly used indicators of human health status. The use of portable thermal camera equipment for temperature measurements in the human skin is nowadays a reality. This work aims to present an automatic method to skin temperature classification using image processing, investigating the potential role of temperature changes in skin inflammation. Infrared thermography (IRT) was used to assess the thermogenic response of the hand skin. Characteristics of the map temperature distribution in some anatomical regions of the hand were collected. The tests were realized to demonstrate the potential of using image processing to identify and define specific regions of temperatures and their characteristics. The thermal information provided by these imaging systems can be used for monitoring purposes, as some previous research demonstrated. However, to develop more accurate algorithms, larger training and testing sets must be used.
