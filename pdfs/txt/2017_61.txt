Risk reliability analysis, resulting from explosions in petrochemical industries: A case study using Aloha software
ABSTRACT
It is common in the world the existence of explosion risks linked to the oil refining process. Thus, to analyze the probable situations, it is necessary the intervention of the technology through the systems of virtual reality and simulations. The explosion, is the type of increased accident that most causes immediate deaths, leading companies to pay damages and rebuild their destroyed assets again. So, the objective of this work is to demonstrate the use of software simulations to identify and quantify the possible effects of physical effects and explosion damages, resulting from the Petroleum Refining process operation of the diesel hydrotreatment unit, Abreu e Lima Refinery (ALR or RNEST in Brazil, country of Latin-American), a city located in northeastern Brazil. Simulations were performed with the Aloha software in three pipes of the ALR. The analyzes allowed to identify two routes of the refinery that present moderate threats, with effects that have the capacity to generate ruptures in the tympani and pulmonary hemorrhages in their employees. Finally, proposals were made for preventive mitigation measures to ensure that petrochemicals reduce their costs and still maintain the safety of their employees.
