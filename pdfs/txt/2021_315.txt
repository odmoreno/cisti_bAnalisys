A Meta-Learning Approach to Error Prediction
ABSTRACT
Machine Learning is one of the most trending topics nowadays. The reason is of course for being more and more present in our everyday life, even if we do not notice it. What goes even more unnoticed is the fact that every Machine Learning model needs computational power. And of course, it also needs data. But how many data are necessary to build the best Machine Learning model possible, and how many times do we need to retrain a model so that it does not become obsolete as data change? That kind of questions are the ones that can reduce unnecessary costs to a company. In this paper we propose a novel approach to predict the performance of a model given some characteristics of the data, that are called meta-features. The goal is, indeed, to only train a new model when some error metric (e.g., RMSE) is expected to decrease substantially compared with a previously trained model. This approach is best applied in scenarios of data streaming or in Big Data, as well on Interactive Machine Learning scenarios. We validate it on a real Fraud Detection case and this scenario is also briefly described.
