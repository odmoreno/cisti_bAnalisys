Teaching software project management by using Lego Mindstorm robot
ABSTRACT
This paper reports an experience on using the robot Lego Mindstorm NXT 2.0, model 8547, to support the teaching of Software Project Management. We conducted an experiment in which two teams developed a software project using the robot, while applying principles of project management. The experiment was divided into two parts. First, we verified the existence of related project management techniques. Second, we mapped the results obtained by the project in order to verify whether the project management had impacted on the results, as expected. We conclude that the Lego robot is a motivational factor for the students and can be adopted as a learning object in the teaching of Software Project Management.
