Contribution to food security, with the implementation of family gardens, supported by communication tools Paper Title in English : Comunicar la Innovaci√≥n Social
ABSTRACT
The implementation of home gardens contributes to promote a favorable diet, with economically viable resources that guarantee adequate food security. This research aims to present the linkage project implemented in Ecuador by the Loja Food Bank and the UTPL, an initiative that brought together families to take advantage of the spaces in their homes and start the construction of family gardens. The training, intervention and monitoring of the families was developed, to a large extent, with the help of communication tools such as WhatsApp and Zoom. Among the results, 85,73% of the families know how to manage the gardens, in terms of fertilizer, irrigation and soil, and 85,37% indicated that their weekly economic expenses decreased significantly. It is concluded that the family or community gardens improve the food quality of the population.
