Reduction of complications generated by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus using a remote health care solution in Peru
ABSTRACT
In this article, we propose a technological architecture that supports the remote medical care service for elderly people suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Peru. The problem is based on the limitations that elderly people have with compliance with medical controls, which leads to increased complications of the disease and the patient's quality of life. The design of the technological architecture is based on 6 layers: 1) devices, 2) software, 3) channels, 4) data storage, 5) data processing and 6) information visualization. Through the solution, patients are able to autonomously manage their disease through periodic glucose control and the execution of an updated treatment in real time. In the same way, the specialist doctor periodically analyzes the glucose level and it is notified in real time about the out-of-range indicators, which allows him to make treatment decisions as the anomaly occurs. The focus of the solution is to reduce the complications generated by the disease through efficient glucose control and periodic medical advice. The solution was validated in a nursing home with adults over 60 and an endocrinologist from a medical office in Lima, Peru. For the study, we measured the constancy of the glucose record, the average response time of the doctor in case of emergencies or indicators out of range, the percentage of reduction of complications and the level of satisfaction of the Telehomecare solution in older adults. The results show that patients interact more frequently as they adapt the solution as part of their daily routine. On the other hand, the response time was approximately 4.13 minutes from the anomaly record. The percentage of complication reduction was 14% and the level of satisfaction of the solution was reflected in the dimensions of the response time and understanding of the user's need.
