Interfaz BCIE (Brain Computer Interface Educational) en Rasberry Pi utilizando sensor neurosky
ABSTRACT
The design of educational information systems has increased today, presenting new ways of carrying out educational problems. This article shows the development of a Brain Computer Interface Educational (BCIE) system capable of capturing, configuring and displaying in real time through a graphical signal interface (EEG) obtained through the MindWave Mobile device from NeuroSky, which captures brain signals and later the shipments via bluetooth to the embedded Raspberry Pi 3B+ system. The system allows attention values to be obtained when the student interacts with different activities. As a result, it was possible to obtain an interface embedded in a portable controller that allows to determine the attention profiles of students at the educational level.
