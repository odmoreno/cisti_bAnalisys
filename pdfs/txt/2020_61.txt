Microservices mobility in datacenters supported by Software Defined Networking
ABSTRACT
The growing adoption of software architectures based on microservices, and consequently the proliferation of the use of containers in environments with hybrid infrastructures (local data centers and public cloud providers), poses several challenges in terms of integrating this new paradigm into already existing solutions. In this context, this article initially focuses on the challenges of integrating a container orchestration platform (Kubernetes) with existing solutions in the data center, namely: network infrastructure (Cisco ACI - Application Centric Infrastructure), load balancing (F5) and storage (NFS). In a second stage, this paper also addresses the issue of integration with orchestration platforms hosted in a public cloud (Microsoft Azure). This integration will allow the movement of containers from the local data center to the cloud without having to reconFigure the network infrastructure or the current security policy.
