Multimedia content in online advertising: insight into generation Z preferences
ABSTRACT
Online advertising has undergone a significant transformation in recent years and continues to evolve rapidly. This paper contributes to the research focusing on new trends that must be followed to target customer segment. Generation Z now represents 26 % of the global population, so experts in this field should be interested in their needs and desires. This paper contributes to this field by offering three views on generation Z regarding their perception of online advertisement â€“ their personal view, their professional opinion, and the relationship between those two views. We used an experimental setting during marketing classes with two separate questionnaires, one at the beginning of the semester and one at the end.
