E-commerce as an entry mode in foreign markets: A systemic approach to the assessment of opportunities
ABSTRACT
In today's competitive environment, where companies are searching for new and convenient ways to communicate and deliver their products and services to their consumers, ecommerce presents itself as an irrefutable decision as a means of access to international markets. However, for the internationalization done through this channel to result favorably, it is necessary this decision to be supported by a method of analysis to increase full understanding of firm's competitive landscape, as well as its internal competencies, before deciding the entry mode to use, which will be facilitated by the use of e-commerce. Based on a dynamic methodological design grounded on an action-research approach, an exploratory research in the industry of sports supplements was conducted, with the primary objective of designing a simplified model for the assessment of opportunities of internationalization through ecommerce.
