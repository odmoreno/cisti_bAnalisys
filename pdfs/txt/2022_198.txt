The processes of media literacy in older adults in the province of Loja
ABSTRACT
The use of ICTs raises concerns in society, and today it is necessary to develop media literacy programs. This study uses a mixed methodology, applying surveys to a sample of 150 older adults in the cantons of Calvas, Gonzanam√° and Quilanga in the province of Loja, Ecuador and interviews to experts on the subject, which allow contrasting the data obtained. The results show that there are no records of Media Literacy programs and that the population studied has had to be incorporated into the Information Society according to their needs. The processes of media literacy should be underpinned by the Internet and generated by the State and ONGs, to be used as instruments of inclusion in the possibility of improving the quality of life of older adults. It is concluded that the levels of media skills in Ecuador are relatively low; it is necessary to implement educational processes to combat the digital divide.
