V2G smart system: An intelligent system to the electric vehicle charging problem
ABSTRACT
The next big step in the evolution of the automotive industry is the introduction of electric vehicles (EV), however has associated limitations of autonomy and in conjunction with this limitation, extended charging times, very few points of charging and smart electricity grids very embryonic. In this context, is requires a very rigorous planning of daily use of the EV. Thus, this work presents an information system that aims to help the driver in the daily use of the EV in order to deal with the charging problem, minimizing the problem of anxiety to archive the objectives through the continuous monitoring of the autonomy of the vehicle and the timely submission of relevant information related to charging process, also allowing the storage the energy transactions for later analysis and further improvements. Similarly, given the limitations of the electrical distribution network and taking into account N simultaneous charging process a management system is proposed to deal with this problem, in order to limit the total power consumed in each moment.
