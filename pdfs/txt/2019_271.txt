Promotion of activities of tourist animation in the pages of Facebook of the municipalities of Terras de Trás-os-Montes
ABSTRACT
Touristic Animation is increasingly important in the tourism sector, both in hotel establishments and in municipalities. Therefore, it is imperative that the activities of tourist animation are available to tourists when occupying their leisure time. Today the internet is the most viable medium of communication, and consequently it is the most effective means of promotion. As Facebook is one of the most used social networks in the world for the promotion of tourism, it is extremely important that municipalities use it to promote their activities. Thus, the present investigation tried to understand if the municipalities belonging to the Lands of Trás-os-Montes promote in their Facebook page some type of activity of tourist animation. To do this, a survey was made of the publications of each municipality on Facebook in the period from 06/09/2017 until 06/09/2018. It was concluded that all municipalities promote tourism activities on their Facebook pages.
