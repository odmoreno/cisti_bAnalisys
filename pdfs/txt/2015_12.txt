Identification of the affinity in audiovisual advertising by using adaptive vector models
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, one of the main challenges in marketing is connecting consumers with brands, and of course with products. This connection could be possible when there are involved feelings, emotions and sensations of the consumer, to find them, there are techniques such as focus groups, projective methods or personal interviews, among other. Despite the progress of these techniques in recent years by psychologists and marketing professionals, there is still a clear absence of models that help to identify in real time the affinity, the interests and the preferences of consumers for a particular product or brand. In order to solve the above, three adaptive vector models are developed and analyzed, based on the principles of computational intelligence, to identify in real time the affinity of consumers for certain audiovisual advertising by recording their brain bioelectrical activity. The results obtained, reach levels of identification of affinity close to 80% on average, from the identification of its predisposition to short periods of time throughout the length of certain audiovisual advertising.
