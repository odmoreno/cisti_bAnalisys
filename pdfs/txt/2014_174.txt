Academic broadcasters: Interactions, collaborations and knowledge
ABSTRACT
A new social conscience is created, which will be used by an net society, at local and global levels, crossing both communication contexts, constituting a collaborative e interactive global network. In other sense, the geographical boundaries are diluted, the world today is interconnected by the simultaneity of the new information and communication technologies. Unlike conventional radio, Internet radio immediately sparked the interest of the broadcasting companies, once it did not impose limits on the listener's geographical range, nor on the exclusive audio format programming. These radios have not delayed in employing the technological resources of web radio, fact that can be sustained by the quantitative growth of online platforms, through which people can have access to the ordinary programming in real time by means of a great variety of devices connected to the Internet. This investigation considered it important to analyze the educational potentialities of web radios in the Spanish and Portuguese academic universe. For that purpose, given the characteristics of the study, the research methodology used was of qualitative and empirical-descriptive.
