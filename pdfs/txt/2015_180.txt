Challenges and opportunities for exploring patient-level data: Preliminary results
ABSTRACT
The exploration of clinical registries is the subject of many large-scale projects. The overarching goal behind existing initiatives is to uncover the full potential behind patient-level data, leading to a better understanding of diseases and treatments effectiveness. In this work we performed a review of well-known large-scale initiatives, strategies and projects where the exploration of patient-level data is an underlying goal. We setup an evaluation framework assessing, for each project, its technological and scientific outcomes, partners' features and other miscellaneous data-related topics. Our aim is to unveil ongoing challenges in this domain, exploring how we can transform them into opportunities for future developments. Only with this evolution we can continue moving forward towards personalised medicine.
