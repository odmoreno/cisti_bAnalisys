Fault-tolerant control of a helix-driven parallelogram pendulum
ABSTRACT
Control systems are a set of elements focused on regulating the behavior of the systems from an analysis treatment. There are different approaches to systems control. A lot of these focus on the use of intelligent control systems, unfortunately, need large training sets and guarantee slow response times. An alternative is to use the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm, due to considerably fast response times, in most cases, without considering disturbances. There are studies focused on angular position control systems on a rocker arm driven by propellers that, although they work in a plane, provide characteristics corresponding to PVTOL (Planar Vertical TakeOff and Landing) and their derivatives. Some studies apply to test systems, where the propeller is rigid with the arm rotating with the rocker arm. Motivated by the aforementioned fault-tolerant control of a propeller-driven parallelogram pendulum is proposed that varies the previous concept, maintaining the force of the propellers vertically, using a Luenberger state estimator, and applying an approximate model. of Lyapunov, as well as the pole assignment technique.
