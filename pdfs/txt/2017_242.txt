ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Smartphones have become the most widely used communication technology because of their portability and relatively low cost. Its use has been increased and at least seven billion people (95% of the global population) have access to a mobile-cellular network, according to the ICT Facts and Figures report. However, according to the 2016 report, Trends in Security published by ESET, the number of mobile vulnerabilities has increased every year since 2013 and, throughout 2015 the rate of creation of threats within the Android ecosystem, that put at risk the privacy of their information, grew with an average of 200 new samples of malware per month. This article shows a state of art, as a result of Systematic Literature Review, in order to identify techniques and tools that use data analysis in vulnerabilities detection in Smartphones with Android operating system, to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of their information.
