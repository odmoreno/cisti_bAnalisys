Learning experiences design: Integration of e-learning environments
ABSTRACT
Teachers, tutors and students detect common problems in virtual learning environments, such as: digital artifact reuse capacity, interactivity, adaptability, interoperability and usability of environments. In this sense, interventions to direct a gain of experience in a teaching-learning process are necessary, since much of the available solutions are developed without considering the real needs of these people. They stand out as impediments and main barriers for educators to the insufficiency of mastery of technological resources and familiarity with these environments. The purpose of this work is to propose a conceptual model based on information systems capable of integrating learning environments, supported by the design of ubiquitous learning experiences, which may or may not have low technological instructions, in the production of learning experiences design. The featured environment should ensure aspects of interoperability, resource reuse, collaboration, and support metadata standards, ontologies, and specifications standards for educational materials.
