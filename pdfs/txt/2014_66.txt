Business process modelling: A study case within the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budgeting and Management
ABSTRACT
Business process modelling is nowadays an important phase for requirements engineering. The description of the business process aims to reduce the distance between the users of the system and its developers. This paper presents a study case regarding the application of business process mapping using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), to develop a system for human resources management within the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management in Brazil. The system to be developed has an estimated 60,000 function points effort and involves more than 500 people in the requirements phase and more in the subsequent phases of process mapping, development, validation and test.
