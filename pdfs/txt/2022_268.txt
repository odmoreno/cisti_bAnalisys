An Educational Design Research approach for developing Open Educational Resources to doctoral education training
ABSTRACT
Open Educational Resources (OERs) can bring numerous benefits to educators, institutions and governments. However, there is still some resistance to the use of OERs in doctoral programs and higher education in general. The research question that guides this investigation is which characteristics should an OER developed for doctoral education training have in order to make its use more engaging? Under the methodological approach of Educational Design Research, this investigation will consist of three phases: context analysis, development and formative evaluation, and semi-summative evaluation. In the first phase, a systematic literature review will be conducted to analyze the use of OERs in doctoral education training, and a survey will be carried out among PhD candidates, researchers and practitioners to identify which characteristics can contribute to make OERs an engaging solution to doctoral education training. In the second phase, the OER prototype will be conceptualized, designed and developed. This prototype will go through cycles of formative evaluation, and as feedback is being received, adjustments and improvements will be carried out. In the third and and last phase, a semi-summative evaluation will be performed to make the last adjustments to the OER and finally disseminate the results in doctoral programs in TEL.
