Framework for the development of Business intelligence using computational intelligence and service-oriented architecture
ABSTRACT
The literature shows that scientific community is trying to predict or classifying some financial, economics and administrative problems with the use of computational intelligence and using frameworks to develop Business intelligence. For the reasons above, the main aim of this article is to propose a computational intelligence-based framework for the development of Business intelligence using service oriented architecture. The research method was an applied research. This paper presents the development of a framework for software development using computational intelligence. The results show that the proposed intelligent framework for Business Intelligence development systems can be considered as a tool for making business decisions.
