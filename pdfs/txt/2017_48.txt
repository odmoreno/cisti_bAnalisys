The challenges of connected data for ontology engineering
ABSTRACT
In this work we analyze the role of ontologies in the Semantic Web and the impact of the growth of open and linked data in the ontology engineering domain. Basically, we present a synthesis of the knowledge about ontologies in the field of Web Science, highlighting its role in the Semantic Web, emphasizing those that are being developed to support publishing processes of linked data in the Web. Additionally, we present a synthesis of the types of ontologies that are being created, published and used, as support for the publication of linked data, as well as relating the so-called light and heavy ontologies with the two basic functions of ontologies in the Semantic Web. Finally, we present and discuss a proposal for a conceptual framework for collaborative development of reference models for the publication and consumption of open and linked data on the Web.
