Software localisation to help terminological accuracy
ABSTRACT
Software localization is the process of adapting a software, web or mobile app to the culture and language of users in a specific market. Is a growing phenomenon, resulting from the pressing need that various public and private entities must adapt their products and services to one or more languages, locations and/or cultures. In this context, the study presented herein had as its main objective to analyse and compare two tools (OpenOffice Writer and LibreOffice Writer) in their English version and their respective translation into Portuguese, with the aim of understanding their level of terminological quality based on the Portuguese language. What is the degree of consistency between the terminology used in the interface of each of the two tools, corresponded to the main research question. The comparative study seemed to us to be the research methodology that would best suit an analysis of concrete data and respective deduction of similarities and divergences of the elements. Inconsistency can lead to incomprehension, less speed in handling and, potentially, constant errors on the part of those using the software were some of the main results. It is also pointed out points that are considered important for the improvement of localisation support tools, as well as possible suggestions to facilitate the improvement of terminological accuracy in the final products. It is hoped that this study may instigate more attentive and detailed studies that contribute to the improvement of the localisation of such tools.
