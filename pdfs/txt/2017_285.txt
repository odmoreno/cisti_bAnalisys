Print server with web user interface for real-time image control and monitoring of a 3D printer using open source tools
ABSTRACT
3D printing is a production process that has existed for three decades but its massive appearance is more recent. RepRap is a project created with the goal that more people have access to a open source low cost 3D printer. This research has been conducted based on knowledge shared by this community following their guidelines in order to take a step forward in the development of technology and cooperate with their spreading. The research has developed a prototype with a more flexible control system that allows the user a real-time control and video monitoring of the 3D printer processes through a browser from anywhere in the LAN, the control system is deployed in a reduced size computer called Raspberry Pi which could replace a PC, this control is done by implementing a print server installed on a credit card-sized single-board computer called Raspberry Pi which replace a PC and is integrated in the printer case with all the benefits generated such as the mobility an independency from other.
