ABSTRACT
To assess using intention of technologies developed in Brazilian Open Banking environment is important to predict the demand for services that will be created after the Central Bank of Brazil regulations in the sector. Inside this concept, this article uses the theoretical framework Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) to assess users’ interest in new technologies developed within the scope of open banking. A survey was carried out through a structured online questionnaire with 100 potential users and then the data were analyzed using the PLS-SEM approach. Results indicate that perceived usefulness is affected by optimism, discomfort, and insecurity, while perceived ease of use is affected only by innovativeness and discomfort. Considering that the cultural context of a country influences technology acceptance models, the present study aims to contribute to the literature, offering a view of the potential for Open Banking adoption among the portion of the population that will be users of this technology in a developing country.
