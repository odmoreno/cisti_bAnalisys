Data processing reactor for anaerobic digestion (Instrumentation, acquisition)
ABSTRACT
Most scientific studies of technologies such as anaerobic co-digestion have focused on raw materials, construction, instrumentation, control and monitoring on-line reactors; under investigation by developed countries which conduct research with elements from developing countries it have been very little studied. In this paper an analysis of the instrumentation, signal acquisition, processing and possible implementation of a control system is outlined. The selection of industrial instrumentation was developed based on the position of the reactors and the composition of the biomass for this experimentation was going to do with industrial waste of bottled fruit drinks, organic waste from the cocoa industry, sewage sludge, pig manure and municipal solid waste.
