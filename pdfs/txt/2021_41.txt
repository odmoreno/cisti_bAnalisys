Low cost EPTS (Electronic Performance & Tracking System) development using IoT devices
ABSTRACT
Today is common the interest in monitoring the behavior of groups of different types in order to reach different objectives: improving individual and collective performance, tracing and monitoring, optimizing the performance of a task, pattern analysis, coordinated work, etc. In all these situations, we are faced with the challenge of equipping each person or entity with a device capable of collecting, storing and transmitting different parameters about their behavior for further analysis. Actually, there exist different EPTS (Electronic Performance & Tracking System), being usual applying them to study sport teams' behaviour. However, due to their elevated price and that previous infrastructure may be required, have led to the impossibility of using them, except for professional sport teams.Open-source electronic prototyping platforms' spreading, becoming cheaper sensors, and improving on wireless technologies, offer new opportunities on developing low cost EPTS. The present work focuses on the construction of a complete low-cost monitoring system, and consequently accessible for non-professional clubs or collectives, being this technology extrapolated to other non-sports fields. Compounding these systems and the application of appropriate software algorithms, will allow obtaining data related to the behavior of the individual with respect to the group, to improve his individual performance, resulting in a collective improvement in the execution of tasks.
