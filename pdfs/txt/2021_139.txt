Social Costs and Geolocation Challenges through one software application
ABSTRACT
In the promotion of health and well-being strategies, the citizen needs to be geolocated during outdoor activities to mitigate incidents, reduce costs of accidents, injuries, and death and improve surveillance over her or his life. Thus, the objective of this article is to disseminate a computer application, which geolocates the citizen, through a tracking system, to guarantee their security. Methodologically, this article is subdivided: in theoretical analysis, through literature review, in the scientific area of the technology and information systems, social responsibility and accounting. And, in the experimental analysis, through the detail of the process, discussing the development of the computer application. The results of this article show social costs, directly associated with their safety and risk mitigation, and geolocation challenges, to prevent incidents and to respond to emergency situations, anticipating a solution for stakeholders.
