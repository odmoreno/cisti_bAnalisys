Personal learning environment for disabled People
ABSTRACT
Learning difficulties may affect the development of cognitive abilities, text interpretation, reading-writing, among others. Therefore, different methods and evaluation techniques are required to beincluded in virtual learning environments. This paper presents a Personal Learning Environment for People with Disabilities, a system that adapts information display in an e-learning environment, according to characteristics and difficulties of a student with mild cognitive disabilities. The Personal Learning Environment for People with Disabilities includes a neural network to classify disability type (sensory orcognitive), which becomes a base to build virtual environments that can adapt and personalize information to students, taking into account their context and profile.
