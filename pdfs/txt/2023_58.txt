Information Governance Architecture in Health Crisis Situations: Proposal from COVID 19
ABSTRACT
Health governance, as a process associated with decision-making and its implementation, plays a decisive role in the organization of services. This contribution is essential in the face of foreseeable but unforeseen occurrences, allowing for greater accountability between the different levels of management, through information systems and transparency in decisions. The response to the health needs created by foreseeable occurrences, requires an effective allocation of resources, a defined hierarchy where there is an effective articulation and communication of the various stakeholders in which there is a data/information architecture defined through a communication model. In order to understand and support the creation of knowledge for future situations of organization and management of critical events, in the component of health services response, an information governance framework for a crisis situation is proposed based on the Structuring Theory with contributions of the Uncertainty Theory and Zachman's Architectural Model.
