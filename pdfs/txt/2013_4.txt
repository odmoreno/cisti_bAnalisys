SimpleNFC: Simplifying access to digital world services using NFC
ABSTRACT
Due to the latest advances in mobile technologies, the mobile phone has turned into an almost essential device in everyday life and one which grants access to a great variety of services. However, a problem arises when it comes to interacting with devices of this kind. Thus, even if most of the population is capable of working with them, there are collectives, like the elderly, that have great difficulties in this task. To reduce the digital divide existing for this society section, we propose a platform that uses Near Field Communication (NFC) and semantic technologies. Its aim is to provide different services to the user based on the reading of a combination of tags with a mobile phone, making interaction with these devices easier and more user-friendly.
