Ncryptr: A symmetric and asymmetric encryption application
ABSTRACT
Each person carries digital devices that communicate with other person's devices and may transmit sensitive data. When the transmitted data is sensitive, it becomes necessary to implement secure mechanisms to hide the information and thus avoid it from being analyzed by third parties. This paper aims to present Ncryptr, a web-based application that allows its users to exchange encrypted instant messages in real time. Outside parties are unable to extract the contents of the messages exchanged between two or more users. Ncryptr allows its users to choose the type of encryption employed, being this a major distinction with others already existing instant messaging applications. The performance analysis is made by comparing the efficiency and latency time of different encryption methods, showing the pros and cons of using each one.
