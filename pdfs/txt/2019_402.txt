Model of Acceptance and Use of Information Technology
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Information Technologies (IT) are important pillars of specific areas of an organization and sometimes of most of its processes. However, its effectiveness depends on its use by users. Acceptance of IT depends on the relationship that users have with the technologies, so that they make their useful use. There are several models that try to explain the acceptance of technology by their respective users. This paper proposes a new model, called the Information Technology Acceptance and Use Model (MAUTI), which allows an understanding of the acceptance and use of IT in an organizational environment, and can be used when designing, developing, using, improvement or replacement of a system. Based on some of the factors considered in the most popular models, this model combines new factors in order to obtain a better explanation of the phenomenon of acceptance and use of technologies, reaching an explained variance of = 58%. Its highdegree of explanation justifies its use by organizations as an instrument for evaluating the role of their IT, its reorganization or remodeling with a view to its effective use by employees.
