Mechanism to control disconnections in multiple communication sessions using WebRTC
ABSTRACT
The continuous technological advance has generated a greater demand on the communication services. It has led to the development of new technological tools that have been able to cover this demand, and one is the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) project. This project starts as an alternative to synchronous communication or in real-time P2P (Peer-to-Peer) in web applications with the advantage that it does not require any additional software. However, this technology does not provide a mechanism for automatically reestablishing in a communication session after a disconnection with the transmission device. This work shows a solution of automatic reconnection of communication session and reduction of lost information during a disconnection over wireless networks. Using a mechanism that evaluates the communication channel's behavior with a statistical analysis and based on the implementation of proxies with Software agents in the ARW (Automatic Reconnection WebRTC) architecture, and it uses as research methodology the Design Science Research DSR. The initial achievements obtained by evaluating the ARW architecture in a controlled test environment show that this contribution allows to reestablish communication, reduce the lost information, and does not affect the user experience when it retrieves the session after a disconnection.
