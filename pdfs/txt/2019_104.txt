Plan for Automatic Adaptation of NAO Robots to Slippery Floors
ABSTRACT
This work focuses on preventing the humanoid robot NAO from falling, when walking on slippery surfaces, and on following Zero Moment Point (ZMP) reference trajectories. The presented strategy uses human-like gait with varying parameters such as step length and walking speed in order to adapt the robot's locomotion to different foot-floor friction coefficients. The gait parameters are chosen in order to minimize the probability of slipping, leading to an undesired fall. This choice of gait parameters is based on the analysis of the ground reaction forces and human behavior. Also, gait adaptation is further improved in order to follow a desired ZMP trajectory, through the use of a controller that offsets the hip and ankle joint angles. The novelty of this work lies on the fact that machine learning techniques are used to adapt the gait parameters and joint corrections to make the robot more resistant to both slipping and external disturbances.
