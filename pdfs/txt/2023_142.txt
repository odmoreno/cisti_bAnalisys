Influence of face-to-face in hybrid teaching: a case of study for a master
ABSTRACT
Online teaching is nowadays very used all around the World, especially in the field of computer science. We can currently find many university degrees that follow a hybrid approach, where the students can choose between face-to-face (attending to the classroom with the teacher) or online (followed by telematic means) teaching. Often, the implementation of this hybrid approach implies that the teaching is made at the same time to face-to-face and online students. This work studies the academic results obtained by the students of a master that follows this approach, the Master in High Performance Computing, shared between the University of A Coru’a and the University of Santiago de Compostela, during four academic years in order to analyze the impact of this approach in student’s performance.
