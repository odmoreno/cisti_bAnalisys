Assessments on National Cyber Capability: A Brazilian Perspective in a Comparison with Spain
ABSTRACT
This work proposes a comparison of Brazilian and Spanish cyber capabilities according to organisational and technical assessment criteria. Results show that some of the Spanish strategies could inspire development of Brazilian cyber capability, with benefits for both countries, who share common geopolitical goals such as the stability of Latin America and the suppression of transnational organized crime in Iberoamerica.
