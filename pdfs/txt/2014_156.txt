The use of response systems in the learning-teaching process
ABSTRACT
Over the past few years there has been a large investment in information and communication technologies in teaching-learning process. In this context, response systems emerge as an innovative tool associated with diverse methodologies and strategies. Response systems are technological products designed to support communication and interactivity, generating an enormous potential when applied in the teaching-learning process. The use of response systems and their implications in the teaching-learning are some of the challenges faced by teachers as agents boosters in the implementation of this technology in school. The student motivation increases when this technology is used leading to greater participation and consequently to a better and faster acquisition of concepts. Collaborative and cooperative attitudes among student-student, student-teacher and student-class are incremented when using response systems in the context of the classroom. This paper presents the state of the art about the use of response systems in the teaching-learning process.
