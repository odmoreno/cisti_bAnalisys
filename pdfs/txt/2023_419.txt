Using Photogrammetry for Reality Capture and Parametric Modeling of Physical Structures in a Hydroelectric Power Plant : Case study of Mascarenhas de Moraes hydropower plant
ABSTRACT
This article presents a case study on the use of photogrammetry for capturing the reality of a hydroelectric power plant, specifically the Mascarenhas de Moraes plant, with the aim of generating a parametric model of its physical structures. The photogrammetric survey was conducted using a drone to capture images of the dam, spillways, and water intake, which were then processed using Agisoft Metashape and Autodesk software. The resulting point cloud was used to create a parametric model of the plantâ€™s concrete structures in Revit. The study demonstrates the efficacy of photogrammetry in capturing the reality of complex structures such as hydroelectric power plants, and highlights the potential for further research into the use of this technique in the field of engineering.
