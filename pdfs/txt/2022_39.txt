Agro Smart : IoT Autonomous Irrigation System
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, it is common to see irrigation systems wasting water, because of the quantity used, because the irrigation system stays on even when it is raining or when we know it is going to rain that day. This paper presents an irrigation system set on an IoT platform, it is possible to act in real time accordingly to the atmospheric/weather conditions. So, through parameterized and automated systems, it is possible to stop the irrigation plan of a garden, green space, or agricultural land. Later, using sensors, the system may or may not be activated in case the levels of soil moisture and luminosity do not respond to the parameterized needs. It is an efficient and sustainable solution that is available for all agriculture irrigation systems. To test the solution, unit tests were made, and a group of tests with all sensors connected was also done. This system implements an alternative method for the data flow and its monitoring, including that the system is aware of the user. The proposed system proved to be efficient and fulfilled the requirements.
