Real time simulation of arm prosthetics through a myoelectric sensor
ABSTRACT
The present research work is about the simulation in real time to control the movement of an arm, through the acquisition of myoelectric data. The system can help the development and perfection of upper limb prostheses through the use of the tools LabVIEW, SolidWorks, Arduino and Muscle Sensor v3.
