Work in progress: Online resource platform for mathematics education
ABSTRACT
Mathematics is intrinsic to engineering and as such plays an integral role in the education of engineers. New challenges are being faced in higher education particularly in the areas of student motivation, engagement and attainment. As a result mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. Traditional methods of delivery such as lectures and tutorials need to evolve to counter these challenges with new pedagogical approaches explored including the use of new technologies. Today's students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. This paper describes a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology to develop and explore the use of a Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) that integrates a web-based platform for the study of mathematics as part of an active learning constructivist setting. Students will utilise graphics tablets to create online content consisting of solutions to mathematical problems which will then be used by other students to reinforce core concepts. The platform will provide active support to engineering students especially those in their first year of study and mature students returning to education. It is expected that early use of the platform will help identify areas of weakness and provide the self-learning environment required for students to become more proficient in those areas. By challenging the student to demonstrate an active engagement in their learning and by encouraging the meaningful use of technology in the classroom, an improvement in the quality of learning that students experience should be realised.
