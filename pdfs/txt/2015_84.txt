Assisted searches for open data portals
ABSTRACT
Increasingly, public administrations and some companies are providing your data in reusable formats. Those that choose to offer the highest quality data reuse usually have a SPARQL access point so that applications that use them can make queries directly. Instead, citizens do not have that option because they generally do not know the SPARQL language. This article proposes a model to generate SPARQL queries against a opendata server from intuitively selectable options from a Web form, providing usefulness to the open data portals.
