Use of educational platforms and student academic stress during COVID-19
ABSTRACT
This study aims to analyse the effects of the use of educational platforms and student academic stress generated during periods of social confinement by COVID-19. The convergent research design was used in two sections. In the first section, 160 validated and reliable surveys were administered to students to ascertain and contrast the quali-quantitative results. The second section consisted of 10 interviews with students at a Peruvian university, in which the stressful situation experienced by the students was revealed through interpretative hermeneutic analysis. The results show that there is no relationship between the use of educational platforms and academic stress among university students. The symptomatology presented at this stage is casual and temporary.
