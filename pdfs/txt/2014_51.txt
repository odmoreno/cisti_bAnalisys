AAL systems and services for end users: Are the AT models and frameworks suitable for prescription and selection?
ABSTRACT
The complexity inherent to Ambient Assisted Living raises some of issues not yet quiet solved within similar fields like Assistive Technology, namely those related with prescription and selection. This paper aims to identify models of frameworks for the prescription of AT that may serve as a foundation to develop comprehensive models for the selection, prescription and counselling process of ALL solutions. A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Eric and CiteSeerX databases using a predefined strategy. The relevant literature extracted was screened and a list of models and frameworks was elaborated. Seven models or frameworks were included for analyses. It was possible to find ICF components in all of the models or frameworks. The results showed a shift between the models from the end of last century, based in an instrumental description of components involved to a predictive end users behaviour concern. Future work should deepen the conceptual issues about the selection, prescription and counselling process of AAL systems and services.
