Person-oriented interface transparent access to interpersonal communication services
ABSTRACT
New communication and social interaction tools, such as social networks, are not usually designed taking into account collectives with little technological knowledge and interaction difficulties, as is the case of the elderly. This leads to an undesirable increase in the digital divide and the degree of isolation corresponding to these groups. Hence, in this work we propose the HiSozial platform, which, making use of person-oriented interfaces, service encapsulation, a combination of diverse interaction technologies and personalization, aims to make these tools accessible to the aforementioned collectives. We also present the evaluation carried out to demonstrate the validity of our proposal, including a comparative study with two applications which are not targeted at collectives with interaction difficulties.
