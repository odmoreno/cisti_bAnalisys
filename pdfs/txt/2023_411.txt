Parla! A proposal for a Brain-Computer Interface assistive communication software protocol to translate thought to speech for deaf, hard of hearing or individuals with severe paralysis by using brain waves signal datasets obtained from a brain implant
ABSTRACT
The goal of the article is to introduce a speculative educational design project based on an assistive communication approach to provide deaf, hard of hearing or individuals with paralysis an unmodified electronic commercial speech synthesis voice assistant software tool. The system will work as a prosthesis capable of translating thoughts to speech by processing brain waves signals from a brain implant. The article also aims to create a thought to speech translation dictionary database and protocol by using machine learning, neural nets and LLMs.
