Proposal for the implementation of quality multi-models in small and medium-sized Information Technology (IT) companies (SMEs)
ABSTRACT
Quality management models seek to make companies more competitive, but implementation is a major challenge, especially for small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) in Information Technology (IT). The implementation of one or more models involves high costs, a lot of bureaucracy, high time, and risks of not achieving the objectives. Within this context, this article seeks to establish a viable path with a proposal to plan, do, check, and act, seeking the best efficiency of internal processes in order to make IT SMEs more competitive. Exploratory bibliographical research, documental survey, and action research in an IT SME company were carried out and ended with triangulation of the results. In this way, we seek to establish a viable path for a process of implementing quality multi-models.
