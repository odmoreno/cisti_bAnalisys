Cuscarias: A cultural social information system based on co-creation
ABSTRACT
“Cuscar” is a Portuguese word which means gossip. So, when we talk about Cuscarias we can link the idea to a gossip local or a local to look for information and create knowledge. The system concept is based on technology to support citizen's co-creation providing information to a certain place - Cuscaria - whether it's a tourist spot or a coffee shop where people come together. Anyone can create a Cuscaria but need to contact the platform owners to mark the local with a beacon and with a theme. To access the information available for each Cuscaria, share experiences and emotions related to it, it is necessary to travel to the place where it is, to access its physical identifier (Beacon). Hence, anyone is able to find other people with the same interests and at the end of the day this system and concept promote in an effective way a place of acquaintance where is possible to achieve an interesting place to socialize. Also, it's possible to apply analytics to the platform to check trends and to support local strategies.
