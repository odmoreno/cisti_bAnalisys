Introduction to Blended Learning in Financial Accounting with SimEmp Application
ABSTRACT
With the need to adopt and combine different forms of teaching and learning, the Business Simulator (SimEmp-Avaliação) was used as a tool to support the initiation of blended learning in financial accounting. SimEmp- Avaliação allows to combine face-to-face teaching with the development of other online activities. Thus, teachers define a set of questions and the respective resolution, which can be used in one or more evaluations and the students, in a defined time and outside the classroom, answer these questions and / or develop different elements of financial statements. At the end of the evaluation period, the application automatically presents the classification of each student and allows the teacher to view the answers to the questions.
