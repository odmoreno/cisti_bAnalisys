Audio folios management system for foreign language learning
ABSTRACT
Teaching and learning using technology has, for some years, been the focus of various researchers. From vocational schools, through basic education to higher education, the use of teaching aids based on information technologies is now a common practice. Today, more than making large computing solutions to support the activities of e-learning, it is important to focus on software specific solutions whose cost of production / implementation has a quick return. In this context the need emerged to move forward with a system to support teaching and learning of foreign languages to facilitate communication between teachers and students. It is on this issue that we present a proposal to develop a computing solution that enables students to develop the skills of reading and speaking foreign languages within the classroom context or outside the classroom. In this specific case we address the English language. We also present a working prototype, which is available as freeware for the educational and the scientific community and can be used without restriction. Experimentally, tests were made with 20 volunteer students from ESTGL. They used the prototype, in order to validate the usability tests. Finally, we present some results that show the progression of learning in those students who used the system.
