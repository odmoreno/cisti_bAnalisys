Application of a neuro fuzzy network in prediction of absenteeism at work
ABSTRACT
Competitiveness, market share, professional development and personal support to community action, health, culture, education and sport, are linked to a promising new market. Coupled with the development of organizations, the pressure to achieve goals more audacious, employees increasingly overwhelmed, they end up buying some disturbance in the health-related type of labor activity. The objective of this paper is to apply a neuro fuzzy network in the prediction of absenteeism at work. To make the database were collected records of absenteeism from work during the period of July/07 to July/2010 in a Courier company. Absences certified with the International Classification of Diseases were stratified into 21 categories, the data were tabulated and filtered in MS Excel software. A neuro fuzzy network was developed using an artificial neural network architecture multilayer perceptron with the error backpropagation algorithm. This paper presents partial results of the use of neuro fuzzy network to predict absenteeism at work.
