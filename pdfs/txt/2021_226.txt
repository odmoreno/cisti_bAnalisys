Improving accuracy of an existing semantic word labelling tool using word embeddings
ABSTRACT
Annotated corpora allow researchers to carry out studies that include linguistic phenomena such as grammatical categories or even knowledge by means of semantic annotation. Semantic annotation in corpus linguistics is often included into every lexical unit of the corpus using a word labelling tool. Resources such as lexicons or ontologies are very useful for this purpose. However, current sizes of these resources for languages different from English are not always appropriate. This paper proves that an updated version of an existing NLP baseline can be extended for different domains and, as a consequence, it is able to improve Spanish token accuracy by up to 30% in comparison with using only a small lexicon.
