Maintenance of building components supported in interactive environments
ABSTRACT
The main objective of the research was to develop a technological tool to support the maintenance activity of buildings. There were analyzed three main components of the building: roofs, facades and interior walls. A building's roof covering of ceramic tiles constitutes a component of its surrounding and possesses an important function in its protection against the permeation of moisture and rain water; Facade coatings play a significant role in the durability of buildings, since they constitute the exterior layer that ensures the protection of the wall against the aggressive actions of physical, chemical or biological nature; The paint coating applied to interior walls conveys their aesthetic character, performs an important function of protection, and is exposed to agents of deterioration related to the building use. A survey of the main anomalies that occur in these components, the respective causes and the adequate interventions, in order to plan maintenance strategies was conducted. The information collected serves as a basis in the implementation of applications using interactive visualization technologies, to support the planning of building maintenance. This research work brings an innovative contribution to the field of maintenance supported by emergent technology.
