Improvement proposal of the effort estimation in software projects using use case points
ABSTRACT
This research makes a proposal that helps improve the accuracy of the effort estimation using the Use-Case Points method applied to software development projects. In order to determine the proposal a study of the factors that affect the accuracy of the estimation of the Use-Case Points method is carried out. As a result of the study of factors, the contributions of improvement of each author are rescued being used in a quasi-experiment, with the purpose of combining all the contributions that help to improve the Use Case Points method and as a final result to select the best combination of contributions that offers the slightest deviation in the precision of the estimate of the effort.
