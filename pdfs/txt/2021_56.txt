The Web Challenges in the Training Process â€“ The humansoft Case Study
ABSTRACT
The constant evolution of web technologies has led to the appearance of platforms that ease the management of users' tasks today. To maximize customer satisfaction and provide solutions according to current market standards, companies must adapt their products, with a particular focus on web-based solutions, considering the increase of the user experience. In this way, this paper presents a web development real case study, in the humansoft company, where several modules were developed related to the two main products of the company, namely, humantrain, which is a system for managing the training process, and humanportal, which is a web application that allows the interoperability among humantrain and the web. Both applications allow training providers and/or companies to profit from the management of their resources, both at a pedagogical and financial level.
