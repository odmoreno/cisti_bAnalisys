The impact of human-centric design on the adoption of information systems: A case study of the spreadsheet
ABSTRACT
The spreadsheet is one of the most popular information systems ever: It is exceedingly widely adopted, it has attracted significant amounts of investment and innovation by companies, and it has become a platform for new research. To uncover reasons for the spreadsheet's success, this paper applies a research method, the case study, to analyze the historical development and adoption of this important information system. The study revealed insights for the design and commercialization of future systems. These include the need for specific collaborative relationships, the multiple forms of evidence and validation required, and the role of usability as a dominant quality attribute driving adoption.
