Models of self-regulation of social network and other websites in EU public service media
ABSTRACT
Public Service Media (PSM) is in Europe in a crisis of adaptation to the new social demands and technological changes brought about by Web platforms and social networks. Some PSM are incorporating codes or manuals on the corporate and personal use that their employers must make of the new technologies. This self-regulation has opened the door to debates and discussions about the ease it could interfere with other rights. This research tries to know the main challenges in public media in Europe, in general, and in Spain, in particular. The reason for this singularity is that in this country in a few months several PSM have incorporated this type of manuals and guidelines, which have sometimes generated a certain controversy about their purpose and use.
