Metrics to evalute fuctional quality: A sistematic review
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, quality assurance of software products is very important. To assure this quality, there exist several international standards like the standard ISO 25010. These standards define quality models, characteristics and sub-characteristics that must be taken into account in order to evaluate the quality of a software product. In this context, metrics are needed to evaluate quality objectively. This document shows a systematic review of the literature about the existing metrics that can be used to measure functional quality (as defined in the international standard ISO 25010) of a software product. As results of the conducted review, 23 metrics were found, most of them based on tests. The conclusions obtained from this study show that, although more metrics should be defined, there exists a enough number of metrics to measure all the functional quality characteristics defined in the international standard ISO 25010.
