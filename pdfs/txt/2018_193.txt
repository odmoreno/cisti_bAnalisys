A methodological proposal to learn to program through the development of video games
ABSTRACT
With the advent of the digital era, new technologies have brought technological changes, which have permeated the industry, the media and, in general, society. These technological advances should encourage that education pass from the transmission of content to the creation of meaningful learning environments. The lack of these changes means that students must overcome a series of situations that range from very rigid courses in their methodology, centered on the teacher, and not on the learner, generating apathy and disinterest in learning. Therefore, this work proposes to use teaching-learning methodologies that allow a greater participation of the student during their cognitive process, involving their interests and passions, facilitating collaborative work, and above all, generating motivation to learn. This is why this article proposes a methodological approach aimed at teaching-learning programming based on the development of video games with the purpose of engaging and motivating students during their learning.
