Selected Multimedia Tools as a Tool to Compare Changes in the Landscape
ABSTRACT
Remote sensing is one of the most widely used methods of acquiring spatial data describing the Earthâ€™s surface, which is associated with subsequent data analysis and processing. Most often, the imagery was obtained using an aeroplane or satellite as a sensor carrier, but due to technological advances, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used. UAVs provide very-high spatial resolution data. Multimedia tools are essential during the whole processing and visualization procedure. The paper demonstrates that UAV-borne RGB data can be successfully used to detect water surface, bare land and vegetation as key land cover types. Both supervised and unsupervised classification methods are used.
