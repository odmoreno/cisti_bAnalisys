MLV-Viewer: Multi-level Visualization in Decision Support Systems Prototype
ABSTRACT
Information visualization (InfoVis) is defined as ”the use of visual, interactive and visual representations supported by computer, to increase cognition”. InfoVis tools and methods help us accelerate our understanding of a large amount of data. Datavisualization improves understanding, especially with multidimensional data sets. Visual analysis methods allow decision makers to combine their human flexibility, creativity and knowledgewith the huge storage and processing capabilities of today's computers for information about complex problems. Using advanced visual interfaces, humans can interact directly with the data analysis, adding more to their liking and need. The MLV-Viewer prototype will be described in this article.
