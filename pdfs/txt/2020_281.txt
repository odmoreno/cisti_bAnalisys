Measuring User Experience Quality of Voice Assistants
ABSTRACT
Virtual digital assistants are predicted to experience enormous growth in enterprise applications worldwide. Popular voice assistants are integrated into many devices and systems. Measuring the quality of user experience (UX) must, therefore, also be of great interest to evaluate and improve voice assistants. In this article, three scales for measuring the UX aspects of voice assistance systems are presented, which, in combination with a new questionnaire concept, allow these measurements. It is shown with which method the scales have been constructed and analysed, especially for systems with voice user interfaces. The results are three new scales for voice communication that can be combined with the modular questionnaire concept of the UEQ+.
