Training Assistant for LACT Process Through Augmented Reality
ABSTRACT
This article proposes the development of a 3D augmented reality app for mobile devices focused on staff training (training of operators) in the oil industry on the operation of Lease Automatic Custody Transfer Units (LACT Units). First, existing information about LACT Units was collected to define the basic and specific parameters for the virtual creation of a 3D model of the LACT Units (CAD files) which allows the visualization of the equipment and instruments commonly used in the LACT Units, also through the Unity 3D graphic engine a specific sequence of operation is defined attached to a real system. The application focuses on the recognition of P&ID through a smartphone allowing users to make changes in the variables involved in the process, e.g., pressure, temperature and flow, such that, if the user makes any changes to the variables, the system responds according to these changes based on mathematical models of the plant, achieving a more realistic experience between the user and the process.
