A potpourri of authentication mechanisms the mobile device way
ABSTRACT
Nowadays the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are rapidly increasing in network services, proliferating to almost every environment. This massive appearance of mobile devices creates significant opportunities to leverage these mobile devices to establish novel types of services. However there are also significant concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive data exchanged and stored on these devices. Since these devices are usually embodied with numerous characteristics like camera devices, 3G and NFC connection that can be used to create new alternative authentication schemes in order to guarantee users identity. This paper performs a survey on the current state of the art in alternative authentication mechanisms regarding access and authentication against the traditional login and password scheme by the usage of the mobile devices and their properties.
