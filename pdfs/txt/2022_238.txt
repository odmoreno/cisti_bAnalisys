The role of People Analytics in the future of Human Resources
ABSTRACT
Data Analysis has been one of the most internal themes of the times. In the Digital Transformation that we live in today, there are several and varied as its implementations. However, in Human Resources, even though Human Resource Management Systems (HRIS) is already rooted, the development of data analysis is slow to appear. This is due to the scepticism existing in the area's professionals regarding People Analytics and the ethical issue of reducing people to data. This work discusses what People Analytics is, what topics can be developed, how HRIS can be transformed and what the future this area will have within companies. This work intends to contribute in this topic discussion, since it is relevant on Human Resources Management jobs, but also on the technological functions, mainly on information systems implementation to data collection, and in data analytics, both to promote data-driven approaches and decisions.
