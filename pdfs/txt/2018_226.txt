Crowd sensing and delay tolerant networks to support decision making at the routing level
ABSTRACT
Sensing combines the ubiquity of smartphones and different types of sensors to collect data from different aspects of the city. Sensing is the process of transmitting collected data for processing by a remote centralized system; which requires a constant and wide coverage of the communication network infrastructure, which is not always possible. In this context, Delay Tolerant Networks, where applications need to transmit data in the environment of an intermittent or even non-existent network infrastructure, appear as a complementary and innovative alternative. In Delay Tolerant Networks, applications, in addition to inheriting their benefits, also inherit the challenges of decision-making in message forwarding. In this article we analyze the importance of the Delay Tolerant Networks in the supporting of the decision making at the routing level, making the messaging process proactive.
