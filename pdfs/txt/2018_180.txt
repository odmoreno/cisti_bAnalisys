A geolocation model of health centers specialized in pediatrics and family medicine using the concept of mobile network
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, accessibility to the Internet has increased remarkably; and the use of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, PCs currently allow people to access a wide variety of applications, among which are those that allow locating places such as hotels, hospitals, parks, restaurants, thus allowing quick access to information. The present work emphasizes applications that allow the geolocation and location of almost any site, presenting a solution, to the location of all specialized health centers in pediatrics and family medicine located in the city, either the closest to the location current, or a nearby alternative, so this paper describes the development of a web application that improves search and location services, through the use of GPS technology and implementation of the Google Maps API. In addition to the implementation of XML files and the 3 layers architecture so that the presentation of the data is faster and more dynamic for the user. All this following the development process presented by the Scrum methodology.
