Vital Signs Monitoring Sensors and Devices : A Case Study on Some of the Main Devices Used
ABSTRACT
Physical activity is fundamental in modern society in order to achieve a healthy lifestyle. In fact, it contributes to a significant improvement in the physical and mental health of citizens, allowing an enhancement in their quality of life. To take better advantage of these benefits it is important to monitor and control some physical and mental parameters of the participants. This monitoring will serve not only to boost the practice of sport but also to potentially detect some physical problems of the person. This paper presents a study of some of the most used sensors and devices, whose common goal is the monitoring of training data by the practitioner. This study is fundamental as it allows to identify the different devices currently used, as well as the type of data they collect, something essential to determine the type of analysis that can be done using these devices. The applications for analyzing and processing this data will also be studied, which will provide a complete overview, from the collection to the processing and analysis of the data.
