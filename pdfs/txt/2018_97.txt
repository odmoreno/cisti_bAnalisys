Mistype resistant keyboard (NexKey)
ABSTRACT
Nexkey Project is aimed at developing an android keyboard capable of identifying frequently used words to provide personalized and improved typing experience. It uses a prediction system that makes use of an Android API for implementation. The keyboard has an elastic layout that manipulates the selected key which is predicted to be clicked next and the victim key which is predicted to not be clicked. It gives the selected key more width and reduces width of the victim key. The application always looks for the victim key which could be on either side of the selected key. The proposed project can well provide an alternative to already available keyboards on the app store which provide on-screen suggestions, something which could easily be annoying for the users. Our application facilitates users to type in at high speed without looking at the keyboard. NexKey also reduces the use of backspace key as demonstrated through empirical validation of the project.
