ClickOnMap: A platform for development of Volunteered Geographic Information systems
ABSTRACT
The Web 2.0 enabled better interaction between users and Web systems, resulting in the concept of User-Generated Content (UGC). UGC with a geographic component is called Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Systems that collect and distribute this type of content are called VGI systems. In cases of emergency or natural disaster, we must quickly create a VGI system to help in the management and decision making. This paper presents the ClickOnMap, a platform to develop VGI systems quickly and with little effort. It also offers methods that can improve the quality of VGI. This platform also has a mobile application that allows the generation of real-time collaborations for the developed systems, even in the absence of Internet. In addition, it presents three systems called Cidadão Viçosa-MG, Mossoró Crimes and Gota D'Água, which were developed using ClickOnMap. Each system can have its own rules and policies of collection, analysis, validation, deployment of VGI. Moreover, each system has a level of quality of its VGI.
