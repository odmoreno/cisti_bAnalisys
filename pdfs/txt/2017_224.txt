The Internet and the online social networks on the 2016's Portuguese presidential elections
ABSTRACT
The continuous expansion of information technologies, particularly those related to communication and diffusion of personal computers, tablets and smartphones connected to the Internet has allowed a radical reformulation of the systems of information. Currently politicians are increasingly using the Internet and Online Social Networks increasingly as political marketing tools to influence the vote decision of their electorate. For this study was made an online questionnaire about the importance of Facebook in choosing the presidential candidate in the January 2016's elections and an analysis of the Online Social Networks used by the presidential candidates during the campaign period.
