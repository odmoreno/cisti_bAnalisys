Optimization model for the load assignment of academic load
ABSTRACT
Optimizing processes is essential to reduce costs, improve product quality and ensure the sustainability of organizations. This research proposes a support system to automate the assignment of the teaching load of an educational unit, maximizing teacher satisfaction with the assigned subjects, reducing administrative times and increasing the process transparency. [1] [2] guidelines were followed, applying the integer linear programming model, using Excel and R programs to solve the mathematical problem. The findings show that 84% of teachers will have maximum satisfaction in assigned subjects, and the rest reach 80% satisfaction. Additionally, 92% of the subjects were designated to teachers with maximum experience, knowledge and preference for them, for the remaining 8% the satisfaction range was between 80-93%, which will benefit the teaching act.
