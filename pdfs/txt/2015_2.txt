Analysis of the utilization of Web 2.0 resources in secondary education and advanced vocational training studies
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a study to address the use of Web 2.0 tools in education. The study focuses on secondary education and is limited to the region of Madrid (Spain). The main objectives of the study are to determine the involvement of both teachers and students in the use of Web 2.0 tools. Moreover, we will also examine the different parameters associated with the acceptance and application of Web 2.0 resources. Finally, we will describe the different patterns of interaction of both students and teachers with respect to these digital platforms. As a result, we will be in position of assessing the convenience and acceptance of artifacts based on the Web 2.0 paradigms to be used as effective resources to improve the students' learning experience.
