Audiovisual Internet Genres A proposal for classification based on an analysis of the Net
ABSTRACT
Traditionally, the analysis of audiovisual material has required classification into types or genres, to enable comparison in a common framework. Audiovisual genres vary according to the medium (for example, there are film genres and television genres). The aim of this study was to classify genres of audiovisual material produced for the Internet, by analysing a sample of it. A random sample of audiovisual products that met the requirements was selected and analysed using an ad-hoc tool, and considering technical aspects as well as the language of the medium. The result of the study was a classification of genres, based on a comparison of the results obtained for the sample using inferential techniques and the literature on the subject
