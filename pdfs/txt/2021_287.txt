Presence and characteristics of communicational citizenship in Ecuador's mass media
ABSTRACT
Communicational citizenship implies traditional values of democracy such as freedom, equality and social justice, but by virtue of new emerging interests and rights, it is associated with diversity, ecological awareness, gender defense and integration, among other categories. The purpose of this work is to identify the manifestations of communicational citizenship in the local and national media of Ecuador through the study of their websites. The methodology is quantitative, qualitative, descriptive and relational through content analysis and expert interviews. For the content analysis, data will be collected between November 2020 and January 2021 regarding news or information where key words related to the concept of citizenship appear. The manifestations of communicational citizenship are expressed in conventional forms. The informative coverage does not advance at the same pace as social demands, there is a risk of not making social groups visible and indirectly avoiding contributing to the quality of democracy in Ecuador.
