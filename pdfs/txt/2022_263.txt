Overview of the Trajectories of an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot based on a Single Motion Command
ABSTRACT
The main benefit of using an omnidirectional motion system in a robot is that it provides three degrees of freedom, allowing motion in any direction while changing the orientation. This paper describes the omnidirectional motion system used in a real three-wheeled assistance mobile robot. This paper presents the ideal simulation of the basic trajectories that this robot can perform with a single motion command. These basic trajectories are the basis of complex trajectories defined by sequences of single motion commands. In the future, the results of the simulations will be applied to improve the path-planning of a real robot in order to generate smooth trajectories and improve social acceptability of mobile robots operating in environments shared with humans.
