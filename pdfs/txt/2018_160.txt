Structuring performance management best practices for citizen assistance systems in the Public Defender's Office/Brazil
ABSTRACT
Best practices are the subject of constant study and evaluation in the areas of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). In government, technological solutions rely on the support of innumerable structural systems. It is important to note that government structural systems are complex in nature, so the information in them should be organized, interoperable with other systems, highly available and still considered secure against attacks in computing environments. The application of best practices in the structuring of applications and their environments aims to meet such objectives. This study demonstrates the performance evolution of the SISDPU application of the Public Defender's Office, achieved through the application of best practices for optimization of the available computational infrastructure in their system.
