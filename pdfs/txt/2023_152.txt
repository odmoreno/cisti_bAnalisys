BiB-Ana: a tool to detect emerging technologies through topic modeling and Generative Artificial Intelligence
ABSTRACT
Scientific production has grown significantly in recent years. Due to the considerable and increasing volume of data obtained from these publications, methods, techniques, and methodological tools and computational applications are required for bibliographic and bibliometric surveys. However, the bibliometric tools available on the market do not have all the necessary functions for a complete analysis in a single application, requiring the orchestration of a set of tools. This work presents a tool for detecting emerging technologies through topic modeling and generative artificial intelligence. Finally, the tool was applied to analyze the convergence of themes between Science (scientific articles) and Technology (patents) for the subject of virtual world, where it was possible to highlight seven topics of convergence.
