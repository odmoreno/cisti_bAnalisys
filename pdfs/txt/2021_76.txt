Expenditure on R&D, GDP and its impact on the Ecological footprint in South America
ABSTRACT
Investment in R&D generates several interactions in society and its quality of life and therefore with the environment. However, production processes and population growth mean that the need for resources increases over time. This research aims to analyze the relationship between R&D expenditure, gross domestic product and ecological footprint in South America, using a panel methodology that will facilitate cross-cutting analysis and time series. The results show that there is a direct relationship between GDP and the Ecological Footprint that countries have, however, the relationship with R&D spending is inverse, highlighting their importance and the implementation of appropriate public policy that preserves natural resources or, if not, allows them to be exploited more sustainably by promoting cleaner technologies.
