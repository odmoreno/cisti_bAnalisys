Educational metadata ontology enrichment for e-assessment semantic description. Towards question and test interoperability and reuse
ABSTRACT
Learning Management Systems (LMS) were developed with different platforms and technologies. Consequently, sharing learning resources and components has become a major challenge. E-assessment as a primary activity of any learning process is facing the same challenges and problems. With the capability to use semantic technologies, more specifically ontologies, it is easier to have a technology based learning systems that enable educators to share the learning resources. This paper focuses on the development and implementation of an ontology for e-assessment interoperability. The ontology is based on standards for learning object description widely used in global learning community. This ontology collaborates with flexibility and enhances the possibility of sharing the e-assessment system components between educators in high level education environments.
