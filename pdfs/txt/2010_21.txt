The forgotten practices of subcontracting
ABSTRACT
For many software projects the complexity of the final product has increased to a level where it is impossible to build the whole application from the scratch. So, many organizations consider subcontracting as an option for software development. This paper shows generic problems related to software subcontracting. Also, an analysis of CMMI-DEV subcontracting practices to solve these problems is presented. The review also highlights that there are many critical management practices related to outsourcing to ensure a successful overall project.
