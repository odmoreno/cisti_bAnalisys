Ubiquitous meaningful learning: Practices in the urban context
ABSTRACT
Mobile and ubiquitous technologies allow new learning opportunities anytime and anywhere. In these types of learning with mobility, there are mechanisms that combine digital and real scenarios using mobile and ubiquitous technologies. However, few of them analyze the effectiveness of actual learning experiences. To address this problem, this study proposes an evaluative approach to learning in ubiquitous learning situations in an urban context. To evaluate the importance of learning, a two-month experiment was carried out in a professional course of a public school in Brazil. During this time, teachers and students participated in a ubiquitous learning situation, consisted of a platform called Youubi on their mobile devices. The results showed that the introduction of the integrated u-learning environment in everyday situations generated an involvement in the process of discoveries and associations with evidences of the real world of the apprentices, favoring the significant construction of knowledge.
