Air traffic control with Microsoft Flight Simulator X
ABSTRACT
Over the years, air transport has increased gradually. This increase can cause difficulties in air traffic management, reducing its effectiveness. The use of intelligent agents in air traffic management seems to be a promising approach to overcome this difficulty. Thus this paper proposes the creation of a multi-agent system for autonomous air traffic management. Several concepts and proposals suggested by other authors about this topic are used in this implementation in an attempt to create a system based on the strengths of each work. This work is also part of a larger project, related to the coordination of intelligent agents in the execution of joint missions. The connection between the two systems is the management of the aircrafts that perform the missions. With this system, it is possible to manage the landings and departures of the aircrafts in an airport, manage the vehicles moving on the airport and even prevent collisions between aircrafts moving in the covered airspace.
