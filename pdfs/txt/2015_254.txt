The “Malha” project: A game design proposal for multisensory stimulation environments
ABSTRACT
Multisensory stimulation environments, also known as Snoezelen Rooms, were instituted years ago as an intervention context for severely disabled persons. These spaces have been brought to light, however, for reasons quite beyond their traditional usage, not only regarding the diversity of typical clients benefiting from the activities carried out, but also when the objectives of such activities are considered. The common exploration of the ludic potential of multisensory stimulation environments by occupational therapists presented us with the problem of how to design a computer game to combine with such context, in particular when delivering therapy to children with intellectual disability. In this paper we explore how the computer-mediated ludic activity can add value to an intervention focused on playfulness, having as background context the multisensory environment. We elaborate particularly around the translation of a set of design guidelines into a simulation of the Portuguese traditional game “jogo da malha”, expanded by fantasy elements, as an orientation for a near-future project.
