Energy consumption behaviour characterization with mobile gamification
ABSTRACT
Excessive electric energy consumption results in high costs for consumers, and often on using non-renewable resources. Additionally, in many cases, it is difficult for the consumer or for the energy provider to determine if one or more equipment is being used efficiently. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to promote awareness about energy consumption. For that purpose, a mobile application with a gamification approach was designed to identify users' behaviors towards the use of energy and, based on the user's answers, offer advices to save energy and promote ecological awareness. The outcome of using gamification on a mobile application with such goals results in a streamlined data collection application that combines information and entertainment. The collected information is being gathered to potentially create consumer profiles that better reflect the user's energy consumption.
