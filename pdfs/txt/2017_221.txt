Visual stories in business intelligence to support decision making
ABSTRACT
Information visualization is emerging in a new era in which social considerations, complex data and state-of-the-art technology are considered for making sense of data and then, effectively communicate valuable information to the audience for decision making. Although prior research provides frameworks for data visualization, their scope is often focused on diversifying visualization types instead of the complexity and the stories behind data. This paper proposes an interactive information visualization model for business intelligence using the storytelling technique. Thus, we conducted a qualitative study with six information visualization novices. As a result, we identify five categories and thirteen information factors that were included in the proposed model.
