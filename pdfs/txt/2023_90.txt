Clustering the Behavior of Objective Measures in Associative Classifiers
ABSTRACT
Associative classifiers (ACs) have been widely used in several domains due to their inherent interpretability, with CBA being the most used algorithm in the family. They are built in steps, one of them aimed at ranking the rules, usually performed through objective measures (OMs). Aiming to improve its performance, works seek to modify its sorting step (i) using new measures and/or existing measures individually or (ii) aggregating existing measures to use them simultaneously. However, more than 60 OMs are available in the literature. Therefore, this work aims to group these OMs according to their performance when applied in the ACs sorting step. 15 groups were obtained, which are ranked according to their performance. This work contributes to the improvement and/or development of works, providing guidance for choosing the most appropriate OMs. An example of the impact of the groups obtained is also presented.
