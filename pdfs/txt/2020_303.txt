Agile transformation in e-government projects
ABSTRACT
Agile transformation, i.e. a paradigm shift from a plan-oriented to a human-oriented approach, enables a far more user-centered development of digital products. In turn, such agile transformation offers great promise in the implementation of e-government projects in public administration. It was found that such agile paradigm can reduce the risk of failure in e-government projects through a high degree of communication and through an affinity to change regarding the requirements. In this article we have outlined the current state of our research regarding the measurement of the progress of agile transformation in public administration through the use of a screening instrument. This is done by building upon previous research in the area which describes the applicability of the screening instrument in the field of public administration. The scope of application of this screening instrument will then be broadened by defining a prototypical recommendation for usage, enabling continuous and targeted improvement in the course of agile transformation. This recommendation describes an iterative process comprised of seven steps. Defining concrete practices and methods for each of these steps will enable the development of this process which can then support a targeted agile transformation in public administration.
