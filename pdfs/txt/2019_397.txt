Internet radio research: A review of applied methodologies
ABSTRACT
The birth of cybermedia along with the revolution of social networks have generated great changes in the processes of mediation. The radio as a means of communication with the listener has adapted to the use of new technologies in different ways, finding the way to survive once again in front of the new competitor. In this context, the present research carries out a study of 125 articles from scientific journals of the last decade, in order to obtain an overview of the scientific topics and methodologies addressed in order to determine the most widely used and their potentialities, as well as, identify if there is an innovation in the methods that investigate radio on the internet. The results are obtained through a methodology mainly quantitative, but that has required qualitative support for the analytical observation of different general and methodological variables of the publications. In addition, the variables were correlated, which allowed to identify the work done by the Latin American researchers in the area. Among the main findings of the research is the scarce research generated from Latin American countries, as well as the large number of descriptive and exploratory studies that do not show greater innovation in the techniques and instruments applied.
