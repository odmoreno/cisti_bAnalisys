An Exploratory Analysis on the Perception of Teachers regarding the Monitoring of Interactions and Activities in the Collaborative Tools of Virtual Learning Environments
ABSTRACT
Tracking interactions and activities on Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with an increasing number of collaborative tools, offering real-time support for students, is one of the most intense and exhaustive challenges online teachers face. Teachers must improve themselves, acquire different skills, and be available for a longer time to meet the needs of students. This research analyzed 131 Higher and Vocational teachers' Survey answers regarding their experiences about two main questions - the effort to follow up interactions and activities in Virtual Learning Environments' collaborative tools and their perception about Chatbots as a teacher assistant to performing routine and repetitive tasks.
