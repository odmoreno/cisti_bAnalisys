IoT single board computer to replace a home server
ABSTRACT
Home servers are popular among computer enthusiasts for hosting various applications, including Linux OS with web servers, database solutions, and private cloud services, as well as for VPN, torrent, file-sharing, and streaming. Single Board Computers (SBCs), once used for small projects, have now evolved and can be used to control multiple devices in the IoT space. SBCs have become more powerful and can run many of the same applications as traditional home servers. In light of the energy crisis, this study will examine the feasibility of replacing a conventional home server with an SBC while maintaining service quality and evaluating performance and availability. The power consumption of both solutions will be compared.
