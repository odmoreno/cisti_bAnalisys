3D technologies applied to architectural teaching
ABSTRACT
We present this paper as the result of an educational research project at the School of Architecture of Barcelona, in which we demonstrate, by means of a study case focused on the Host Course, HC, that using a reverse strategy, opposed to the traditional pedagogical strategy, in which future architecture students start to use first ICT tools and 3D technologies instead of the traditional drawing, their graphic training, visual education, understanding of the space, academic performance and satisfaction as users of computer applications, are superior, with shorter periods for learning.
