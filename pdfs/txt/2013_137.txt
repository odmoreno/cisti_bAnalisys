Terminais de Bilh√©tica na Nuvem cloud terminals for ticketing systems
ABSTRACT
The aim of the present work, in the field of Cloud Computing (CC), is to contribute for the evolution of traditional ticketing systems to integrated systems in CC. The CC paradigm suggests virtual infrastructures, scalable and automated management of shared resources in the same business model. The management of equipment and core ticketing processes, subscribed by transport operators, are available in the model Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and payment is based on the use (pay per use). The provision of ticketing services for wide functional scope with reduced implementation cost and adapted to the dynamics of the business is the main goal of the SmartCities project developed jointly by a company and an academic institution.
