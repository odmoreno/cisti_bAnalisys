VITA 2.0 â€“ Class evaluation system
ABSTRACT
The high dropout rate of students in public education often has causes linked to non-obvious issues. Very large classes or even a distance between the student and the teacher are the reasons that make a difficult solution for the teacher. In this context, a tool that helps the teacher's perception of these problems is extremely important. The objective of this work is to propose a system that helps in the perception of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of students in relation to classes. At the same time, it's proposed a tool that obtains better results compared to others already created with similar purposes, especially the VITA tool, developed for analyzing feelings using an affective lexicon dictionary. Entitled VITA 2.0, the tool presented in this work applies sentiment analysis in opinions written by the student regarding the class. VITA 2.0 sentiment analysis is performed using the text analysis API provided by Microsoft Azure.
