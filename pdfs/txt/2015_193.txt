Free/open source software vs. proprietary software in education
ABSTRACT
In line with the international trends of free/open source software usage, in Portugal there has also been a number of recommendations in the adoption of this type of software in the Public Administration and, in particular, in Schools. In this context, several benefits have been associated with the use of free/open source software, including savings in license acquisition costs, better use of existing hardware, freedom of code use, code sharing and independence from software manufacturers. This work describes a free/open source software usage experience in a Basic School of the 2nd and 3rd cycles levels of education, involving students of the Information and Communication Technologies course. The research conducted aimed to assess whether the use of free/open source software would condition the learning objectives and outcomes of the targeted students, versus the situation of use of proprietary software.
