Development of a Collaborative Information Management Prototype through a gamification App for Android in the prevention, response and recovery of natural, technological and human disasters
ABSTRACT
This research work aims to design a prototype of a collaborative information management system, through a gamification App for Android, which provides information to the citizens of the province of El Oro in the prevention, response and recovery of natural, technological (oil spill) and human disasters. For the implementation of the Android gamification App we propose a software methodology that maintains an agile development scheme, along with the documentation that will be generated. The methodology to be used, is a process aimed at the management and development of software projects based on an iterative, agile and incremental development appropriate for this type of projects; and it is applicable to a wide set of development platforms and applications. Its phases or life cycle are: Pre-Game, Game and Post-Game.
