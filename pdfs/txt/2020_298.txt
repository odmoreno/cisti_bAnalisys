Holonote: Text editor of augmented reality oriented to people with motor disabilities
ABSTRACT
The advance of technology in the 21st century has brought about fundamental changes in the fusion of physical and technological reality. Today, with virtual reality devices, it is possible to plan a visit to a museum without leaving home, even to perform highly complex surgeries. There are several benefits that have come with these technologies, it has improved the quality and experience of games, as well as it has managed to design and plan intelligent cities. Consequently, this work proposes to provide a better experience to the user with motor difficulties when using a text editor by creating a virtual reality environment that allows to alternate the entries to the system, that is to say, to add functionalities for the handling or control of the applications such as voice recognition or the fixed glance on some component. HoloLens is a growing technology that has become popular with the emergence of several applications and thanks to the combination of physical reality in a virtual environment. For this work, an analysis of related work has been carried out, a word processor has been developed, and promising results have been tested, evaluated and validated.
