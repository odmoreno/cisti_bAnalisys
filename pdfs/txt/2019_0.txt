A society ruled by the impact of the smartphone: Influence that the use of the smartphone has in people's daily lives
ABSTRACT
The use of the smartphone in today's society has been growing through the introduction of new mobile devices in the market and the rapid evolution of communication technologies. This evolution means that this mobile device almost loses its main functions of making calls and sending messages, and also acquire the functions of a computer with a low processing capacity. Much of the addition of these new features to the mobile phone was the responsibility of the telecommunications companies, as people, when acquiring a better mobile phone, make more use of mobile data. This responsibility is shared with smartphone development companies and applications to be installed on them. With these new devices on the market, and with the variety of applications available, people have a tendency to want to acquire them, since quite easily, they can perform some functions that they previously only had with a computer. This study shows the influence that the mobile phone has on people's daily lives, namely if they can make people become dependent on it, without realizing it. Thus, an exploratory study with a quantitative methodology was carried out through the application of questionnaires, and it was verified that people use the smartphone, mainly to facilitate their daily tasks.
