Blockchain-based Value Creation for Supply Chain in COVID-19 Drug Distribution
ABSTRACT
This research explores how the supply chain application of blockchain impacts workflow across organizations to encourage value-creating opportunities by modeling the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. It focuses on 1) identifying the critical factors that could generate additional value by using blockchain in the supply chain workflow, 2) implementing a vaccine logistics scenario on a blockchain platform, and 3) examining the value creation and value appropriation opportunities resulting from embedding blockchain onto the supply chain. This study, which is currently in progress, demonstrates the practical benefits and business implications for applying blockchain in an urgent vaccine distribution environment.
