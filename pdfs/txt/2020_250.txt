Online Course of Reading-Writing and Multimedia Application with Virtual Assistants for Schools
ABSTRACT
Reading and writing are important parts of everyone's life as it develops the capacity for reflection, analysis, and synthesis. This paper presents the results of a research project applied to the area of e-learning and multimedia for education. The main goal is to implement an online course for teachers and a multimedia application with virtual assistants focused on strengthening the teaching-learning process of children through reading and writing. We applied the CROA and the OOHDM Methodologies for the design and development of these applications. The results show the satisfaction of students and teachers with regard to the organization and structuring of educational software applications, which significantly improve the reading and writing skills of children between 9 and 12 years of Christian schools that learn principles and human values.
