Determining factors for resistance to the use of mobile banking by Brazilian Internet users aged 45 years or Over
ABSTRACT
In spite of the great potential for the development of mobile banking in Brazil, since the banking index reaches more than half of the population and the number of Internet users is even higher, this potential is not evenly distributed among the age groups in the country. Taking into account the tendency to resist new technologies as one ages, this study aimed to identify the factors which lead the Brazilian population aged 45 years or over to use the Internet and, within this spectrum, identify the percentage of mobile banking users, in order to determine the barriers to the adoption of said technology. A questionnaire was applied and 113 responses were analyzed, categorized between functional and psychological aspects. The results are presented in this work.
