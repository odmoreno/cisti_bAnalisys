Analysis and real-time monitoring of air quality in single-family homes through the use of the time series and business intelligence
ABSTRACT
As cities grow, they begin to suffer from a series of environmental problems, including pollution, which affect human health. The objective of this research is to implement a prototype real-time air quality measurement to determine the degree and environmental pollution factors in single-family homes and to keep the user informed about the current situation of their environment. For this purpose, environmental data were collected in certain dwellings through the measurement experiment, which were stored for analysis, monitoring and timely decision making. Finally, the data collected was analyzed with a tool for Business Analysis and Intelligence (Tableau). These results, resulting from the analysis carried out, can be used in future studies to propose prevention measures against the risks associated with the exposure of pollutants that affect the environment and therefore the good living of people.
