Digital [Business|Transformation] Strategy: A Systematic Review : Could companies benefit from a consolidated road to transformation?
ABSTRACT
New reality imposed by months of quarantine days caused by the global spread of COVID-19 affected mostly every industry. In this new digital age, new technologies are being incorporated continuously introducing new shapes of businesses. Companies able to adapt have a high probability of survival but, even now, digital transformation is still a challenge for traditional nondigital companies. A digital business strategy could guide the inevitable transformations that digital technologies trigger. This paper presents a systematic review of current literature on digital (business and/or transformation) strategies with the objective to identify, evaluate and interpret published research that could bring some light to the relevant aspects and pitfalls that should be considered in a digital transformation initiative. The review investigates what is known about the risks and multi-industry aspects in a digital strategy and the results show statistical data, gaps in current research and models of successful implementation.
