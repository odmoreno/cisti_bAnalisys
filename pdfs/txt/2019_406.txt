Educational Technologies for Brazilian Basic Education
ABSTRACT
The dissemination of the use of technologies in various sectors of society contributes to justify the use also in the area of education. The use of technological artifacts, including robotics, has gained prominence in the educational area due to the possibility of developing low cost prototypes, allowing the use of a larger portion of the school community. Since the pedagogical process can be benefited by the use of artifacts to demonstrate concepts, a research was developed to identify which technologies are or may be appropriate for use in the teaching-learning process in the Brazilian Basic Education. This paper presents the results of the research from the perspective of teachers of this phase of education. From these results, it is possible to guide future work related to the development of pedagogical proposals mediated by these technologies, mainly related to the use of demonstration artifacts.
