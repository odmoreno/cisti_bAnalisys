Experimental Learning and Enhanced Learning Environments the Case of Business Simulators
ABSTRACT
Experiential learning is a pedagogical method that allows the student to consolidate technical competences and develop soft skills, needed in order to be employable in the society 4.0. One possible solution to be used in this experiential learning is the business simulation. It comprises a series of activities that simulates a real business environment. In this risk-free environment, the student experiences what is life in a real company. He applies the technical competences while developing the soft skills such as communication, negotiation, leadership, problem-solving, among others. In this communication we describe a business simulation used in a higher education institution in Portugal. We analyse this simulation in terms of experiential learning and draw some reflections about the results.
