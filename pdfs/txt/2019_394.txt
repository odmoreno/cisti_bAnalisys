The futility or the business of love in the times of the digital era. The economic business of the cyberdating platforms
ABSTRACT
Just like Narcissus of the 21st century, we, bewildered and amazed with our reflection like this, we build, create, recreate and represent our identity in the platforms focused on “finding love”. In this way, millions of people throwing themselves as in to the waters of Internet, in the search for their better half. Sadly what Orwell did not see in his work “1984”, nor Huxley in “A Happy World”, was we ourselves would buy our cameras and that we ourselves, we would even pay to be observed. The following text intend to reflect on digital platforms whose purpose is “dating” or finding a partner, and as these are part of a larger accumulation process, where the economic benefits of paying these sites throughout the last years have gone in crescendo. In another hand, it has led to a digitalization of the self and feelings.
