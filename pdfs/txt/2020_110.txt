A Multi-Parameter Comparative Study of MANET Routing Protocols
ABSTRACT
The process of selecting the routing protocols is one of the most critical choices to be made during the design of an advert hoc network Several things are essential to be known to choose the route correctly. Simulators are a way of testing the system. Network researchers may use other simulation methods performance like OPNET (optimized Network Engineering Tool), NS-2 (Network Simulator version 2) and NS-3 (Network Simulator Version 3) in addition to many other simulation programs and tools. In this paper, we have used NS-2.35 for simulation. By using different routing protocols, we have measured and compared our results and were able to Figure out throughput, average end delay, PDR, and Nodes energy residual using the Random mobility model. The simulation results showed that the AODV routing protocol has been more efficient in terms of its performance than other routing protocols.
