A proposal to provide automated information technology infrastructure with integrated service catalog
ABSTRACT
The main objective of this article is to create a service catalog aiming the possibility to automate the availability in an IT (Information Technology) infrastructure, aligning the serves' virtualization concepts and infrastructure management tools. This work emerged from the analysis on the problems regarding the services availability in the IT infrastructure. This article demonstrates that the use of virtualized environment, with a standard services catalog and specific infrastructure management tools, provides a time saving, reducing the request interval to a new Server from several days to a few hours.
