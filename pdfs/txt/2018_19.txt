Argumentative scheme in academic texts: Algorithm for generating questions on arguments
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to present how a computational algorithm can generate questions from a main clause over an argument of the grammar sentences of an academic text. The process method starts get a text from academic repositories. An available computational application on electronic address (website) do partition the text into words and grammar sentences A database where a partitioned text will be stored will contain features of the words in grammatical meanings of morphology and semantics, and the characteristics of the grammar sentences from equalized connections with types of arguments. As result, this algorithm will show additional issues of pronouns or adverbs of the types of arguments found in the grammar sentence through sequencers of the source text, such as: conjunctions, logical and argumentative operators.
