Immersive Learning: Metaversos e Jogos Digitais na Educação
ABSTRACT
This paper, from a reflection about Digital Culture and the new learners, presents and discusses the use of Metaverses and Digital Games in Education, involving concepts such as flow state, experimentation and meaning to problematize the issue of learning. In this context, we propose the Immersive Learning - i-Learning, using Virtual Reality Experience and Real Virtuality Experiences, as one of the educational possibilities that can be afforded to the new learners, which are part of the Digital Culture.
