End to end distance measurement algorithms in biology sequences
ABSTRACT
Biological information inside the DNA allows many characteristics variations. The translation of DNA from cells into sequences, is a very demanding computational process, which over the last decades biologists try to decode and understand. Search and match algorithms, mostly oriented to fuzzy search, are essential to define the structural biological sequences, and finding similarities. This paper revises algorithms used to search and match different types of strings. Our study show the complexity of the algorithms, and experimental results show that Boyer Mores algorithm is good, with 91% accuracy and 61 seconds of processing time. On the other hand, Brute Force algorithm was not so good, with 40% accuracy and 147 seconds of processing time.
