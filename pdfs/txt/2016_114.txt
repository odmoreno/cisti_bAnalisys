Health translations: A crowdsourced, gamified approach to translate large vocabulary databases
ABSTRACT
The health domain is rich in specific vocabulary and information structures. Previous work on this area includes the collection of this information in information systems. However, the language of these can limit their use. To overcome this, we present Health Translations, a web application that uses crowd-sourcing to translate a large vocabulary set that, currently, is only available in English. To increase usage, gamification methods are applied that reward both the quantity of collaboration and the quality of it. When completed, these translations can be made available without costs to the research community. This paper presents the platform as a responsive web application.
