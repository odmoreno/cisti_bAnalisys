Semantic System for Controlling Non Structured Business Processes Integrated with Scrum : Case study of a contemporary newsroom
ABSTRACT
Work environments need to manage more information as quickly and efficiently as possible within a context susceptible to sudden changes. These tasks depend on knowledge-intensive decisions dependent on the interaction between multiple agents, and can be described by unstructured business processes. An information system that performs an efficient semantic definition for each stage of the decision-making procedure in a process under the context of agile methodology becomes a good way of providing assistance, performing the integration between humans and machines in the work environment and resulting in the persistence of important data at process execution time. To achieve this objective, a prototype of an information system is formulated based on a realistic case study (contextualizing contemporary journalistic writing) defined in terms of an ontology that describes a knowledge-intensive business process.
