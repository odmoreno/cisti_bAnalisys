Semi-automatic user stories generation: To measure user experience
ABSTRACT
User satisfaction with a certain product is affected by its usability and additional factors, such as user experience (UX) that determine if an application meets users' expectations. The quantitative measurement of UX relies on the fulfillment of psychological needs that can be addressed in user stories in order to create a context for a certain experience with a particular application. In this work, we present a framework to semi-automatically generate user stories to measure UX. Our character-centric approach consists of multiple agents that pursue goals and are able to express emotions. Additionally, we introduce a supportive agent that is in charge of generating a strong story line. The framework allows for further extension with avatars that give form to the character agents, and also story generation output in the form of video or comics that complement the current text generation.
