Using information technologies in professional defence education â€” Classification of training with help of effective punching mass
ABSTRACT
This article is focused on a professional defence and on a classification of training. During our research, we tried to find out if it is possible to connect information technologies with learning of the professional defence for more effective results. The aim of this experiment was to find a new possibility of effective classification of training. From previous experiments in this area we had measurements of force of striking techniques (we chose a direct punch as the first technique for a measuring). Based on this force we tried to find effective classification of training. We have the classification with the help of a velocity and an impulse from the past. In this article we present our new method - the classification with the help of an effective punching mass.
