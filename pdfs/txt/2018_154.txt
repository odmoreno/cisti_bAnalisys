Automation prototype applied to the process of packaging water drums of the VillonacoWater Plant
ABSTRACT
The growing consumption of bottled water is the result of the lack of healthiness of the water provided by the company that distributes drinking water. In our environment the consumption of bottled water is the healthiest option for users. Therefore it is necessary that there are enough water purification plants in the locality, so that its production can supply the growing demand, however local companies have a manual and inefficient process. Based on the above, the design of an architecture of an automation system is proposed, which has two main functions: 1) control the level of liquid in the main storage tank, and 2) automate the process of packing the commercial drums by means of time-based dosing. The proposed system is based on an embedded system whose core is the ATMega32A microcontroller, float level sensors and an actuator system based on electrovalves. The performance of the prototype of the automation system was satisfactory since it avoided 100% of stockouts and overshoots of the liquid. In addition, the correction constants of the fluid dosing process were generated in order to obtain errors of less than 5% of the nominal volume of commercial water drums.
