Effects of social media on structural social capital and subjective well-being : Insights from a review of the literature
ABSTRACT
In recent years, the presence of digital and the use of online interaction platforms and tools has become widespread, inducing a transformation in the way in which social relationships are developed and maintained. The aim of this article is to carry out a review of the state of the art regarding the effects of social media on structural social capital, that is, on the individual's network of relationships, which is useful for the purpose of generating resources, instrumental and expressive. For this, and after a conceptual incursion into the motives of social capital and social media, the effects that the literature collects for bonding social capital (network of strong ties) and bridging social capital (network of weak ties) are analyzed, considering the influence it radiates on subjective well-being. With certain nuances, sometimes relevant, it is possible to point out a general positive influence of the social media in both spheres.
