Developing integrated research in Historical Science : Transdisciplinary strategies for information management and exploitation
ABSTRACT
Studies focused on the formation and consolidation of Feudal System in early medieval landscapes have occasionally resulted in a contradictory analysis of the phenomenon over the past decades. Some models for the understanding of this period have been built upon written vestiges and some others raised from the archaeological record, thus establishing parallel but disconnected discourses that, actually, interpret and theorize about the same concepts. Our research aims at providing the essential mechanisms that would permit scholars (re)construct this past, thus creating a common ground for information (that is traditionally) gathered and organized from different disciplines. In defining them, the main elements of data modelling and historical information management will be highlighted in order to address the formation of Castilian Feudalism phenomenon at the Upper Arlanza Basin (Burgos, Spain).
