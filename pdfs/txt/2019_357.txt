Framework for the Adaptation of the Characteristics of the Rhetoric to the Construction Elements of the Video Game
ABSTRACT
Much of contemporary culture is defined through narrative forms [1]. Videogames subvert our traditional notion of narrative, since the elements that help us create it are not organized in the same way as in the traditional narrative. Therefore, first of all we will know what a narration is and how it is constructed. The next phase will be to know how the human being thinks, determining which are the elements that most influence their thinking, highlighting among them the emotion and empathy, both fundamental elements for the creation of a persuasive discourse. And both in deep relationship with the way in which the player relates to the game (Engage) Next, we will work on the elements of rhetoric and its relationship with persuasion. The fit of all the pieces of the puzzle will allow us to establish the bases for the definition of a framework that we can use when identifying the persuasion possibilities of the games and how it can be applied to the construction of them.
