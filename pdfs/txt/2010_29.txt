Ontology-based system for content management in Digital Television: System with media content extraction and ontology-based storage functionalities
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Digital Television offers a wide variety of contents to the viewers. All these contents and their associated information are sent to the user's decoders. But the way this information is managed does not allow us to create a suitable organization of the data. It's necessary to define more powerful data structures that support new and useful functionalities for the viewer. The main objective in this research is to define the specification for an ontology-based content system that optimizes the way the viewer accesses to the data. First, this system reads the information that is contained in the transport stream. Then, it arranges and storages all the data using ontologies, adding information from other sources when necessary. Finally it allows the user to perform searches and offers him recommendations according to his preferences.
