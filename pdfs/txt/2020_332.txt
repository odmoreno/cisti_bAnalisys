EA in the Digital Transformation of Higher Education Institutions
ABSTRACT
Digital transformation (DT) is the widest term used to describe an intensive approach to effective development of new processes and organizations, based on digital technologies, new tools, and best business practices. Such transformation of business is a challenge today's organizations are faced with, and Higher Education Institutions (HEI) are no exception. Enterprise Architecture (EA) is the expression of the main strategies of an organization in terms of business, applications and technologies, and the impact they have on its processes and functions. However, despite the benefits of EA, and its possible role in DT, the way organizations can take advantage of EA in DT is yet poorly explored. This paper takes up a previous proposal of a methodology that promotes EA planning as a tool for DT and applies it in the digital transformation of a HEI. As such, we validate the previously proposed approach, and the two phases of development, which will contribute to placing EA as a tool for solving the problems of HEI digital transformation initiatives.
