DKD-S: An Ontology-based Tool for Global Software Development
ABSTRACT
The Global Software Development has brought an opportunity to software companies to expand the business and market share, also given them the possibility of work with geographically dispersed teams, capitalizing on the advantages of this approach. However, this manner of developing software creates some new challenges, for instance, there is a lack of a formal and normalized model of a software project's data, and artifacts available in a coherent and easy access way for all members involved. The lack of this model makes it difficult for the project members to communicate, understand each other and what is specified on the project's artifacts. Then, this paper proposes a knowledge management tool that utilizes a domain-specific ontology for distributed development environments, intending to help distributed teams to overcome the challenges delivered by the distributed software development model, proposing techniques and best practices. The main result of this research is an ontology-based system to support the software development process with distributed teams.
