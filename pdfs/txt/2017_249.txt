Sistemas e tecnologias de informação e comunicação nas forças policiais
ABSTRACT
The objective of this article is to demonstrate the importance of the Systems and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) in the police forces, in general, and, in the European Gendarmerie, in particular. In fact, the new challenges related to the integration of STIC into the security management promoted by the police forces amplify the technological process, requiring a greater revision of the operational, strategic and management paradigms of the police forces. In this sense, the society benefits from new forms of communication, either through social networks or through the availability of online content and services, according to the characteristics of real-time speed of the information process. Thus, on the one hand, the citizen who is more exposed to the criminal reality, is also more protected. On the other hand, the police forces obtain information faster and because they have a security management tool, they can act effective and efficiently. Methodologically, in the theoretical analysis, this article is supported in the strategy of social responsibility integrated with the policy of disclosure of the police forces, in the perspective of citizenship and accountability. In the empirical analysis it reflects the good practices in this field of each police force integrated in EUROGENDFOR. The results of the article show that the police forces promote greater transparency of information to the citizen, as well as develop the proximity between the police forces oriented to their needs.
