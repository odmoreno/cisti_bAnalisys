ABSTRACT
This paper presents a comparison of the most frequently used mobile commerce services according to the characteristics of the Killer Apps. After this, we focused the study on one of the mobile payment systems that offers more security for the purchase through mobile devices: mobile payment system based on 2D barcodes. A background study was made to evaluate the impact that m-commerce services can have now and in the future, in an economic perspective. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the characteristics of the system, very useful for a layman, and the advantages over other mobile payment systems. Another contribution that results from this work is an analysis of the results of the surveys carried out amongst college students. Through their responses we have been able to determine the advantages of this system compared to other mobile micro-payment systems.
