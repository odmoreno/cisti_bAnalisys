“Intelligent” adaptive learning objects applied to special education needs: Extending the eLearning paradigm to the uLearning environment
ABSTRACT
The use of computers and the Internet have changed classic methods of teaching and Learning, introducing the concept of distance Learning as a great opportunity for studying unfettered by constraints of time and space [1]. In addition, acquisition of new skills and knowledge is not only affected by an individual's mental schemes or beliefs, but also by their interaction, cooperation and collaboration with others [1]. This perspective fits e.g. in teaching blind and deaf people alongside of children with special educational needs. The aim of the research developed until the moment was to prove that the full integration of the concept of teaching/learning in the light of Feuerstein and Gardner theories is advantageous in this specific field has been proved with children without difficulties [2]. The proposed architecture is based on an intelligent structure supported by Chi-square and a Genetic Algorithm - the evaluation block - supported in a special structured Learning Object, named Knowledge Block - the information and knowledge block [2]. This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) It presents an adaptive system to improve special educational needs; (2) Extends the paradigm to new fields of education as is the special educational needs; (3) Uses a non-linear “thinking” conducting to a correct learning path based on individual special needs of each subject in study; (4) Extends our research paradigm to the ULearning environment.
