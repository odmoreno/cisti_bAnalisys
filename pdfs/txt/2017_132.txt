Methods of comparison and similarity scoring for electrical current waveforms
ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to identify methods that may be applied in the calculation of similarity between waveforms. Five methods were selected: the Pearson correlation coefficient, the phi coefficient, the Bhattacharyya distance, the Spearman correlation coefficient and the Root Mean Square Deviation. To apply the methods in calculating the similarity between waveforms, a time shift was implemented. To validate the methods of analysis and define the similarity score between waveforms were captured and used waveforms of five electromedical equipment. The conducted tests showed that the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients may be applied to assess the similarity between electrical current waveforms. To determine the degree of similarity between waveforms a scale of five-degree of similarity was produced. The classification of similarity between waveforms, based on the scale, can be used to detect cases of microshocks.
