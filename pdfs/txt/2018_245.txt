Interrupt the TV emission: Usage evaluation in real context
ABSTRACT
Technology application in citizens' lives is a reality and the potential of these solutions are increasingly used to benefit individuals to enhance their quality of life. To have a real impact on users' lives it is important that the products are built with potential end users, in order to meet their needs and expectations. In the scope of +TV4E project, which aims to develop an interactive television platform for broadcasting information on public and social services, the way to interrupt the television transmission for content presentation can determine the successful use of this solution. This article reports the work carried out with a group of seniors through a field test, developed in their natural context, for two weeks. Over this time, two ways of injecting videos were checked. This test was preceded by a participatory design session where this question was also evaluated in a laboratory context.
