Formal Specification and Validation of a Gas Detection System in the Industrial Sector
ABSTRACT
In gas concentrations greater than the allowable amounts, these become an imminent danger. It is true that there are devices that already read information, but are intended exclusively for the mining sector and are very expensive. That is why we propose to model and validate a new system for other industrial sectors. Our proposal, The Gas Detection System is based on The Explosive Discussion Triangle method developed by Coward and Jones. We use this method to develop a control system that will allow gas concentrations to be detected in a given environment and send an alarm if a risk situation arises. Formal Specifications allows the use of mathematical notations that help in the process of implementing critical systems and helps to reduce the potential ambiguities that occur in the interpretation of traditional graphic models. This work uses the VDM ++ formal specification language to describe system properties for its subsequent modeling and validation through the VDMToolBox tool. The System architecture is based on sensors, a control module and a set of alarms. Our proposal makes use of formal specifications in order to validate the main properties of the functional requirements.
