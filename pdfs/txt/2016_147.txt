Main influence factors for maturity of hospital information systems
ABSTRACT
The maturity models are facilitating instruments of organizational management, including the management of information systems (IS) function, not being execption hospital organizations. This article presents a study conducted with a group of experts from the field of the Hospital Information Systems (HIS) to identify the main influence factors that should be present in a comprehensive maturity model for the management of HIS. The development of this model takes place within a doctoral project and is justified to the extent that current maturity models in the field of HIS management are still in an early development stage, and especially because they are poorly detailed, do not provide tools to determine the maturity stage nor structure the characteristics of maturity stages according to different influencing factors.
