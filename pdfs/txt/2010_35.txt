Quality in the development of applications through the team software process TSPi methodology
ABSTRACT
This article describes a case study based on the TSPi application. The data used for this case were obtained from 34 teams of fourth course's students from the Faculty of Computer Sciences, Technical University of Madrid. The teams involved in this study worked on the development of the same project, which has been carried on through 2 separate cycles. The data available were used to perform an exploratory analysis of the different phases of the TSPi life cycle, specifically the deviation between the estimated and the real elimination of defects, the density of the defects, and the yield (percentage of defects eliminated before each phase) of the defects. Finally, the analysis of results is represented by comparing both cycles as well as proposals of improvement.
