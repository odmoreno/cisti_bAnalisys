Linear Algebra and Image Processing: A New Teaching Approach
ABSTRACT
Linear Algebra is one of the main mathematical fields, which is used in many technical subjects. Inability to realize the importance of Linear Algebra and its applications in technical subjects is one of the reasons of poor academic performance of students. The typical teaching approach separates the Linear Algebra's from technical subject. This does not necessarily promote student's awareness in both subjects. This paper presents a new teaching approach which combine Linear Algebra and Image Processing contents. The methodology presented is based in teaching Linear Algebra contents such as matrices and matrix transformation using Image Processing applications. This could lead to a whole new interesting learning environment, new teaching approaches that are more stimulating for students and more productive and dynamic for teachers.
