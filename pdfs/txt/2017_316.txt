Translation system of voice and text to language of signs
ABSTRACT
Incorporating the use of information technology and communication in everyday life is increasingly necessary, especially when it comes to improving aspects that affect the living conditions of people with disabilities. This paper describes the first stage of an investigation that the development of a translator system text to voice and sign language aims to improve the communication process of people with hearing disabilities with people without hearing impairment. The system must integrate: 1) technology of smartphones through a software application that captures signals voice or text typed by a user and translate to its corresponding symbol of sign language that people use with this disability in the city of Latacunga - Ecuador, and 2) a robotic hand that captures the signals sent from the phone and imitate the sign translated by the application. The result of this stage is the application software for mobile phones, it has been tested and validated by a group of twenty users without hearing impairment and interest in learning sign language, who responded affirmatively to the operation and performance the application through a test that was designed based on ISO 9241-11 which provides guidance for measuring the quality of a software product. In this way it is possible to proceed to the next stage of the investigation, following which it must be checked whether the system actually helps the process of communication for people with hearing disabilities with people who are listeners.
