Data Analysis using Business Intelligence in the educational context
ABSTRACT
This article displays the use of business intelligence as a technology for data analysis in the educational context. An applied investigation of the architecture of a business intelligence (BI) solution for tracking academic credits is carried out. The integration of different technologies such as Microsoft SQL Server 2019, Visual Studio 2019 (Integration Services) and Microsoft Excel 2016 (Power Pivot) allow the implementation of the case study. The benefits of the proposal are innumerable, since it can be easily adapted to the characteristics of the requirements for the analysis in each particular situation. Also, it can be mentioned in the use of indicators for data analysis such as academic advising, tutoring, scholarships, social service and professional practices, graduates, graduates, academic achievement, dropouts, income, among many others. With this, a broad line of investigation of business intelligence in the educational context with the application of emerging technologies for data analysis is envisioned.
