Itâ€™s a Fraud : Learning about Cybersecurity
ABSTRACT
The impetus for this work was to study cybersecurity knowledge and the gamification impact. Joining the two themes, the video game "It's a Fraud" was developed in 2D using Unity version 2019.4.21f1 open-source tool, to raise awareness of the problem of Internet security and apply the incentives that gamification offers.Through questionnaires it was gauged both the behavior and the previous knowledge about gamification and cybersecurity, thus, the game was developed with the assumption of sensitizing players to safety and security on the Internet. Some of the cyber threats were used as enemies, accompanied by an explanation of how to combat such a threat.After the implementation of the "It's a Fraud" game, its distribution was accompanied by a survey, which proved both learning and increased attention to the topic of internet security.
