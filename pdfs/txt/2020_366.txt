Cultural Tourism in Social Media, the paradigm of the Camino de Santiago Franc√©s
ABSTRACT
The adaptation to the new scenario that the Social media project has revolutionized the way of communicating, which is why tourist destinations must take advantage of the advantages they offer as a communication tool. For this reason, the communities where El Camino de Santiago, a millennial pilgrimage route that has gone from a purely religious fact to become a tourist product, can use these resources to carry out its promotion. The objective of this work is to analyze the activity and effectiveness of the official Facebook fanpage s of the organisms of the autonomous communities through which the French Way of Saint James passes in Spain for its tourism promotion: Navarre, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-Leon and Galicia. For this purpose, the variables of Presence/Visibility, Engagement/Interactivity and Content are considered and are measured through a series of performance indicators using the online analysis tool Fanpage Karma%. The results reveal that some of the regions analyzed should better optimize the interactive potential that Facebook offers them, to improve their future positioning as a tourist destination.
