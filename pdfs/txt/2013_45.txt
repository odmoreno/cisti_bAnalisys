GIS2R — Augmented reality and 360° panoramas framework for geomarketing
ABSTRACT
Recent developments in the areas of augmented reality, 360° panoramas, social networks and geographical information systems enable the development of new solutions, which can contribute to several areas. This paper presents a new, Uni-ty3D [8] based framework for the development of immersive augmented reality solutions and 360° panoramas. This solution allows the aggregation of spatial information from disparate and heterogeneous sources, comprising the visualization of points of interest (POIs), image overlays (photographs), 3D objects and navigation between panoramas. This framework also features a strong multiplatform (web and mobile) component, and the possibility of developing new functional modules that can be easily plugged in. A prototype based on this solution, for geomarketing, is also presented.
