OpenEHR aware multi agent system for inter-institutional health data integration
ABSTRACT
Most patients receive care from many health care providers, and consequently their health data is dispersed over many institutions' paper and EHR-based record systems. This reality leads to a fragmented system of storing and retrieving essential patient data that impedes optimal care leading to the coexistence of somewhat autistic systems. Providing means for scattered clinical information to be congregated where and when needed may have a strong impact on healthcare quality. Interoperability is a major requisite for effectively sharing information between systems. Standards like openEHR play an important role on achieving interoperability. Agents are software entities, which can embody different perspectives of the surrounding environment and act accordingly. They can perceive the dynamic character of the environment and update their knowledge, enabling pro-activeness regarding actions that are better suited according to a particular user and a given set of goals. In this work we extend our previous work of building a VEPR for inter-institutional data integration with the inclusion of openEHR usage for querying and storing data in order to pursuit the efforts towards Health Information Systems semantic interoperability.
