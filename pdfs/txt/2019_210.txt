Internet of Things Electromechanical Method and Device for New or Installed Gas Stoves: Making Home Safier
ABSTRACT
Electronic devices have been dabbled into houses to perform automatic tasks and fulfill different needs such as illumination, cooking, air conditioning, surveillance, among others. Furthermore, those elements can collect data from the environment in order to be processed and give better products and services, so, Internet of Things capabilities arises to home, highly cohesive with domotics. However, for developing countries, smart appliances are expensive, and old fridges, washing machines, etc., are still operative, so they must not to be discarded. Other very used appliances are stoves, which work with heating methods like electrical resistances, electrical induction or natural gas. The last one is the most used in a plenty of countries, due to its advantages regarding cost, for instance. Nonetheless, bad manipulation can cause gas leakages, and furthermore, injuries to people and conflagrations, affecting human lives and assets. Thus, a need has been identified regarding gas safety of gas stoves, conserving the installed base. This work shows the results of the main research and design considerations of a new cutting-edge technology that protects people of bad manipulation of already installed or new gas stoves, including the Internet of Things in order to monitor in real-time possible gas leakages and take actions.
