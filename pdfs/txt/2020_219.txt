Turing Project: An Open Educational Game to Teach and Learn Programming Logic
ABSTRACT
The paper proposes an open educational game, for students who have never had contact or who present some difficulty in programming logic. The game, in a playful and fun way, tries to teach the basics of programming logic for the students, allowing the same to acquire knowledge during the gameplay. The game proposed in this paper is called “Turing Project”, a RPG game, in which the student will play the role of the game's hero. By collecting scrolls, items and performing missions, students are expected to learn the concepts related to the logic of programming. A subjective experiment was carried out via a survey with 19 users and the main conclusions points out that students had good experiences during the game, which had positive impact in their learning.
