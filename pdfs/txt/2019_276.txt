PAPR Reduction Based on Partial Transmit Sequence Technique in UFMC Waveform
ABSTRACT
In this paper, the partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique known as one of the most efficient peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes is applied to the recently proposed fifth generation (5G) waveform candidate called universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC) for PAPR reduction process. Thanks to our way of application in which the PTS technique is employed before the process of subdividing the bandwidth into the number of sub-bands, the PAPR minimization is carried out in a very simple and efficient manner. In the simulations, the PAPR reduction performance of the PTS technique is analyzed for different search numbers (SNs). In addition, the effect of PTS on the power spectral density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) performance of the UFMC system employing solid state power amplifier (SSPA) as a high power amplifier (HPA) is investigated for different input back off (IBO) and smoothness coefficient (p) values.
