Knowledge-Intensive Services for Regional Innovation
ABSTRACT
Innovation stills on the world's agenda as the holy grail of business success. Nevertheless, it stills hard for some communities to understand and embrace innovation processes in a systematic way as a continuum for regional development. Our stance is that innovation seeds, feeds innovation. That means, innovation won't work in a closed cycle, but rather in an open and cross-entity manner, forming a knowledge-managed regional development ecosystem. Accordingly, this paper describes a knowledge lab, designed as an intel structure to offer knowledge-intensive services towards the regional development of the “Tâmega e Sousa” (NUTIII) Region. This knowledge lab aims at complementing the installed dynamics on innovation support and economic stimulus in a knowledge-based innovation management approach.
