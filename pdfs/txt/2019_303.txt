Enhancing Learnings with Internet of Things: PAprICa project
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is considered an emerging technology in relation to which an impact on society is considered comparable to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century. In educational contexts its potential results essentially from the ability to amplify access to relevant information to the construction of knowledge based on the specific context of the user. In this doctoral research, it's intended to study the use of IoT in the theoretical and practical dimensions, as a didactic resource to promote interdisciplinary learnings in educational contexts of the 3rd Cycle of Basic Education (7th to 9th grade), with emphasis on the programmatic contents of Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Geography, Physics and Chemistry.
