Structuring the COBIT 5 goals cascade in the context of ICT governance in DPU/Brazil
ABSTRACT
IT governance ensures that the needs, conditions, and choices of stakeholders are decisive of IT planning. To reflect on such planning and to enable the implementation of IT governance, can be used the framework: COBIT 5. The COBIT 5 Goals Cascade translates these needs into customized, achievable and specific institutional objectives. Innovation Processes, such as Design Thinking, are typically used to stimulate creativity with a central focus on the stakeholders. This process can also be employed to assist in the implementation process. This paper reports a case study on the construction of the Goals Cascade of the Department of Information Technology from Federal Public Defender (STI/DPU) â€” Federal department of Brazil. During the process, instruments, maps and validation meetings were developed with the agency's managers. In less than a year, it was possible to structure the cascade which allied with the application of the techniques of Design Thinking allowed the revision of IT planning to reach an IT position in a more strategic way.
