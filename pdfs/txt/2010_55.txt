Assessing the quality of scientific publications as educational content on digital libraries
ABSTRACT
In recent years, new projects and research lines in several scientific areas have emerged in order to develop and improve the process of teaching/learning within the network of universities in Cuba. From a general viewpoint, applying information and communication technologies on the management of the information generated by higher education processes stimulates the use of digital libraries. In this paper, we aim at applying the LOQEVAL (Learning Object Quality EVALuation) proposal, which is based on the intensive use of ontologies, for assessing the quality of scientific publications as educational contents. The paper explains the whole process of assessment using the use case of the digital library of the Agrarian University of Havana, which is currently under development.
