Proactive Personal Assistant in the Context of the Television Ecosystem
ABSTRACT
Nowadays technological developments give rise to the creation of increasingly improved digital devices that end up being present in countless contexts. In this sense, the integration of personal assistants (PAs) in devices such as the smartphone, proves to be one of these important developments. Alongside these new developments, technological devices that have been in existence for many years, such as television (TV), continue to be of great importance. In this article it is proposed a proactive PA for the TV ecosystem, aiming to understand the advantages of combining these two contexts, thus contributing both to the TV ecosystem and to the context of proactive personal assistance.
