Criminal management in Praia, Cape Verde
ABSTRACT
This short article presents a spatial analysis of crime in the city of Praia, Santiago, Cape Verde. Its key feature of this research lies in the generation of solid surfaces considering the georeferenced locations of crimes and the existing police stations. Using the thematic maps generated by IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted) interpolation, it is expected that this simulation can serve as a model for police management in the near future, including the location of future stations.
