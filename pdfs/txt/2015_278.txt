Online local media's strategies for social networks: The case of La Voz de Galicia
ABSTRACT
The industry of traditional media has completely changed its attitude towards generalist social networks. Although initially media have acted as simple observers when social networks appeared and became popular, at present they have incorporated these networks to their policy strategies, both for the dissemination of information and for the daily work. The reasons have been the constant increase of users visits (which in some cases exceeds 50% of unique visitors), and the strong belief that social networks have come to stay. These virtual streets forming the cyberspace have emerged as the main scenario in the functioning of the current ecosystem of communication, and also in a good part of the strategies of economic, social, and political actors. Moreover, this has directly contributed to the construction of a new culture marked by the impact of these networks. The present paper analyses the changes that have taken place in online media, selecting La Voz de Galicia as a test case.
