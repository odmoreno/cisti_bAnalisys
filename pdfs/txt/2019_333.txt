ICT in the Promotion of the Older Adults' Quality of Life in Portugal
ABSTRACT
In an increasingly aging and at the same time more technological society, it is essential to carry out studies, projects and initiatives that promote the quality of life of older citizens. The SEDUCE 2.0 Project is one of those examples that, in addition to developing the online social community miOne, aims to study the impact of its use on older adults' psychosocial variables - quality of life, perceived stress and social support networks. Thus, this paper aims to analyze what kind of studies have already been carried out, what methodology and what sample are used, results and what limitations and gaps are found, in order to provide guidelines for the Project. A systematic literature review has been done, structured from original publications, dated from 2008 to 2019 and based on the concepts: quality of life, information and communication technologies, older adults, aging and active aging. Although there were few studies, the results identify that is important to pay particular attention to the selection and distribution of the participants by groups and to the size of the sample. In addition, they reinforce the positive relationship between the use of technologies and the maintenance or improvement of quality of life, reduction of the feeling of loneliness, and promotion of active aging.
