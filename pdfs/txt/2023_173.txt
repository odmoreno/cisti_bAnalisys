A Teacher-Focused Impact Assessment in Scratch4All Project
ABSTRACT
The “Scratch4All” project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.
