Integration model for collaborative learning in Covid-19 times : Validation of the Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey (COLLES)
ABSTRACT
Collaborative learning is an essential part of a new educational approach, characterized by social isolation and virtual learning experiences because of Covid-19. The objective of this work was to validate an integration model for collaborative learning mediated by the LMS - blackboard collaborate, from the application of the Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey (COLLES), an instrument with 24 items and 6 factors, which assesses specifically online learning. An exploratory analysis was used to establish the reliability and adequacy of the factors with the items of the questionnaire, then a confirmatory analysis was carried out using the Modeling of Structural Equations with Partial Least Squares PLS-SEM. The study was carried out with 347 university students, 57.8% being men and 42.0% women. The results through R2 show that the influence of the support of the tutor/professor in the interpretation of the contents is 52.6%; followed by relevance with 22.1%; the influence on the development of reflective thinking with 20.4%; the influence of the Tutor/professor in supporting peers to promote a favorable integration environment represents 12.8% of the variance explained by the model. It is concluded that the Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey (COLLES) allows the validation of an integration model for collaborative online learning in times of Covid-19.
