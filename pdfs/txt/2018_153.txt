Misinformation became pervasive on social media applications. The companies behind this kind of system have launched tools to avoid the problem, but some issues regarding the user behavior and proper software quality still need a forceful approach. First attempts to mitigate misinformation did not take into account user behavior and softwares requirements like learnability and accuracy, furthermore the characteristics of actors and artifacts from social media applications ecosystem has not been explored. This research aims to evaluate the usability of available tools made to combat the spread of misinformation and to verify the interrelationship between actors and artifacts from social media applications ecosystem for suggesting improvements on development of these tools.
