Measurement of materials emissivity supported by image software
ABSTRACT
Infrared Thermography (IRT) is a temperature measurement technique based on radiation detection in the IR spectrum. Thus, it is used as a non-destructive diagnostic technique, with non-contact, to evaluate the surface temperature of objects based on the emitted radiation. The surface temperature field is carried out using an image that reproduces colour patterns. Since it is a non-destructive technique, versatile, and with non-contact, constitutes a very useful tool in various fields. However, accurate measurement of temperature is strongly dependent on the emissivity value of the material. Active or passive heating procedures may be used. This paper presents a methodology for measuring the emissivity of materials supported by image software. The method proved to be very adequate and the results show an effective contribution in this respect, especially for application in active thermography.
