Information technology and collaborative work: Key elements in scientific productivity
ABSTRACT
The development of science and technology has always been an important occupation in the life of human beings, these activities can be defined as public activities that require the development of collective efforts, which will achieve most significant results. For those dedicated to education and research, we see the establishment of relationships with colleagues working on similar projects with similar research lines or works that enrich or complement their projects, this can generate bigger and better results in scientific and academic productivity. Do these work modes can be considered collaborative work? This paper describes the results of an investigation that aimed to identify academic and research productivity of teachers, researchers and correlation with participation in various research groups, which have the characteristics of a collaborative working group. The study was conducted with a mixed research methodology, of a correlational, descriptive, transactional. The population considered was the official national register of researchers of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), attached to educational institutions and research institutes in the state of Baja California. We designed a stratified probability in which were defined in three main investigators, one for each of the cities (Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada).
