Digital Marketing in Wine Tourism - The case of Quinta do Sobreiró de Cima
ABSTRACT
The wine industry increasingly recognises the role of digital marketing as a valuable and appropriate tool to reach consumers. Producing a good wine is an important part of the job, however it is necessary to give it the presentation it deserves, communicating accurately and keeping in mind that digital marketing activities are constantly evolving, and companies have to adapt. In this sense, the objective of this research is to analyse the digital communication and the use of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) techniques of a company that practices wine tourism. To this end, data were collected in several digital channels of the company Quinta do Sobreiró de Cima, such as Facebook, Instagram and website.
