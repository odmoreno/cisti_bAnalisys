Strategic performance measurement systems and employee performance
ABSTRACT
This proposed research questions the assumption that strategic performance measurement systems (SPMS) define strategic goals at the individual job level, reducing role ambiguity and ensuring desired employee outcomes. Through qualitative research of both white-collar and blue-collar jobs, we seek to determine the types of jobs most amenable to SPMS guidance.
