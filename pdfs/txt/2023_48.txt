Modeling and Simulation of Electric Vehicle Driveline
ABSTRACT
Electric vehicle drivetrain modeling and simulation is a crucial aspect of electric vehicle design and development. A driveline is responsible for transferring power from the motor to the wheels, and the modeling and simulation process helps optimize the drivetrain design for efficiency, performance and safety. This paper presents in an extended manner the design and mathematical modeling of a dynamic transmission system of an electric vehicle. The mathematical model was simulated in Matlab Simulink and the obtained results were the basis of the implementation of the entire system in a small vehicle with offroad capabilities. This work is part of a larger project that has as its objective the creation of a complete electric vehicle starting from the design part and up to the testing on the roads.
