Business Intelligence application in the allocation of European funds in the Autonomous Region of Madeira : A content analysis proposal about Portugal 2020 funds
ABSTRACT
Portuguese companies have invested heavily in funding through European funds from the Portugal 2020 program, which aims to promote the competitiveness of the regional economy. The allocation of European funds is based on four thematic areas: Competitiveness and Internationalization, Social Inclusion and Employment; Human Capital and Sustainability and Efficiency in the Use of Resources, covered by 16 programs that act in alignment with the goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy. This article aims to demonstrate the applicability of Business Intelligence tools, through a qualitative analysis of projects financed by European funds in the Autonomous Region of Madeira. For this purpose, it was considered the file of approved projects, which contained the summary associated with each, and using the Python language it was possible to extract the keywords of each one. Through this analysis, it was possible to analyze the most common keywords in all projects within these 4 thematic areas. This work is thus a contribution to a better knowledge of the funds approved for the Autonomous Region of Madeira since the beginning of this support program.
