Open source browser-based geoviewer to support water resources planning and management
ABSTRACT
The importance, necessity and complexity associated with water resources planning and management can be facilitated by the design and implementation of information systems based on spatial databases. In this context, this paper presents a case study of a browser-based geoviewer, built on open source software, which provides the access and visualization of geographic databases concerning water resources characterization, planning and management, the query based on alphanumeric and geographic criteria and the execution of simple spatial analysis operations. Finally, overall results are presented concerning the levels of use by users of the functionalities of the developed platform, as well as some considerations on system developments and improvements.
