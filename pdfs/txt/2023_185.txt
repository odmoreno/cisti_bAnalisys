Factors influencing the self-efficacy of online learning in university students
ABSTRACT
The study’s main goal was to find out how academic evaluation and monitoring, student-teacher interaction, and the virtual teaching process affect a person’s sense of self-efficacy in online learning. The research was carried out during the post-pandemic period, with a sample for the study made up of 272 students from a public university in the Arequipa region of Peru. The methodology that was used is no experimental and has two well-defined phases; first, an exploratory factor analysis was performed, which aimed to condense the information in the original variables into smaller series; second, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed, by modelling structural equations based on variances. It is concluded that academic evaluation and monitoring do not positively influence online learning self-efficacy, because the educational model has deficiencies in the online evaluation criteria due to the distrust of teachers and students; However, the student-teacher interaction and virtual teaching process, if they would positively influence the online learning self-efficacy.
