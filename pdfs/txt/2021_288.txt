ABSTRACT
The fight to end gender violence and inequalities between men and women has allowed a new wave to be generated in feminism. It is the fourth wave that, unlike the previous ones, has new communication tools. It is no longer just about marches in the streets and avenues of large cities, today the voice is raised through social networks. The common goal of feminist movements is to end with gender violence that continue to rise. Sexual violence, harassment and femicide are part of the current problems. Through this study, the use, management and impact on the social network Facebook of the movements Me Too, Time's Up and Ni Una Menos, emerged and popularized in social networks, are analyzed.
