Cuckoo-search and Gacha Games Rewards: How Can Improve the Relationship Between Player and Game by Using a Metaheuristic Algorithm?
ABSTRACT
In this paper is proposed to implement a metaheuristic algorithm in the process of obtaining "gacha game rewards". The focus and objective of this study is to be able to find a balance between user satisfaction and the benefit of the company, for which two types of user were used, who cover the characteristics of time spent in the game and how much they have invested in this. For this, an objective function was proposed in which it encompasses the variables related to the user and the company, then the proposed algorithm was adapted to the proposed context. Finally, it was implemented and applied in a game prototype where its operation and performance are compared with a simulator. The proposed goal is to be able to demonstrate that the use of cuckoo search in these types of games.
