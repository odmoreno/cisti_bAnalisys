The communicatives practice of university students from Ecuador, the influence of mass culture and the factors that determine their transmedia narrative
ABSTRACT
This research seeks to reveal how in the transmediality of the messages of the young university students of Ecuador, the communicative practices that in turn drive mass culture are energized. The study was determined in a triangulation that included a four-month cultural netnography, a survey and bibliographic survey, accompanied by in-depth interviews. The investigation determined that mass culture is not a phenomenon that is registered only in the mass media, but, that it is present in the new media and that this time exceeds analog media as content managers of this type and that now Prosumer users, especially young people, are content managers who pay tribute to mass culture..
