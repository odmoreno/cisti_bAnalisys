Proposal for the implementation of an electronic order management and invoicing system for a voice command driven restaurant
ABSTRACT
This research work proposes to design a Smart Card for the ordering and payment process of a restaurant. This seeks to take advantage of SmartThings, which form the core of the Internet of Things. In order to achieve the automation of certain processes, collecting and controlling the data and information of the orders placed through an intelligent system, ensuring the availability and reliability of the information required at any given time. The methodology implemented to carry out this product is the agile scrum methodology since they are very adapted to work on projects in situations where it is preferable to leave open the possibility of partially modifying the requirements established for it when results are obtained. The design of an intelligent computerized ordering system for a restaurant will allow to efficiently manage this process and remotely from your table you can consult by voice command some processes of the order.
