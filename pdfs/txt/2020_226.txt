Collaborative transmedia learning environments for the promotion of studentsâ€™ autonomy and motivation : A study developed with students at risk of dropout and school failure
ABSTRACT
This article reports on a study carried out with vocational education students with a significant risk of failure or dropping out in their school career. Bearing in mind that these students have reduced levels of autonomy and motivation, an action-research plan was designed in which, through a transmedia collaborative approach and using digital technologies, it was intended to act, gradually, in the development of these 2 aspects over 2 research cycles, each with 4 and 2 weeks, respectively. The results obtained in the 1st implementation cycle indicate an improvement in mathematical knowledge. However, there were no statistically significant differences in motivation and autonomy.
