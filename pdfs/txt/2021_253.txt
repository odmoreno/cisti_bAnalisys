BIM's Contribution to Tacit Knowledge Sharing in Construction Projects â€“ A Systematic Review
ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of knowledge management technologies, tacit knowledge initiatives are still immersed in ambiguity in the construction sector. However, some authors consider that the Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology can be an effective repository for knowledge management in the sector. The goal of this article is to conduct a systematic review of relevant literature via two processes: Proknow-C and Methodi Ordinatio. As a result of the application of these two processes, and after the reading of relevant literature, 20 articles published between January 2009 and January 2021 were selected. The goal behind this selection is to promote tacit knowledge sharing in combination with the BIM methodology to optimize construction projects and help project managers to make decisions.
