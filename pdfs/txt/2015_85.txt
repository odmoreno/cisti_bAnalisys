Software documentation quality: A case study for the software documentation of SIGEPE
ABSTRACT
Requirements determine the correct construction of software and are frequently represented explicitly in the accompanying documentation in ways that vary according to the adopted software process. The documentation is typically written in natural language and can contain elements such as figures, tables or a more formal description. The quality assurance of artifacts written in natural language has advanced significantly since the mid-70s. SIGEPE makes use of checklists with criteria weighted by both form and content. The quality assurance team conducts periodic and individual checks on strategically selected projects. In little over a year, there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of the documentation and it was possible to identify the most common points of success and failure. This paper describes a Case Study to verify the quality of the elements of SIGEPE documentation.
