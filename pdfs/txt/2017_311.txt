Acceptability and usability of a computer-based cognitive training program: An exploratory study with community-dwelling older adults
ABSTRACT
Aims: Decline in some cognitive functions has been associated with the ageing process. Computer-based cognitive training programs have been considered as a promising approach to the maintenance and/or improvement of cognitive functions. TV Neurones is a computerized cognitive training program for healthy and cognitive impaired older adults. However, there are currently no validation studies with TV Neurones. This study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of TV Neurones. Specifically, it aimed to analyze its acceptability and satisfaction with usability among community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A cross-sectional exploratory study was conducted with a convenience sample. A questionnaire to assess acceptability and the Portuguese version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to collect data. Data were analyzed through descriptive analysis. Results: Thirty older adults (63,3%female) with a mean age of 67,30±6,67 years old have participated. A global score of 75,50±13,95 was obtained for SUS, indicating a good satisfaction with usability. Concerning acceptability, all the participants have enjoyed using the TV Neurones, considered the exercises as stimulating and the instructions easy to understand, and the program as useful. The majority have reported that TV Neurones allowed to train useful tasks for the daily routines (n=29; 96,7%). However, only 10% of the participants have played more than 10% of the total of games. Conclusions: The TV Neurones have shown good usability and acceptability characteristics. Future research should analyse the impacts of individual and grupal TV Neurones usage on adherence to the program, as well as its effects on older people with cognitive impairment and compare it with more traditional approaches to cognitive training.
