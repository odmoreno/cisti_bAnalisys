The use of Scratch for the development of 21st century learning skills in ICT
ABSTRACT
The present work was developed in an educational context and was introduced into the theme of the practical application in a classroom setting of the subject Tecnologias da Informação e Comunicação - TIC (Information and Communication Technologies - ICT) with 5th and 6th grade students. All the work presented here was based on two premises: the use of Scratch as a tool and the students as producers of media, which in turn developed their creativity, problem solving skills, and augmented their media literacy and critical thinking aptitude. In this plan of action, we considered three phases: in the 1st phase we evaluated several methodologies for introducing Scratch; in the 2nd phase we focused on collaborative learning in small groups; in the 3rd phase the focus was on developing a game with the whole class. For the duration of this study, it was noticeable that the group of students easily adapted to Scratch. We concluded that the use of this tool motivates students and improves the learning process. It also contributes to a higher level of concentration and promotes collaborative learning. Additionally, it facilitates creativity, dialogue and the overall relationship among students. The teacher quickly understood that this tool allowed the shift into a pedagogic model based on the collaborative construction of knowledge. At the end of this paper there are suggestions of strategies that can be adopted in order to work with Scratch in the classroom. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for possible future projects in this area.
