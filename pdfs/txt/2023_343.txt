Collaboration Within Architecture and Structure Based on BIM Platforms
ABSTRACT
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a methodology focused on the centralization and sharing of the project information among all professionals involved, supported on the generation and manipulation of a three-dimensional (3D) digital BIM model. This methodology allows adequate coordination and team collaboration, avoiding conflicts between specialties and data omissions. In the present study, the benefits and limitations identified within the collaboration and integration between structural and architectural professionals, using BIM platforms were analyzed. A structural design case, elaborated within a BIM environment was developed, using the Revit modelling and structural calculation software Robot. The main remarks concerns the fundamental aspects of information sharing, interoperability, and reinforcement detailing. Despite the limitations found, essentially related to the software interoperability, the BIM approach presents significant advantages in structural design.
