Developing Competencies through Learning Objects: A Systematic Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Currently, Engineering careers in Argentina are immersed in a process of paradigm shift towards Learning through Competencies (LC). This presents a new challenge for the assertive development of materials as a complementary activity to the planning of the didactic sequence carried out by the teacher when proposing a learning path. In this work, the authors present the bibliographic review carried out regarding the design of Learning Objects for training in competency environments. As a result, the need to continue researching for the generation of LOs in LC contexts is revealed, given that the applied methodologies contemplate the competencies approach in a limited way, or they do not contain a design that guarantees the alignment of the developed LO with professional competencies.
