SICAP - Cadastral Information and Property Management System
ABSTRACT
The land registry is a fundamental source of information for territorial planning, management, and innovation. Portugal does not have an up-to-date land registry which means that 20% of the Portuguese territory has unknown ownership. In this context, the SICAP platform (Sistema de Informação Cadastral e Administração de Propriedades) is intended to contribute to the availability of useful tools to support the creation and management of land registry, throw the registration of alphanumeric and geographic data of the properties, in accordance with information provided in SICS (Simplified Cadastral Information System) and according to INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) directives, and compatible with the international standard LADM (Land Administration Domain Model). The platform was also complemented with functionalities to perform simple analysis operations and to visualize metrics and statistics of the inserted proprieties data. The usefulness of the platform, in addition to support the management of multiple properties of an entity or association, can facilitate and support online land market operations in the future.
