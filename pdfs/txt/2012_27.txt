Applying Cobit 4.1 to knowledge governance: Matrix ProGOB to control governance objectives
ABSTRACT
Knowledge governance analyses to what extent knowledge processes are influenced by governance mechanisms. A number of advances have been made in this field, but much space remains for research. However, before advancing in this direction, we must have a tool to direct efforts and provide a certain notion of the progress made in research. This paper proposes a matrix that brings knowledge management processes into relation with knowledge governance objectives (ProGOb matrix). This matrix provides information about which knowledge processes affect which governance objectives, and to what extent. The ProGOb matrix can be highly useful in the current tendency towards the Web 2.0, where knowledge distribution requires knowledge governance which has clear objectives and takes specific actions.
