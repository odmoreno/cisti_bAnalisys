Fostering Inclusive Education through Universal Instructional Design
ABSTRACT
Planning a course that promotes inclusive learning effectively is not a simple task. Each student has different learning goals and specific needs in relation to the level of depth and abstraction of the knowledge to be acquired. To ensure inclusive education, the development of Instructional Design must be carried out carefully to address all these differences. Inclusive education through universal perspectives provides learning for all students, respecting their limitations, whether cognitive or physical. Among the challenges in planning an inclusive course, it is possible to point out the identification of educational needs, the creation of a flexible, personalized curriculum, seeking the most appropriate communication for the student, establishing actions that optimize time for course creation and delivery. In this context, this work aims to discuss the challenges in implementing Universal Instructional Design techniques supported by digital technologies to foster inclusive education.
