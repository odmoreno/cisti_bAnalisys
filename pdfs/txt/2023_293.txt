Automatic Application to Monitor Skin Lesions Using Thermography Images
ABSTRACT
Currently, for obtaining thermographic images there is a wide variety of portable thermographic cameras for mobile phones. Thus, by connecting a thermographic camera of this type to a smartphone, it is possible to obtain thermographic images of reasonable quality in a simple, quick, and painless way. Its transport and handling are quite easy, which allows its use by anyone and anywhere. Furthermore, the cost of these cameras is reduced, thus making their use even more accessible. In the present work, it was intended to develop an application to automatically segment and evaluate the skin lesions from thermographic images obtained through the smartphone. The detection of the injured region (by the percentage of area) and obtaining its characteristics, such as minimum, average, and maximum temperature were implemented to monitor the lesion. The results obtained are promising and reinforce the interest in using this application in health centers or by medical and nursing teams, for the care, prevention, and monitoring of skin lesions in conjunction with other diagnostic methods.
