Design and development of Learning objects based on conceptual model: Competency-based approach
ABSTRACT
The design and development of learning objects for higher education, currently surpassed by competences based approach, require a well known structure and pedagogical rules. Educators need both a methodology and tools to guide them through these processes, to provide valid and reliable learning objects as outcomes. With the objective of addressing these needs, this paper presents an ontology based conceptual model. It defines a Learning objects structure, restrictions and relationships among components, and pedagogical rules. Then a recommender system that guides educators in the learning objects creation process, can be developed based on this conceptual model proposed.
