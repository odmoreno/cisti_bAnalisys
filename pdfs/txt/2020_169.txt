Graphical Semantic Authentication
ABSTRACT
Authenticate on the system using only the authentication method based on username and password is not enough to ensure an acceptable level of information security for a critical system. It has been used in a multi factor authentication to increase the information security during the authentication process. However factors like what you have cause an inconvenience to the users, because the users during the authentication process always will need to have a device in their possession that complements the authentication process. By the other side of the biometric factor might change during the time, it needs an auxiliary device that will increase the costs and it also might be dependent from environmental conditions to work appropriately. To avoid some problems that exist in multi factor authentication, this work purposes authentication through semantic representation in OWL (web Ontology Language) tuples of recognized concepts in images as a form to increase the security in the authentication process. A proof of the concept was modeled and implemented, it has a demonstration that the robustness of this authentication system depends on the complexity of relationship in the semantic base (ontology) and in the simplicity of the relationship identified in the images.
