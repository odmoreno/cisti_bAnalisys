MOOC on bullying for primary school teachers
ABSTRACT
The exponential growth of bullying in schools has contributed significantly to the urgent need for training on this topic, both for teachers and parents, as well as for students. At the same time, the technological changes that we have witnessed in the last decade allow us to diversify and adapt training to current realities, including online environments where cyberbullying can take on dimensions that many children are not prepared for. Thus, the creation of a MOOC seems the most appropriate and dynamic way to teach and prevent bullying in times of a pandemic. Supported by a panel of experts, this study aims to answer clearly and objectively the following research questions: i) What types of MOOC exist in the scope of bullying in Primary Education and the respective platforms for its distribution? How can this type of training contribute to teacher training? What characteristics can we include to improve or innovate the structure of a new MOOC?
