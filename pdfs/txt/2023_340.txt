Data Mart and key performance indicators to optimize decisions in a medical service clinic
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research is to implement an application that allows the Clinic of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) to optimally manage the information and services offered to teachers, employees and students. This improvement involves the combination of technologies with tools and processes that will allow transforming the stored data from information to knowledge aligned with the strategies of the Admissions and General Management areas and is part of the business intelligence proposed by the UNMSM Clinic. The methodology used in the implementation was Hephaestus, which was selected after a "Benchmarking", the requirements were obtained in a survey that allowed to identify the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to provide relevant information and improve the decision making of the UNMSM Clinic. As a result, the implemented application allows to generate reports that can be graphs and pivot tables related to each specified requirement, which are generated from the deployment of the OLAP cube whose base is composed of a multidimensional model of a Data Mart. Achieving efficiency in decision making.
