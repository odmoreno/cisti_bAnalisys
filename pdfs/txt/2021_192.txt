Analyzing narrative and radio language of the Serial Podcast
ABSTRACT
This investigation analyzes a sample of six episodes from the first season of the podcast Serial, with the goal of studying the characteristics of the recent narrative podcasting genre. Through content, thematic and radio language analysis of each episode, we determined that Serial consciously uses silence, music, voice and sound effects as resources to capture the listener, in a way that is closer to cinematography than radio. Moreover, we found that the thematic and content of Serial place this podcast as poli generic, with a clear protagonism of the narrator, which not only guides the story but also is part of it.
