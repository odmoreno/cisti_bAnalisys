The results analysis of using MIGME-RRC methodology for software process improvement
ABSTRACT
Software process improvement is an obvious and logical way to address the increasing need to be competitive in the software industry. Consequently, software industry is more and more concerned about software process improvement (SPI). However, even when many organizations are motivated to improve their software processes, very few know how best to do so. Therefore, introducing software process improvement has been a path full of obstacles, leaving those who are involved in the improvement frustrated and more convinced than ever that they must continue doing their work as before. This paper shows the results analysis of implementing a software process improvement in the project management processes of fourth offices at a multinational organization. The process improvement was done by using a methodology which implements a smooth and continuous process improvement through the use of a multi-model environment as a reference model.
