Determinants of e-voting acceptance in Chile: An approach based on the UTAUT model
ABSTRACT
This study analyzes the acceptance of e-voting in a segment of the population little investigated. The UTAUT model is used as a theoretical basis, to which trust in technology is added as a precedent of the intention to use e-voting. Perceptions of privacy and security are established as determinants of trust towards technology. The study was carried out with students of a Chilean university through an online survey. All the proposed constructs significantly influence the intention to use e-voting, with social influence being the factor that influences the most, followed by trust in technology. Gender acts as a moderating variable in the relationship between social influence and the intention to use e-voting, being stronger for men than for women. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are stated, and future research works are proposed.
