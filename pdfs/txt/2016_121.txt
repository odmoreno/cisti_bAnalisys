Methodological proposal and support tools to model and validate conceptual schemes
ABSTRACT
This paper proposes the definition of a methodology and associated support tool for the specification and validation of a Conceptual Model, through automated processing to Finite Automata models and corresponding validation. It describes the characteristics of modeling process, using the “Notation for Business Process Modeling” in the modeling activity, applying the concepts of Model-Driven Software Development. It's proposed a direct mapping between activities of the business process and Use Cases, which are transformed to state machines that are subjected to an automated validation process, and thus validate the set of functional specifications in the conceptual model of a domain under study.
