Improving the spatial resolution of the images Ikonos beginning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV): An application of image fusion with wavelet transform
ABSTRACT
This article aims to develop and evaluate two methodologies for improving the spatial resolution without significant loss of the spectral resolution of a multi-spectral Ikonos image using an image acquired with an UAV. In the first method from multi-spectral image and image acquired with the UAV get the intensity of the multispectral image (Im) and the intensity of UAV (Iv), using the RGB-IHS transformation respectively. Then applying fusion to the intensity components of Im and Iv using Wavelet transform together with ARSIS' technique to genere a new intensity (n_Imv). This n_Imv together with hue and saturation obtained from Ikonos image are transformed inversely to generate a new multispectral image (N-MULT-I). In the second process a new panchromatic is created through of average of three RGB bands of UAV's image (fpan), then fusion is applied using wavelet transform to Im and fpan to generate a new intensity (n_Ifpm). Using n_Ifpm and hue and saturation components of IKonos image a new image multispectral is generated (N-MULT-fpan). Finally, results are shown and there are evaluated with Correlation Coefficient, ERGAS, RASE and Qu. Finding that better results are obtained with the second process.
