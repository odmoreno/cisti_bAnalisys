Improvement of Information Flows Using Lean Information Management and Data Visualization tools : A case applied to an Improvement Suggestions System in a Manufacturing Company
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a case study of the application of Lean Information Management and Data Visualization to improve the information flows of an improvement suggestions system in a manufacturing company. The process was mapped and the wastes to which it and the resulting data were subject were identified. Since the process lacked key performance indicators capable of demonstrating its status, to support decision-making, a solution was implemented using the Lean Information Management and the Microsoft Power BI tool to provide the main participants of the process with a set of key performance indicators, through data visualization in a structured, simple, appealing, and intuitive way. The validation with end-users allows to affirm that the information created and transmitted through the new solution contributes to improving the quality and speed of decision-making, as aiming to increase the efficiency of the process, and the competitiveness between teams.
