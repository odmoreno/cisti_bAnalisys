Gamification strategies for mobile device applications: A systematic review
ABSTRACT
In the quest to engage and motivate users on the use of mobile applications, the gamification concept has been excelling in the market since incorporates game elements in a non-game context. Scoring systems, challenges, competitions and badges, are some of the elements implemented in many fields, such as health, education, ecological awareness, among others. In this context, this study aimed to systematically review available literature to identify gamification strategies used in mobile applications. A search was conducted in ACM, Science Direct and Scopus databases, from March to June 2016. A total of 402 studies were found, 23 of which met the eligibility criteria. The results demonstrated the heterogeneity of gamification elements being used and the impact they caused in the applications, especially as a motivational factor for users. This study provides the basis for future research on gamification methods and emphasizes the importance of this concept to increase engagement and provide enjoyment to users.
