mHealth initiatives in Portugal
ABSTRACT
The paradigm of health care delivery is slowly aligning with the needs and habits of modern patients. Mobile computing may be a solution to respond to the growing trend and need for health care sharing and collaboration, enabling the redesign of processes giving rise to new models of health care delivery. Seeking to determine the situation in Portugal regarding mobile computing initiatives in this domain (mobile health) and their status of implementation, and following the methodology of Levac et al., we conducted a survey and an exploratory study whose results were mirrored in a matrix developed for this purpose. The mapping of the study aims to summarize the acquired knowledge in an accessible and summarized format so that decision-makers, practitioners and consumers can make effective use of the findings.
