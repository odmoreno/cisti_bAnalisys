WebLab a laboratory controlled remote access by the Internet: A case study of a UAV — Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with mobile device
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a Laboratory of Remote Access education, being the object of study UAV — Unmanned Aerial Vehicle internet that can be used for courses in Aeronautical Engineering. Through a ground station mobile, you can remotely piloting UAVs, capture video images through cameras shipped, and determine their geographical position of the region monitored in real time. Basically, the ground station is composed of a dedicated computer, links and video data, to collect information from the UAV, specific computer software, among other devices to support the application.
