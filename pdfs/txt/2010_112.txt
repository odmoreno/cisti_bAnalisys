Analysis of non technical skills for ICT profiles
ABSTRACT
Traditional conception of ICT education and employment analysis has devoted a great effort to determine specific technical knowledge and skills needed for a successful professional career. However, competency-based approach for Human Resources (HR) management in organizations has finally changed this approach pushing more interest in non technical skills, the so-called soft skills. This paper presents an analysis of non technical skills required for a variety of IT (Information Technology) positions and areas based on data extracted from more than 3000 ICT job offers published in Spain during the last years. Requirements are also compared with those expressed as requirements for telco engineers and industrial engineers. We can conclude that soft skills profiles are different for each case and that these data should guide actions in education and career development areas.
