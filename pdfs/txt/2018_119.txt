A prototype to manage cybersecurity in small companies
ABSTRACT
Cybersecurity is defined as the protection of information assets through the treatment of threats that put information at risk. Enterprises, regardless of their size, must manage the cybersecurity risks to improve the security and resilience of their assets. The large enterprises are increasingly investing in cybersecurity. However, the perception of this danger in smaller companies is limited, and few of them have among their list of priorities to protect their information systems. In the market, there are few cybersecurity systems for small businesses focused on asset management, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. For this reason, this paper seeks to identify cybersecurity management tools for small enterprises and it describes some of the requirements that a cybersecurity management tool should have to cover the needs of small enterprises. These requirements will be reflected in a prototype.
