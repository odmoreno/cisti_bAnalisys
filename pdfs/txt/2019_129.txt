Development of Reading Competence in Nursing Students at the Regional Autonomous University of the Andes UNIANDES, through Tics
ABSTRACT
Reading is a complex process carried out by each person by itself, allowing the analysis and understanding of information and global knowledge characteristic of today's society, which, based on technological advances, is ubiquitously available to everyone. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) provide tools that contribute to improve reading comprehension with flexibility and adaptation to different educational and work environments. The Higher Education Institutions (IES) show a deterioration of the reading competence of their students and as an answer they are implementing changes within the curricula of the career programs, in order to implement strategies that improve these competence. This research describes the use of innovative strategies using ICTs that improved reading skills at the inferential, literal and critical levels of students of the nursing career of the Regional Autonomous University of the Andes (UNIANDES), using a Learning Management System (Moodle), activities, resources and extensions of it, in addition face-to-face and virtual sessions that wake up a motivation for reading and improved the critical thinking of the participants.
