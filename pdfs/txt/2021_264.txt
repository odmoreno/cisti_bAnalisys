Knowledge management applying disruptive technologies as a response to the COVID-19 crisis in public administration
ABSTRACT
The accelerated propagation of Sars-Cov2 and the consequent Covid-19 disease in the world has led the public administrations of different countries to use the advantages provided by disruptive technologies to effectively and efficiently manage the large volume of data generated. This communication presents the main characteristics and advances that distinguish the development of the initiative called Epidempredict for Covid19 in Panama. The project involves the implementation of a cloud platform that facilitates data analysis in a distributed, collaborative and secure form. This platform will enable efficient data ingestion, administration, analysis, visualization and export. The development will be a solution oriented to VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) environments. The implementation integrates tools and resources supported by technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) integrating models, predictive algorithms and dashboards that enable decision making based on real and meaningful data. The project proposes the use of a neuro-hybrid model, based on a SIR model with artificial intelligence, combining several algorithms. This initiative aims to support the health authorities of the Panamanian public administration by facilitating decision making and the adoption and implementation of precise strategic actions in the field of health and public welfare.
