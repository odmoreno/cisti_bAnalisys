Evaluating external researchers impact on a research community social capital with social network analysis
ABSTRACT
Nowadays research institutions develop a significant amount of their activities financed by research grants and scholarships that sustain a constant human capital flow of temporary research labor. In this work and through the usage of Social Network Analysis we will study the impact of such policies in a research institution. This evaluation will be made through the use of social network analysis techniques applied to authorship data from papers published in international journals with refereeing covering the last twenty years of research activities from a Portuguese leading research institution in the field of telecommunications - Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT).
