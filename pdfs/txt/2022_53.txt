Analysis of jamming and spoofing cyber-attacks on drones
ABSTRACT
The use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or better known as “drones” has increased in the last years and this is due to its versatility of use, be it for military purpose, civil construction, mining, topography, agriculture, environment, among others. These air vehicles have a range of embedded technologies, which make them attractive and easy to use. However, there are cyber vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious purposes (terrorism, invasion of privacy, drug trafficking and property damage). This work presents a brief analysis of jamming and spoofing cyber-attacks on UAV system and points out some directions for studies on drone cybersecurity.
