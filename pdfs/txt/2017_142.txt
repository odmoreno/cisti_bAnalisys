Android app lifestyle â€” Smartphone and smartwatch integred into a cloud computing by web services
ABSTRACT
Hypertension is a chronic disease characterized by high blood pressure levels. Lack of adherence to the treatment of hypertension is a growing concern among health professionals. For this, m-Health solutions are increasingly evident, since they can automate processes and facilitate the inclusion of the patient's health conditions in a practical way and in any place, allowing the health professional to follow up. This work aims to report the development of an m-Health solution to automate the follow-up process for hypertensive patients. The solution will be comprised of an Android application for Smartphone Lifestyle App, integrated into a Smartwatch and Server Lifestyle, all components of the e-Lifestyle System. For the development of the Lifestyle App were used Android Studio, a Motorola Moto 360 watch and a LG K10 Smartphone. The results showed that the frameworks and the APIs used allowed to abstract several concepts of connection and communication between different devices, which facilitated the development.
