Prospective vision on virtual education in AntioquiaColombia: horizon 2050
ABSTRACT
Governments are devoting significant resources to propose strategies that disseminate and exploit into prospective studies. In 2019, the Government of Antioquia (Department located in Colombia) launched a program called “Antioquia 2050”, which it is based on a long-term planning process. It is a rigorous exercise to offer projections to new politicians and their future generations. One of the axes analyzed was education. This article presents a prospective study on virtual education in the Antioquia region (Colombia). The methodology of the study consisted of a participatory and integrative series of techniques mostly used in prospective exercises (panel of experts, Delphi method, scenarios). Some interesting data collected suggested the benefits of virtual platforms, by allowing the educational system to scale up at a lower cost and with greater reach. Evidence found in this research showed that higher education in 20 years would represent a basic and/or minimal condition in Antioquia. The connectivity of the human being with technology will facilitate the incorporation of virtual learning mechanisms from everyday life in a ubiquitous way; at any time and place in their daily lives. The results of this study were shared in the “Summit of wise men (Cumbre de visionarios)”, an event that took place at the end of 2019. Additionally, the study is also part of the research project “Adaptive learning management tool based on problems to enhance collaborative work in virtual courses at university level”, co-financed by Colciencias (Proposal Call 8042018).
