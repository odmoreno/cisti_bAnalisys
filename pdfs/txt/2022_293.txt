Life in Second Life through the eyes of the residents
ABSTRACT
More than a virtual world, Second Life (SL) is characterized by being an online metaverse in which the user can, in fact, create a second life. Since Second Life is a metaverse that simulates reality, users or residents can explore the world, meet other people, participate in activities, and thus simulate real world routines [1]. Based on the LOCUS project, this article intends, through the vision of the residents, to understand their preferences and what they value most in Second Life. The focus is on the space and the places they most like and what they value; on communication, that is, how are the communicational interactions between residents and preferences; and, on playability (if there is playability and if there is interest in this topic). In this way, the respondents' answers will be a trigger to build the interaction and playability of the village of Amiais in Second Life. Through this feedback, Amiais will continue to be developed with the goal of being an interesting environment that arouses curiosity, the desire to play and interact with other residents.
