3D modeling mechanisms for educational resources in medical and health area
ABSTRACT
The 3D physical models have been used crosswise as a way of teaching in the most diverse areas of knowledge and have played an important role in the learning act, allowing physical contact, volume perception and knowing the exact position of each model's component by simulation of practical issues. In medical and health area, 3D digital models can significantly complement the traditional physical models as well as providing other important features, some of them unique, that must be properly valued. The biggest issues, in 3D digital modeling, are the modeling complexity and the handling of large amount of information on 3D representation via internet broadcast where bandwidth can be critical. This article presents a study on different 3D modeling mechanisms focused on the production of medical and health education resources always concerning with the correct anatomical form.
