The business model of the company film in Ecuador
ABSTRACT
Starting in 2006, film production in Ecuador begins a slow but significant growth. The main producers of film projects in the country are registered in the database of the Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Creation ICCA. Under this premise, the objective of the research is to know the business strategies that these companies develop and determine with a mixed methodology the model they have adopted to obtain financing for their films, either their own, public aid or sponsorship through private companies. . We can reveal that this growing Cultural Industry has to work on the professionalization of production that is managed without an administrative and managerial vision.
