A Recommender System for Identifying Psychosocial Risk Factors among University Academics : The Case of The Official Mexican Norm NOM-035-STPS-2018
ABSTRACT
University academics reported having high levels of stress due to their functions and responsibilities. Universities demand academics a more in-depth preparation and commitment to their academic trajectory. The Official Mexican Norm NOM-035-STPS-2018 aims to establish the elements to identify, analyze and prevent psychosocial risk factors, and promote a favorable organizational environment in the workplace. This paper presents a recommender system to support the application of the Norm NOM-035 for identifying the level of psychosocial risk factors in university academics. The recommender system provides recommendations based on the risk factors' levels and academics' characteristics. The recommender system's ultimate goal is to provide relevant information to the university executive staff to support a better-informed decision-making process regarding the policies and programs to manage high levels of psychosocial risk factors.
