The Impact of Technological Evolution on Audit Procedures : A perception of the Statutory Auditors
ABSTRACT
The impact that technological evolution has on the current digital transformation of most business processes is undeniable. Auditing is also one of these areas. This study, using a questionnaire survey addressed to Portuguese Statutory Auditors, aims to assess the impact of technological developments, namely, the auditors' perception of the use of these tools, the advantages, and disadvantages of their use. The study is also intended to assess the level of knowledge about new audit trends and their respective audit potential. The results obtained demonstrate that technological evolution has, in the auditors' opinion, a positive impact on the audit, regardless of the tools used. It is also concluded that, given this evolution, tests of controls and substantive procedures must necessarily be adjusted. Considering the context of permanent change, this study also showed that auditors are aware and prepared for possible changes in their work as new technological trends require.
