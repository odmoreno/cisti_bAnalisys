The influence of human factors on the software testing process: The impact of these factors on the software testing process
ABSTRACT
Software testing is a key process that ensures a reliable quality product, and like other activities in the development process, have a wide range of tools available, but still requires a lot of human work, where the final quality of the software can be impacted directly by several factors. In this sense, this study aims to identify the human factors (cognitive, operational and organizational) present in the test process and to define the influence of these factors during their execution. Thus, the article presents a study with quantitative methods and techniques of the survey type, in which 112 professionals from the test area participated in 17 Brazilian states. The results provide a set of human factors that correlate with the final quality of a software product or service.
