Learning the ODS by means of an IEQ monitoring IoT system in campus
ABSTRACT
The efficient management of the energy resources is a subject that, currently, is acquiring increasing relevance. In fact, it has a big impact in some of the major Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Also, the new concepts introduced with the Industry 4.0 paradigm are being implemented successfully in other domains than manufacturing applications. One example may be found in architecture and construction. This article presents an IoT system aimed at monitoring the Indoors Environment Quality (IEQ) conditions in buildings. Typical technologies used at the Industry 4.0 have been used: Smart Sensors, wireless communications and monitoring and analysis tools. This IoT system was specifically designed to be implemented by engineering students following the Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology as part of the curriculum of an Industrial Informatics course (6 ECTS). Despite being a small scale system, it may be used to (1) monitor the IEQ parameters of one building; (2) learn to manage the tools frequently used in current Industry 4.0 applications; (3) make students aware about the need of doing an adequate use of the resources; and (4) illustrate how to apply the concepts learnt in the classroom to solve real problems.
