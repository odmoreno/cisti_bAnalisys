Using Browsing Bots for Creating Academic e-Portfolios from a LMS
ABSTRACT
An academic e-Portafolio is a relevant component which is used in several learning approaches. However, their implementation carries laborious activities related to collect the learning artifacts, and involves a significant investment of time and resources. This work addresses the creation of an academic e-Portafolio, focused in the collection of information from an LMS (Learning Management System), through the use of browsing bots, and identifying keywords which are useful for indexing the current information. The proposal is evaluated on Google Classroom using a data set of subjects completely delivered in virtual way during the pandemic of COVID-19. The results present measures related to the number of clicks, keywords, and content of the subjects.
