Incorporation web in secondary education in Galicia
ABSTRACT
The incorporation of new technologies in everyday life, specifically Internet and the Web, has been rising steadily and similarly happened in the world of education, however, this trend has continued at different rates. The Xunta de Galicia has made available to schools a project called Webs Din√°micas, which aims to democratize the use of these technologies in education. We think this is the time that teachers should be incorporated into the new teaching model that is presented for what we think is necessary to analyze the situation and establish a training schedule to facilitate this process.
