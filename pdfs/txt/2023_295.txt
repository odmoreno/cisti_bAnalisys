Building a Sustainable Community Strategy to Improve Wellness
ABSTRACT
Health care organizations have been transforming their operations to reach patient populations by developing community strategies for preventive and care transition post-hospital discharge by leveraging community partners and technology. Sustaining such strategies, however, needs feedback from both collaborative partners and the patient population. In this paper we discuss the use of a value lens to design patient services and assess methods to gather feedback for the adaptation of strategies to address changing patient and participating organizational expectations using the example of a wellness program.
