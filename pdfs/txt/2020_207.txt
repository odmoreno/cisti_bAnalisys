CAN Based Network for Modular Battery Bank with Security Features
ABSTRACT
Energy storage in electric vehicles and homes can be obtained by the use of batteries, being Lithium based cells common nowadays. These batteries need a close control for evaluating namely its state-of-charge, to use as efficiently as possible the stored energy, ensuring an operational safe use of the battery bank. This article presents a modular battery bank, composed of modules of four lithium cells each, focusing on the communication network that is based on CAN, which controls its charge and discharge and produces alarms for diverse conditions. As this network is connected to the global vehicle or home network, some security measures are discussed, as internal or external attacks can happen that can hinder or even interrupt the energy supply, which can constitute a severe major hazard.
