Technological solution for the identification and reduction of stress level using wearables
ABSTRACT
In this article, a technological solution is proposed to identify and reduce the level of mental stress of a person through a wearable device. The proposal identifies a physiological variable: heart rate, through the integration between a wearable and a mobile application through text recognition using the back camera of a smartphone. As part of the process, the technological solution shows a list of guidelines depending on the level of stress obtained in a given time. Once completed, it can be measured again in order to confirm the evolution of your stress level. This proposal allows the patient to keep his stress level under control in an effective and accessible way in real time. The proposal consists of four phases: 1. Collection of parameters through the wearable; 2. Data reception by the mobile application; 3. Data storage in a cloud environment and 4. Data collection and processing; this last phase is divided into 4 sub-phases: 4.1. Stress level analysis, 4.2. Recommendations to decrease the level obtained, 4.3. Comparison between measurements and 4.4. Measurement history per day. The proposal was validated in a workplace with people from 20 to 35 years old located in Lima, Peru. Preliminary results showed that 80% of patients managed to reduce their stress level with the proposed solution.
