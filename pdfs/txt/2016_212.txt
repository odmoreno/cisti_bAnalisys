A bat algorithm to solve the manufacturing cell design problem
ABSTRACT
Manufacturing Cell Design is a problem that is aimed at distributing the different machines of a center of production in cells, so that the parts of the final product to be manufactured with the least amount of travel in its manufacturing process. Bat Algorithm is an algorithm inspired by the behavior of echolocation in bats. Using a balance sheet of the frequency and automatic tuning of exploration and exploitation by controlling the rate of volume and emission pulses. The following work shows the resolution of the Manufacturing Cell Design, by means of Bat Algorithm, an algorithm that proved to be effective for this problem because it has reached the optimum in all problems with which the tests were conducted.
