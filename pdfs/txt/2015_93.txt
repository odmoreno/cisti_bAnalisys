Technical and pedagogical usability in a virtual learning environment: A case study at the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte â€” Brazil
ABSTRACT
Bearing in mind the new generation of virtual users' increasing demands, it is expected that virtual learning environments hold now a better quality design, from linearity to internationally recommended standards, including presentation aspects, interface and interaction modes, which are principles of technical usability, as a quality attribute that comprises methods to improve ease of use. A research is being conducted, aiming to investigate the perceptions of students attending a technical course in the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology in Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN), Brazil, regarding technical and pedagogical usability in the learning process. Even though the research is still taking place, the current paper presents the study and the preliminary results so far accomplished that point to the importance of pedagogical usability principles to achieve educational targets.
