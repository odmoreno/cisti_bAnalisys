Spatial-temporal data watch to digital media: PhD thesis proposal in informatics engineering
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a PhD thesis proposal in Informatics Engineering, scheduled for completion in July 2018. This PhD thesis is part of Spatio-Temporal Information Systems, with applicability in technological communication tools and visual representation of knowledge, for Digital Media (newspapers, radio and television). It is intended to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the value of heterogeneous, multivariate, multidimensional information characteristic of this context, produced and shared by different sources, in different formats. It is hoped that participation in this Doctoral Symposium will enrich and update the work in progress and help the preparation of the PhD thesis proposal.
