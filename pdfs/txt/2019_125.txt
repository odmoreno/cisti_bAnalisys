Performance of Hash Functions in Blockchain Applied to IoT Devices
ABSTRACT
The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network composed of several devices (things) connected to the Internet and to each other. IoT services are increasingly growing and are allowing companies to deploy scalable solutions with reduced costs and instantaneous data access. These solutions require seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such requirements can be given to a company's IoT solution by applying blockchain technology. This paper analyzes the blockchain technology and the advantages and challenges behind its implementation in an IoT environment. A blockchain in IoT scenario was developed to evaluate the performance of different cryptographic hash functions in the IoT device RaspberryPi. Conclusions were drawn when it comes to the viability of some hash functions mainly based on the low resource characteristic shared by the IoT devices, which compromises the performance of the hash function.
