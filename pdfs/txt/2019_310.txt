Identification of representative terms of datasets
ABSTRACT
The development of open data portals is increasingly widespread internationally, and they are high demanded by software applications' developers. However, when trying to use similar data from different portals, they found the problem of lack of homogenization. This article collects techniques to analyze the terms that appear in the description of the datasets and represent their content semantically. With these techniques, a model is proposed to identify the most suitable terms, with the aim that they can be used in datasets' selection or unification processes.
