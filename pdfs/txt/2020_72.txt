Canvas LMS and Collaborative work as a learning methodology in virtual environments
ABSTRACT
With the purpose of strengthening the competences for teamwork in the virtual modality, the School of Basic Sciences of the Institución Universitaria Politécnico Grancolombiano, since 2011, has implemented strategies that allow this objective to be fulfilled through collaborative work; which is conceived as a space in which the student has the possibility to interact with his peers, in an academic setting that allows not only individual contribution, but the discussion and consolidation of mathematical activity; leading to the strengthening of social, communicative and disciplinary competences, through the integration of previous knowledge, experiences and learning styles. Initially, the wiki tool was used as a workspace and registration of the process log; Then a forum associated with two evaluation rubrics was implemented, one of these focused on the process (competences of being and doing) and the other on the competences of knowledge. The objective of the research is to identify the variables strategy that affect the level of student participation, in order to achieve better performance at the individual and group level. For this, the implemented in the calculation module I of the School of Basic Sciences was analyzed and the results that have been generated in the process, by applying the action research methodology.
