Comparative Performance Analysis between MQTT and CoAP Protocols for IoT with Raspberry PI 3 in IEEE 802.11 Environments
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the study of two of Internet of Things protocols, CoAP and MQTT, in a wireless environment, being used oriented to the domestic field, based on a simple exercise that involves turning on and of f a lamp. After the implementation of each protocol, tests and measurements were made with tools such as Wireshark and Jperf for proper comparisons. Finally, the analysis of the results is presented, which indicates that the use of MQTT is efficient for the use of cloud services and real-time control of objects within the home.
