IntelliSenses: Sensing the Internet of Things
ABSTRACT
The popularity of the Internet of Things allows the existence of many connected devices and thus, the quantity of data available is higher. However, many data are unusable if they are alone or out of context but a combination of these data can be valuable. This idea is also present in the information gathered by the human senses. The human body uses the senses to gather data about the environment in order to take the best possible decisions taking into consideration the whole environment. Our proposal is based on the same idea. We propose the creation of several subsystems that would simulate the human senses and another subsystem capable to manage them, and take decisions based on the data gathered by all subsystems. In this way, the data gathered by one subsystem would be complemented with the data gathered by the rest of systems as the human body does.
