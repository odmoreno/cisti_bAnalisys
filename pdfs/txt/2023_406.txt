Collaborative wiki with accessible and non-accessible examples of WCAG guidelines
ABSTRACT
A collaborative Wiki has been developed with information related to the WCAG 2.1 Guidelines in order to facilitate accessibility evaluation following the WCAG-EM methodology. The main objective has been to include information on how to evaluate the accessibility criteria of a Website. Each accessibility criterion has been divided into different sub-assessments to facilitate the validation of specific aspects to be tested. A total of 92 sub-assessments have been added that belong to the 78 criteria of the WCAG 2.1 Guidelines. Each sub-assessment contains the following sections: a) the title of the sub-assessment, b) a concrete accessible and non-accessible example of what the tester can observe on the website; c) the support tools to perform the assessment and d) the references to the WCAG 2.1 guidelines corresponding to that criterion. The content included in the Wiki platform has been evaluated on the validity of accessible and non-accessible examples and it has been observed that correct examples have been added when the criteria have support tools that allow to automatically evaluate, for example, the source code or color contrast. However, the examples were not entirely adequate when the criteria are evaluated manually with very generic, ambiguous evaluation instructions or complex terms and without adequate support tools.
