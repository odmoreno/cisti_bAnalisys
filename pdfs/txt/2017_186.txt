An exploratory analysis about requirements of serious games for learning support
ABSTRACT
Games development can be considered a constantly evolving area that requires a considerable effort by the developers to create elements that capture the players' attention. Researches indicate that games can produce a high engagement, which indicate their potential as tools for education, training or awareness. Games designed with a primary purpose other than entertaining, such as the applications mentioned, are known as serious games. For the design of a serious game it is necessary, among other matters, to define the requirements that will be in the game, adapting the motivational resources of the games and the learning goals in a coherent way. In this paper are presented the results of an exploratory analysis on the subject through an opinion survey whose objective was to investigate the interest of potential players in different aspects of games and the use of serious games. The results indicate functional and nonfunctional requirements that can provide more effectiveness in the application of games as a tool to support learning. The results also exhibited how the serious games are being used and the degree of players' satisfaction with this situation.
