A proposal for the supplementation of traditional Postmarket Surveillance systems based on Named Entity Recognition
ABSTRACT
Nowadays vaccines against COVID-19 have begun to be applied and some adverse events may arise. Postmarket surveillance studies are important to obtain information about rare adverse events (AE). Traditional methods of postmarket surveillance are dependent on spontaneous notifications and are therefore subject to underreporting. Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been used for the information extraction. We did a survey on recent papers that have used NER to supplement postmarket surveillance systems based on the information extraction of social media, with predominance of websites related to some health topics, electronic health records (EHR), official databases and reference databases. We present negative and positive endorses for each approach of the use of NER and propose a guide for the use of NER in the information extraction task to supplement traditional postmarket surveillance systems.
