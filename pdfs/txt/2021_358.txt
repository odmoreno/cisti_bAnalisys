Vehicle Smart Grid Allocation using Multi-Agent Systems sensitive to Irrational Behavior and Unstable Power Supply
ABSTRACT
As the number of electric vehicles increases, the access to public charging points along an electric grid can become congested. This study proposes a multi-agent solution to solve the task of electric vehicle allocation on smart grid chargers sensitive to the vehicle's base, destination and battery profile for charging convenience. In particular, we assess robustness against irrational vehicle behavior and unstable power supply. The proposal follows a design science research methodology. We consider an unstable power source and agents with emotional behaviours, such as irrational preconception of stations and individual perceptions experience. Different environments are simulated with an automatic topology engine extraction grounded on real world urban scenarios. This tool may be helpful to aid planning by simulating station distribution in a parameterizable way. The simulation results allow for a preview of the architecture performance at a system wide level considering several scenarios with distinct characteristics. The smart grid consistently manages energy delivery, leaving no cars uncharged.
