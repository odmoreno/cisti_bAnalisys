User modelling in scheduling system with artificial neural networks
ABSTRACT
User modelling has become a central subject for anybody interested in understanding how users interact with technology. Personalization is a key issue in an era when there is so much information and so many people interacting in so many ways. Modern users desire a customized experience that adapts itself to their requirements and understands what they need even before they notice it. In order to morph any system into an adapting one, every relevant interaction with its users has to be maintained. Then, a mathematical structure capable of discovering patterns amongst that information is necessary, being able to classify users according to the roles they play. With a correct user categorization, the system knows when, how and what to do to adapt its content, via a mixed-initiative approach. In this paper, an artificial neural network is selected as classifier and users are divided in three roles, from beginners to experts. ADSyS, the target system of this proposal, adapts its content based on who is operating it, providing a higher usability. This guide on how to adapt a system to its users is built as part of ADSyS, but is intended to be generalized as a foundation to other systems.
