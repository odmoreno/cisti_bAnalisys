Multi-level visualization in decision support systems: Literature review
ABSTRACT
The information visualization (InfoVis) is defined as “the use of visual, interactive and visual representations supported by computer, to increase cognition”. InfoVis tools and methods help us to accelerate our understanding and action in a world of ever-increasing data volumes. Data visualization improves understanding, particularly with multidimensional data sets. Visual analysis methods allow decision makers to match their human flexibility, creativity and background knowledge with the enormous storage and processing capabilities of today's computers for information on complex problems. Using advanced visual interfaces, humans can interact directly with data analysis. In this article, we will review the literature about the subject “Multi-Level Visualization on Decision Support Systems Models”, with a main focus on the architectures used and the approaches to the visualization of the extracted information resulting from the existing data, with main incidence in the last few years.
