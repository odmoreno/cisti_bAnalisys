Software Aging and Rejuvenation in Microservices: A Systematic Literature Mapping
ABSTRACT
Software Aging and Rejuvenation (SAR) has gained importance in recent years as software systems have become more complex and critical to the operation of many organizations. SAR techniques have sought for software systems to remain reliable and work well for long periods, especially in systems that require high availability. This work aims to identify how studies on SAR in microservices are being explored and how they are being validated and monitored. For this, a Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) was developed, resulting in seven relevant articles capable of answering six research questions. The SLM identified the most productive authors in this area of research, which universities were most cited, which continents were carried out on the aging and rejuvenation of software in microservices, which platforms and orchestrators are most used in microservices, which methods and techniques are used to force microservices to age and rejuvenate, and what capabilities were monitored and exploited.
