Integration of Business Intelligence with e-commerce
ABSTRACT
The growth of online shopping has allowed e-commerce to become a usual concept. However, companies still have little knowledge about their customers and the most appropriate and effective processes to create a perfect fit between costumers' needs and companies' interests. To solve this problem, it is important to join e-commerce with Business Intelligence (BI). This paper provides a survey of the most popular business intelligence and e-commerce open source platforms and proposes an architecture to combine e-commerce with business intelligence. We study Pentaho and SpagoBI business intelligence platforms and Magento and OpenCart e-commerce platforms. An integration model of e-commerce and BI platforms is also proposed using an API and communication mechanisms.
