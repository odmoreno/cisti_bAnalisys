An alternative communication tool in cases of aphasia
ABSTRACT
The development of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools as a temporary or permanent resource in cases of communication disorders, is an ongoing challenge for the scientific community. Up to date, several studies were carried out on rehabilitation activities using AAC tools with aphasic public. However, there is still a gap of solutions in this field. This work investigates the use of AAC resources in cases of aphasia and the available solutions in Brazil. The goal is to develop a responsive-web solution for professionals who deals with the rehabilitation of the aphasic individual. A pilot study, conducted with the participation of 10 aphasic individuals and 5 speech therapy professionals, shows important preliminary results.
