Analysis of the issues underlying the certification of invoicing software
ABSTRACT
Portuguese companies that have invoicing software, certified or in the process of certification by the Tax and Customs Authority, need to comply with technical requirements that involve business continuity and disaster recovery. There are some constraints in the implementation of these requirements, due to technical issues, interpretation of tax legislation or the selection of regulations or good practices in the area of Information and Communication Technologies. The objective of the paper is to present a set of concerns underlying the design of a business continuity plan, supported by current tax legislation, by standards and codes of good practice. In view of the constraints of Portuguese business capacity, it is also presented a minimum solution that meets the legal, regulatory, good practices and conceptual requirements of Information and Communication Technologies for the design of a Business Continuity Plan. The method used in this investigation was based on the analysis of international standards ITIL, ISO, CMMI, COBIT and the Portuguese legal framework in the field of invoicing. The main expected results are to foster the design of Business Continuity Plan in Portuguese companies, in order to reduce the gap between the practices currently in place and the requirements underlying certification, as a way to prepare companies to deal with disruptive events in invoicing business processes.
