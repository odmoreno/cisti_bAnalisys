Business intelligence admission to hospital emergency
ABSTRACT
An hospital emergency department is complex to manage due to the variety of diseases and injuries that should be able to answer to and also by the difficulty in predicting the number of patients that will receive. The implementation of Manchester triage system at hospital emergency departments helped the prioritization of patient attendance based on clinical needs leading to optimization of hospital resources allocation and with this scenario it becames necessary to measure the activity that is being done. Through Manchester triage data collected in three hospital centers, Vila Nova de Gaia â€” Espinho, Oporto and north Lisbon, it was developed a business intelligence prototype system that enables users to have access to a reporting platform with dashboards where they can easily analyze each hospital performance and also compare them.
