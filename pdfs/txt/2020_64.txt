Model of transport of medical emergency services using VANET networks in urban areas and implemented with computer intelligence
ABSTRACT
The advance of information and communication technologies, intelligent cities and traffic information systems, facilitates the use of new elements such as VANET in vehicular traffic, in addition to being able to facilitate and control the flow through the different routes that make up a city. It is important to take into account that thanks to these advances there must be circulation models, which facilitate vehicular traffic as well as help with the solution of problems that lead to the use of vehicles in a city. One of the important needs in a city is access to the health and well-being of its citizens, which with the help of an appropriate model will allow for a reduction in the time it takes to access the primary health needs that a patient must have in times of emergency. The present document presents a model for emergency vehicle traffic with characteristics of VANET networks, improved through computer tools which help with the reduction of processing times and optimization in the arrivals to emergency sites in urban areas.
