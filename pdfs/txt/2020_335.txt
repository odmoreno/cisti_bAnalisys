Comparative Analysis of the Use of Computer-Assisted Audit Tools by Internal and External Auditors in Portugal
ABSTRACT
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the audit procedures and to reduce the audit risk, the auditors have been adopting a set of technological tools that allow them to have a better performance. This study aims to compare the use of computerized tools that are used by the Portuguese Statutory Auditors (ROC) and by the Internal Auditors. In addition, the study also compares the audit procedures that are supported by these tools for both types of auditors and identifies which factors (age, sex, qualifications and professional experience) influence their use. In order to respond to these objectives, the data collected from the ROC and the internal auditors were analyzed through a questionnaire survey. We can observe a strong similarity of results regarding the use of these tools by the two types of respondents. We also concluded that the number of years of experience as an internal auditor is the only variable in the study that may influence the use of these tools.
