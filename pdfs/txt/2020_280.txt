Analysis of video surveillance images using computer vision in a controlled security environment
ABSTRACT
Facial analysis using video camera images proves to be a useful tool in the field of both personal and industrial security. By means of the facial analysis it is possible to develop applications based on the use of algorithms developed in Python programming languages and even with the support of Haar Cascade from the OpenCV library it is possible to solve problems caused by unexpected factors when analyzing an image. These factors can greatly influence image quality, whether it be poor lighting, shadows or even hardware problems. This document details the development of a facial recognition application for images from surveillance cameras, with the aim of providing security in a controlled environment.
