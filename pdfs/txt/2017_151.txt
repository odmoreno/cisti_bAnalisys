Knowledge management in higher education institutions for the generation of organizational knowledge
ABSTRACT
Knowledge management (KM) has emerged as a tool that allows the creation, use, distribution and transfer of knowledge in organizations. There are different frameworks that propose KM in the scientific literature. The majority of these frameworks are structured based on a strong theoretical background. This study describes a guide for the implementation of KM in a higher education institution (HEI) based on a framework with a clear description on the practical implementation. This framework is based on a technological infrastructure that includes enterprise architecture, business intelligence and educational data mining. Furthermore, a case study which describes the experience of the implementation in a HEI is presented. As a conclusion, the pros and cons on the use of the framework are analyzed.
