Hospital occupation rate analysis of the Brazilian federal university hospitals through business intelligence
ABSTRACT
The hospital area is constantly in need of care and attention. Because of its urgencies, it has vulnerabilities and risks that hinder the quality of hospital management. Technological management tools are effective in improving processes and strategic administration because they provide information reliability. The aim of this work is to propose to the Brazilian Federal University Hospitals (FUH's) the use of an open source Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Pentaho, to analyze the Hospital Occupancy Rate (HOR) and support clinical decision making. This paper describes BI and Pentaho, as well as the main points of the E-EFI-01 efficiency documentation established by the National Agency of Supplementary Health (NASH), with emphasis on the hospital indicator Occupancy Rate. Through Pentaho, is made the data extraction and the transformation, as well as loading them into the Data Warehouse (DW), all based on a relational database of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company (BHSC). After that, dimensional cubes are created for the generation of graphic panels in dashboards. It can be seen that most BHSC hospitals are not yet adequately using their operational beds, being outside the goal established by NASH. Several steps are taken to achieve efficient hospital administration, but the joint working of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions with the health area and its standards, provides a major step towards efficient hospital management.
