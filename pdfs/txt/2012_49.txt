A QoS solution for three-dimensional Full-HD H.264/MVC video transmission over IP networks
ABSTRACT
Tridimensional video streaming has recently drawn significant attention from users and content providers. This has led to an implementation of 3D transmission over IP networks that extend the legacy 2D solution to support multiple views within each image. More recently, a Multiview Video Coding amendment of the H.264 standard has been approved which, among other applications, is being used on the encoding of 3D content in Blu-ray discs. This latter solution has shown to be capable of improving the compression ratio when compared with the Side-by-Side encoding, by exploring inter-view redundancies. In this paper, we evaluate the challenges of encoding and transmitting 3D content in MVC, for Full HD content distribution over IP networks. We also design and evaluate a Weighted RED queuing mechanism for QoS capable networks based on the MVC structure is capable of improving the quality of the received video.
