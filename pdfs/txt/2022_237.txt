The Talent and (Essential) Role of People Analytics
ABSTRACT
Understanding how talent is attracted to companies and organizations is relevant. Additionally, it is critical to understand what keeps talent in organizations, something that Human Resource Management professionals have regularly debated over the past two decades. People, especially the younger and better prepared, change jobs today in a much more dynamic way than in the past, forcing organizations to face global competition, through strategies to maintain the high satisfaction of their teams and anticipate the intention talent output. The technology sector is one of the most targeted: the turnover of people is higher than in most sectors. This article seeks to understand how data analysis can help Human Resources Managers to perform their work better, either by knowing their teams or using people analytics to predict the change in their teams. It is hoped that this work will be a contribution to HRM and technology professionals, two areas in which it is essential that they dialogue in order to promote a better and more effective functioning of teams, whatever the sector is.
