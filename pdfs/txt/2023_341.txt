Analysis and design of an internal Top-Down network applying international standards
ABSTRACT
Telecommunications networks have become something essential within public or private companies, since they contribute to technological development. A network infrastructure with adequate cabling structured together with rules and standards enables the integration of multiple technologies and services. Currently, most institutions in Latin American countries do not apply norms, standards or good practices in their design, due to lack of knowledge or to save resources, without understanding that this generates an unreliable and unstable network infrastructure. Consequently, this study focuses on the design, architecture and administration of the network of a public institution in the city of Tulc√°n-Ecuador. The main objective of this proposal was the design of a network infrastructure that facilitates the administration of the network at a logical and physical level, taking into account the requirements and facilities of the institution. This network proposal applied the Top-Down Network Design By Cisco methodology to design a centralized, stable, flexible, and secure network. In addition, different international network design and management standards and regulations (ANSI/TIA/EIA/ISO) were used to generate a high-quality network.
