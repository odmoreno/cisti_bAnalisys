Profiling Accounts Political Bias on Twitter
ABSTRACT
Twitter has become a major platform to share ideas and promoting discussion on relevant topics. However, with a large number of users to resort to it as their primary source of information and with an increasing number of accounts spreading newsworthy content, a characterization of the political bias associated with the social network ecosystem becomes necessary. In this work, we aim at analyzing accounts spreading or publishing content from five different classes of the political spectrum. We also look further and study accounts who spread content from both right and left sides. Conclusions show that there is a large presence of accounts which disseminate right bias content although it is the more central classes that have a higher influence on the network. In addition, users who spread content from both sides are more actively spreading right content with opposite content associated with criticism towards left political parties or promoting right political decisions.
