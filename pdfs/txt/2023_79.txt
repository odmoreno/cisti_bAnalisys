Identification of trends to anticipate emergency services. : Method for hospitals popular emergency trends search
ABSTRACT
A method is proposed to obtain the most representative terms of the trends in Google Trends, which followed the increases in emergency care at the Gómez-Ulla hospital in Madrid in the period 2015-2021, based on the technique of Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR) which, for this study, uses a regressor algorithm (XGBoost Regressor) to select the most relevant keywords in Google Trends for the period 20152021, based on a set of initial terms recommended by the hospital’s healthcare professionals. The result is a much smaller group of words, which will be limited by the maximum number of simultaneous words that can be extracted from Google Trends. In this sense, it is possible to contribute to the identification of the most relevant trends or terms that represent growing trends on the Internet that allow anticipation of any unforeseen event in hospital emergency care services.
