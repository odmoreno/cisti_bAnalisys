Virtual Reconstruction of Objects by Point Cloud Capture to Measurement of Density Parameters Using Low Cost Device
ABSTRACT
It is studied in this project the viability to implement an application to virtually rebuild objects using a low-cost device. A rebuilding application was developed using interfaces provided by ReconstructMe SDK and a Kinect as a depth device. An analysis tool working on the Unity engine was also implemented, operating mainly on the terminology of the Editor Scripting with its C# API feature. This tool implements the capacity of obtaining the x, y and z measurement data of volumetric extremes of the virtual objects. The virtual reconstruction of objects proposal is tested by rebuilding of some specific objects, which are the closest resource; by manually conducting the device while trying to encircle the target object under limited spacial conditions. With results, the application faces some problems with the mesh fitting of some objects, however, the mesh quality is relatively good. Based on data measured with the analysis tool, it is achieved a good level of precision on the extreme measures besides that each rebuilding procedure can be made within a relatively fast time cost, around 25 s. Yet the proposal’s viability can be considered, based on its reconstruction capacity even if it’s using a low-cost device, considering that other 3D Scanner devices are generally expensive and may impose several limitations.
