Representation for a prototype of recommendation system of operation mode in copper mining
ABSTRACT
Process planning is an important task to achieve high performance in copper mining. This task involves mineral resources characteristics and operating conditions, to provide an optimal and realistic strategy for extraction and processing of copper. Planning the operating modes in the mining process requires a significant effort to generate the necessary information, analysis and design of these modes. When the operational plans are made, it is important to make decisions to select the most appropriate one, and in this context, an intelligent system that support the planning and decision making is very important for the mining industry of Chile. This paper describes the design of an ontological representation of knowledge to support the development of an intelligent recommendation system of modes of operating, to optimize the planning process of copper leaching in heaps.
