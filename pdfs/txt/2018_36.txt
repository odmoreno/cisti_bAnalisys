Discovering the CIO from the organizational cognition: A research with RepGrid
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to identify qualities that define a successful CIO, based on organizational cognition, and contingent on context and organizational maturity. A qualitative approach is used based on the Theory of Personal Constructs and the cognitive mapping tool called Repertory Grid. Three dimensions of qualities were identified, prominent among them the personal and interpersonal type. The study confirms the importance of the understanding of assumptions, values, expectations and individual beliefs in the interpretation and meaning of constructs related to the impact of information technologies in the organization.
