The methodology used was quantitative with a descriptive approach, there were 50 micro-enterprises that participated in this research, located in the city of Loja, Malacatos and Vilcabamba parishes. It was concluded that the family business in the tourism sector strives to carry out incremental innovation actions, that is, they make improvements in the characteristics of existing products and plan in the short term. On the other hand, it is argued that in order to manage radical innovation it is necessary to invest in innovation plus development, as well as in the acquisition of technology that favors the optimization of processes, products or services.
