ICT and risk management in the health system: the Ecuadorian case
ABSTRACT
In a digital era in which the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) transcends, risk management strategies must involve those that point out the information management. With this background, the objective of the research is to identify the role of ICT in risk management and to diagnose the use of ICT in emergency management, because of disasters. The results highlight the role of ICT in risk management and, therefore, in strengthening health systems.
