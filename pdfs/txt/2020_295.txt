Evaluation of simple space interpolation methods for the depth of precipitation: application for boyacá, colombia
ABSTRACT
Interpolation tools are used daily in hydrology and climatology. With the purpose to regionalize spot́s registration parameters, such as depth of precipitation, temperature, humidity, among others. The accuracy of these methods is not fully validated. This research presents a comparative study between the most used interpolation methods for the regionalization of hydrological and climatological parameters. Comparative analysis of spatial interpolation; it was carried out using the IDW, Kriging and Spline methods, for this the ARGIS software was used, because its widespread and widespread use. The depth of precipitation was considered as a parameter for the comparison. Accuracy was determined by cross validation. Also for the coefficient of determination and the comparison for visual errors such as "bull's eyes". The research was spatially restricted to a politically delimited region; Boyacá, Colombia, South America. The best method for spatial interpolation in this case was shown to be Spline.
