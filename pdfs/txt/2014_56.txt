Development of a method for direct conversion of a photogrammetric point cloud, to points of head's movement of a CNC milling machine: (or 3D printer), for reproduction and conservation of the architectural and archaeological heritage, applied to the reproduction of the wooden ornamentation in the "roshan"
ABSTRACT
New methodology for 3D machining process by CNC milling or 3D printer, in order to optimize the finishing of metric surface obtained from point clouds that generated by 3D scan using stereo-photogrammetry. Based on the final parameters of the milling cutter or extruder, we developed an application of algorithms directly on the point clouds without going through triangulation, using B-spline interpolation, avoiding "polyhedral conformation" of the result. This methodology is tested on the reproduction of an ornamental panel of the roshan element as a complementary technique for heritage conservation.
