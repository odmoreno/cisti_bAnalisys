Mobile application for the prediction of the expiration of food products refrigerated by warning sensors
ABSTRACT
In the present research work, a proposal has been made of a refrigerated food expiration prediction system, this consists of the development of a mobile application and the use of warning sensors. The general architecture used is exposed, as well as the specific architectures generated, shaped by the architectures: Client-Mobile Application, Client Communication, Mobile-Server Application, Sensor-Server Client, and the existing flow of user interaction. The developed system is subjected to an evaluation in which 40 families from two cities of Ecuador participate, where, after the application of the USE questionnaire and a semi-structured survey, the results of the 92.5% acceptance of the need for a system like the one proposed in this research work.
