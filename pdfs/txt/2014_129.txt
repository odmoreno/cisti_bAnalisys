ABSTRACT
Most of today's emerging professions come from digital business sectors. In these various sectors of activity research shows that managers of organizations understand the impact of online reputation crisis, but show a remarkable lack of strategic vision and resources to anticipate them. Shortcomings were also detected to react to them via digital tools such as social networks, ICT dissemination tools, etcâ€¦ In this article, that is based on a study of 336 managers (CEOs or Managing Directors, Directors, Middle Management and Technical) in the province of Barcelona (Spain), are detected, using statistical techniques of crossing clusters, aspects of behavior related to strategy and tactics. The result is a classification of strategic behavior of firms that indicates different levels of development as far as corporate reputation online is concerned.
