Critical sucess factors for cloud-based ERP systems deployment: A study with Brazilian companies
ABSTRACT
The ERP deployment in the cloud-computing model is an alternative to decrease implementation costs as well as legislation compliance. Consequently, this model of deployment can change the traditional recommendations of critical success factors during the life cycle. Based on the selection of 17 most cited critical success factors according to the literature, we perform a case study with the three Brazilian companies. We interviewed information technology managers and consultants engaged on the deployment in order to verify the critical success factors impact. Among the 17 studied factors, 5 pointed to more impact in a deployment regarding the cloud-based model and deserve discussion. The contribution is to provide a theoretical framework for companies and consultants drive the projects concerning the factors that can determine success or failure for cloud-based ERP systems.
