Augmented Reality System for the Assistance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
ABSTRACT
This article proposes the development of a virtual and augmented reality environment to assist in the assembly and maintenance of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Taking the lack of technological knowledge as the research gap, the study provides researchers and practitioners with new solutions through the familiarization and guided assistance of a UAV. The system is based on the user tracing to locate the position of the hands and validate in real-time if the actions performed are correct. In the interface can also access to virtualized environment so that the user define a route with the movement of his hands and immediately the UAV follow the path marked from the beginning to the end, the errors are displayed on the same screen to verify the stability of control.
