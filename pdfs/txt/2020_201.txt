Performance Analysis of Financial Institution Operations in a NoSQL Columnar Database
ABSTRACT
The advent of Big Data has brought the need to analyse large volumes of data. The Hadoop ecosystem has been used to store and process this Big Data. Hadoop is composed of different frameworks, such as: HBase, a NoSQL column storage structure database; Hive framework to develop the data warehouse in distributed storage with SQL, used in Business Intelligence; Sqoop, to transfer data between Apache Hadoop and relational database structures; and others. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of the Hadoop Ecosystem in a financial system to reduce the processing time that its transactions require. Results show that the Hadoop ecosystem improves the processing time in that financial database.
