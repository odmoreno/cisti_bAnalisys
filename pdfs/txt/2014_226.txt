Do moodle reports and logs meet the needs of educational supervision?
ABSTRACT
We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study in order to evaluate the usage of the software named Moodle Learning Management Software (LMS) with the purpose of educational auditing and its functionality. The study was performed over a practice of education, which deals with PBL activities with a networked learning approach. Course subjects were the instructional principles and methods. Students enrolled into the course from Hacettepe University Faculty of Education, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology in the academic year 2012â€“2013. The course was delivered via the Moodle LMS platform. The data stored in the database of the software was extracted to make auditing evaluations about the software, and auditing techniques were applied. A comparison was made between the data received from the software's modules that could be used for auditing purposes and the data on which the auditing techniques were applied after extracting and tutor-oriented evaluations were performed. The evaluations regarding the monitoring, assessing and managing of the teaching process in the activities of the Networked PBL of Moodle software's auditing function were made in consideration of the findings. It was concluded that Moodle was sufficient for meeting the basic data requirements for educational auditing, its modules alone did not have Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) function; a CAATs add-in, which would be created or used for fulfilling the educational requirements, would be useful.
