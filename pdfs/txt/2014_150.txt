The use of computational tools in teaching pharmacology: A systematic review on the topic
ABSTRACT
In pharmacology, one of the problems found in teaching is precisely the existing abstract concepts, because it has chemistry as a requirement for your understanding. Due to these abstract concepts, students try to end difficult to visualize and understand these concepts. To try to reduce the degree of abstraction, was started to use computational tools for teaching and learning. This paper presents a systematic literature review of computational tools which are being used for teaching Pharmacology. This systematic review included only studies published in 2008 and 2013 in three different databases and it was noted that are no many computational tools directed to the area of pharmacology.
