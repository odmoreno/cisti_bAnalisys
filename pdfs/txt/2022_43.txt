A Multiagent System Based on Game Theory and Machine Learning Algorithms to Mediate Civil Actions of Contracts in the Consumer Relationship
ABSTRACT
Mediation is a conflict resolution process where the parties involved, through an impartial, independent and autonomous mediator, seek to reach a mutually beneficial consensus. It is a more agile and less tiring solution, avoiding overloading the judiciary with cases that can be resolved through a culture of dialogue. In this context, it is necessary, given the increase in demand for this type of process, to provide computational solutions that can help the mediator and the parties to reach a consensus. In accordance with the competitive nature of the process, therefore, this study presents the prototype of a multi-agent system which, using game theory negotiation strategies and machine learning algorithms, seeks to simulate the construction of agreements, mainly in matters of contracts and consumer relations.
