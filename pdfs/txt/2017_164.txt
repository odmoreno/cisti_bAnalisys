Animation and adults: Between the virtual and social reality
ABSTRACT
In our modern societies, the reality that we live is continuously transformed by technology, different ways of communication and multiple information, creating a (new) virtual reality. How is our social world linked to the virtual world? Animated films may help us to discover and understand this interface, in which their boundaries may not be clear. What we call human reality approaches fantasy realms in the virtual worlds. The aim of this study is to explore what animated films transmit to an adult population - what they feel and what they value in animated films, trying to understand the importance of animated films in adults' lives. It is also intended to explore which technologies are most used to consult information about animated films, and which are the most important reasons for choosing an animated film, instead of other styles of movies. Our study consists in the development of two focus groups, with adult participants, between 25 and 35 years. This study is part of a master's thesis that is under development. Through the focus group we aim to obtain data and gather knowledge about our research topic. The results will help us to verify the most relevant factors and indicating the items to include in a questionnaire that will be used in a next study.
