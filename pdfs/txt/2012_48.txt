Web-enabled decision support systems for precision viticulture
ABSTRACT
Last years the introduction of technology in agriculture and viticulture improved management processes and agricultural production. Precision viticulture aims to correctly handle the inherent variability of crops, increase profit and reduce environmental impact. Their use depends on technological advances such as wireless sensor networks and decision support systems, which should help the grower in making decisions on issues such as application of inputs, control of irrigation or pest control. This paper is a review of techniques for design and development of Web-Enabled Decision Support Systems that show the importance of these technologies in development of current information systems in this field. Finally, it includes a proposal for service-oriented software architecture for the design of a system for decision support systems for precision viticulture. Finally, include a proposal for Event-Driven software Architecture to design a decision support system in the field of precision viticulture.
