Vital signs monitoring and management using mobile devices
ABSTRACT
Constant breakthroughs in medical sensor technology and mobile devices fields, combined with growing wireless communication capabilities, have made possible the emergence of new health monitoring paradigms. The ever-increasing features of PDAs and smartphones make them a vital component in innovative health monitoring systems. In this paper, we introduce a handset mobile monitoring and management system for non-critical patients, developed as complement to a complete vital signs monitoring project (MOHLL). The main purpose of this system is to provide physicians with real-time visualization of the patients' vital parameters, namely the ECG trace, heart rate, and body temperature, through an Internet-connected PDA.
