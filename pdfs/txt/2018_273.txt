Factors that help in the implantation of agile methods: A systematic mapping of the liteature
ABSTRACT
Agile methods have emerged as an alternative to traditional management methods, due to the great market pressure on innovation and shorter time frames. Companies and institutions report that in the use of agile methods, they had benefits such as cost reduction, greater engineering discipline, and greater project visibility. However, there are some barriers to be faced during the adoption of agile methods, such as changes in organizational culture and resistance to change. In this context, the objective of this study was to carry out a systematic mapping in order to identify the studies that involve the mapping in order to identify the studies that involve the implementation of agile methods, as well as which practices and factors contribute to its implementation, benefits in the use of methodologies and what difficulties were reported in the studies.
