Using Genially to design flashcards to teach English at GBE Elementary
ABSTRACT
Today the importance of the English language has to do with the age of the information society. And the new citizens are the ones who must master these communicative skills. For this reason, this project aims to be a benchmark for a change in the educational paradigm by proposing as an alternative the use of digital material in the classroom and even outside it to be a formal learning that meets the urgent needs of the children of the UEPJL, and if it can improve vocabulary learning in an innovative and effective way through the design of digital flashcards using the Genially tool. It contains literature on the subject as well as the analysis of the data that the surveys made to the students show about their opinion regarding the flashcards, which is satisfactory in their final conclusions even if they do not know about the ICT tool for their design.
