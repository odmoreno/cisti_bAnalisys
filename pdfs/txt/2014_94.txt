A symbiotic simulation platform for agent-based quadcopters
ABSTRACT
Small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining the attention of researchers around the world, due to their versatility and performance in both indoor and outdoor applications. The whole project aims to specify and implement a symbiotic simulation platform to assist the design, development and testing of UAVs that use a quad-rotor configuration. Additionally, in this paper we firstly discuss the integration of two software components to build the simulation environment: Jason, an agent-oriented platform for the development and simulation of multi-agent systems and the jME3 game engine, used for 3-dimensional simulations of the models. Further, we describe the implementation of the physical multi-rotor system and present some preliminary results, as well as the description of the symbiotic simulation platform.
