Risk-based resource allocation applying AHP-TOPSIS
ABSTRACT
This study successfully proposes a risk mitigation model for the allocation of human resources in a law firm, combining human criteria validated through AHP and technical criteria optimized through TOPSIS. At the same time, it follows the risk-based resource allocation framework. A single indicator named HA (Human Allocation Factor). It is a universal indicator and can be used by the entire academic community or by professionals in decision-making processes for the allocation of people in any process. The study suggests it is possible to optimize the risk of attendance rates, legal and labor turnover, using a simple numerical indicator (HA). HA is an optimization measure, if the original value is used. In this case, it must be at least equal to or greater than 0.5. The output of the actual process was 0.41. The reverse of this measure, that is, 0.59 represents the measure of risk in current processes. It needs to be below 0.5. This means that the current process was at high risk and with low optimization. The first process that needed to be optimized was the Patrimony team. Then, the processes involving the Residual and Skilled Labor Service. The managers validated these results and acted in the processes indicated by the HA measure, being successful with that.
