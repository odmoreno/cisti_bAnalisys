Games as a rehabilitation perspective of stroke patients
ABSTRACT
Among the diseases that cause disability, is stroke. The stroke patient needs physiotherapy for functional reinstatement. The games can be used as resources to boost rehabilitation and motivate more patients with stroke. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a rehabilitation program associated with the intervention with games improves recovery of stroke patients. The research consisted of a case study, in which two patients underwent a standard physical therapy program (control group) and two, physical therapy and training with games (intervention group). Both groups performed 32 sessions, lasting one hour each session. Patients were assessed by Fugl Meyer scale of the arm, Box and Block Test and Functional Independence Measure. Regarding the scale Fugl Meyer, the games group achieved superior results, as the motor function in the control group, but there were no significant differences between them. The same happened to the parameters of the MIF test and Box and Block, comparing the pre- and postintervention. In this study, the use of games proved to be such a beneficial strategy as conventional therapy in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The small sample size may have obscured a potential advantage of games compared to conventional Physiotherapy. This technique, combined with physical therapy, is a promising method in the motor recovery after stroke, it is also a favorable and enriching form of stimulus, not only the physical, but multisensory the patient.
