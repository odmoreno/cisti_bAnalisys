Information and Communication Technologies and Poverty
ABSTRACT
Information and communication technology (ICT) has a significant impact in the fight against poverty as these tools give the less advantaged the ability to access information, resources and education that were previously unattainable. ICTs can also be a tool to reduce the digital divide and allow the poor to access information resources that were previously unattainable. The objective of this research is to analyze the influence of the importation of ICTs, the use of the Internet and the increase in the population on poverty rates. Focusing particularly on the role of ICTs in reducing poverty. The analysis suggests that ICTs will play a role primarily as communication technology rather than information production or processing technology. Using an Auto Regressive Vector time series model, it was verified that ICTs reduce poverty in the short term. The use of the Internet shows two aspects, a possible decrease in poverty in the short term, while, with a larger population, the poverty rate also increases. As a policy recommendation, policies are suggested that improve access to technology as a key to reducing poverty.
