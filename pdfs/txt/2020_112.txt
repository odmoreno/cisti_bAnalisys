The assessment for the learning of mathematics mediated by mobile applications
ABSTRACT
In the teaching-learning process of Mathematics, the evaluation is fundamental factor and requires new mechanisms from the academic community and strategies that not only reduce stress levels that generate the evaluation Activities, but also motivate him to be evaluated and most importantly to the appropriation of new learning cognitive type as affective. This paper describes the results by incorporating a mobile application, in the evaluation process in a university institution.
