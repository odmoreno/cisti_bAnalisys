A Model for Knowledge Management in the e-Learning and Innovation Unit od the Polytechnic of Porto
ABSTRACT
This research article aims to present the results of the case study on knowledge management at the e-Learning and Innovation Unit of the Polytechnic of Porto (EIPP). Knowledge management is a complex and multidisciplinary concept supported by technologies and processes, whose objective is to promote the creation, sharing and application of organizational knowledge. To be able to have an efficient management, knowledge management models are created adapted to organizations that apply practical measures that, when put into practice, enhance knowledge. It appears that the evolution in the improvement of organizational knowledge management processes is not necessarily a complex and time-consuming process, sometimes it is possible to achieve high levels of effectiveness with the implementation of small procedures supported by communication technologies and network collaboration.
