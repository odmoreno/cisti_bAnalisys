Observatories as Transparency Instruments for Projects
ABSTRACT
The observation, in the context of the organization and the projects, has been defined, in the recent literature, by the transparency construct, and the development of tools to systematize the transparency has presented as a challenge to the organizations. In this sense, the observatories are presented as information systems that support the collection, organization, storage, analysis, and observation publications, providing transparency. In this scenario, this research had the purpose of discuss the observatories construction as transparency mechanism to projects. To this, a set of three pilot projects of projects observatories were developed. This research is classified as an exploratory research with a qualitative approach, performed from participant observation and archival research. The construction these observatories made possible to know and test the concept of projects observatories in practice, in addition to identifying its characteristics and variability. It was also identified an initial set of functions and components of the observatories, in addition of watching the benefits and difficulties of its construction.
