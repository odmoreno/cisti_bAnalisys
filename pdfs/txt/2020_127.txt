Security For Applications With Multiple Users
ABSTRACT
Online web applications provide free services very convenient for collaborative editions, that is, share and store files for multiple users. Suppliers not only have access to users' files, but also control their access, transmission and storage mechanisms. Thus, the data may be at risk of interception, extraction and even manipulation by third parties. In this work, an algorithm is proposed that could help preserve the privacy of user data in collaborative environments. The development involves an encryption mechanism that does not interfere with the control mechanisms used by the owner, developing a code that blocks unauthorized users. This algorithm demonstrates how several users with a shared key can collaborate and transparently edit a document without displaying the text directly. The application is designed to work on any operating system and its application can be verified for several browsers.
