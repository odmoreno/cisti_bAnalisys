Resistence in Software Process Improvement: A classification proposal of causes, resistance models and gamification
ABSTRACT
Software development companies are interested in best practices implementation looking for the improvement of their processes and software products. However, software process improvement (SPI) initiatives are complex because search to ameliorate the conditions and behavior of the professionals involved in software development. For this reason, indicators about change resistance in SPI initiatives show that underestimating the complexity of a change process and its consequent resistance to change weakens the results of such improvement. Therefore, there is a growing search of strategies for reduce the change resistance and as a result of this search, gamification is being used in this context because it helps to modify and influence the behavior of people and thus achieve the proposed goals. Motivated by the gamification benefits, in this article we propose a classification of the models of change resistance found in the literature looking to define a strategy that facilitate SPI initiatives implementation. Such classification proposal will be an input for the gamification use to decrease change resistance common causes in SPI initiatives. This classification is the result of a systematic literature review and the work with an experts group using transitivity law for relating models, causes and gamification principles.
