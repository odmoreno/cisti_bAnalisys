A Routing Approach in SDN Environments
ABSTRACT
The SDN (Software-Defined Networking) concept offers a set of protocols and technologies that facilitate the management and maintenance of computer networks. This article presents an innovative proposal for a prototype of an advanced traffic routing system, based on SDN technology. This prototype offers several mechanisms to deal with traffic routing, including the calculation of shortest paths and immediate injection of routes, the ability of immediate convergence after link failures, protection of ISP infrastructure links or routers, reaction to different load levels on the network, the ability to forward individual traffic flows by specific routes and the multiplexing of the topology by different virtual networks. Thus, the developed prototype presents a traffic routing solution that adapts and responds effectively to current and emerging challenges posed by a vast field of applications inherent to actual information systems and technologies.
