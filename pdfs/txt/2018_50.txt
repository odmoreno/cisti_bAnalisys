Internet of Things: Factors that influence its adoption among Chilean SMEs
ABSTRACT
This research represents a first attempt to explore the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in Chilean companies. Its objective is to determine the factors that influence the adoption of this technology using the unified model of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as a theoretical framework. An electronic survey was applied to ICT managers of small and medium-sized companies in different areas and the intention to use IoT was analyzed. The results indicate that the intention to adopt this technology is explained by the constructs of UTAUT in 68%, being social influence and facilitating conditions the key factors to explain this phenomenon. The performance expectancy, despite being significant, has a contrary effect to the intention of use as perceived by the responsible of ICT in Chilean SMEs.
