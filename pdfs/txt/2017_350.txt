Secondary information was available in the official database of the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INEC) [1], and the data is 2014. The present work corresponds to non-experimental cross-sectional research because the data were collected in a single moment, its purpose is to describe variables and analyze their incidence and interrelation at a given moment [2]. The most relevant data reflects that 41% of Ecuadorian companies invest in technology, thereby strengthening internal communication strategies based on the use of TICs as the main axis of organizational development.
