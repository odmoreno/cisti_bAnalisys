Potential and dynamic value measuring
ABSTRACT
The present work explores the value creation and co-creation like a system. The work proposes a co-creation model with systemic archetypes that allow the capture and measure of both potential and dynamic value. According to Service Dominant Logic, value creation in a collaborative way is based on the customer's experience, value in exchange and value in use, key aspects in this approach. A phenomenological analysis is used in this work for the value creation both from designers and customers. This approach broadens the scope of value creation and measure beyond designer proposition emphasizing on value co-creation in a social context, where service as a skill and knowledge transmission, transform those last aspects in fundamental operant resources for value creation in use. Results show that the methodology ADES allows not only the value capture and measure but also a profound comparison between potential and dynamic value to support future strategies on the service design.
