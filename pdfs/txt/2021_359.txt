Information Systems Function and Governance in Portuguese Organizations
ABSTRACT
This work seeks to raise awareness of the repositioning of the function of information systems in a broader spectrum, evolving from the management of information systems to its governance in conjunction with the governance of the organization.The articulation at the level of governance should contribute to the longed-for alignment between business and information technologies, which insists on persisting as one of the major problems for the function of information systems. By studying the form that information systems governance takes in leading companies in Portugal, the challenge that companies face for their digital transformation is highlighted, namely small and medium-sized companies, the overwhelming majority of which do not even have one qualified professional in Information Systems and Technologies. However, there is a clear need for information systems governance, concluding with research challenges and opportunities.
