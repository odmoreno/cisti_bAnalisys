Adaptive control measures and thermal comfort : Input parameters for IoT devices
ABSTRACT
Thermal comfort can be defined as the ‘condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment.’, and adaptive control measures comprise an adjustment to indoor environmental conditions based on occupant preferences, behavior, and feedback. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) in thermal comfort and adaptive control measures has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency and occupant comfort in buildings. The adoption of the Working-from-home modality by several institutions and companies during and after the 2020 pandemic, accelerated the development of even more advanced and effective solutions in this area. This study, in its first phase, seeks to identify input parameters related to adaptive control measures adopted by the same occupants in two work environments (office building and residences) to promote personal thermal comfort contributing to the development of individual devices and IoT applications related to thermal comfort monitoring.
