Towards the process of identifying the strategies of self-directed learners in ubiquitous environments
ABSTRACT
Understanding the learning strategies conceived by self-directed learners has become a major challenge to be found in contexts supported by sub-domains of learning. For this objective to be achieved it is necessary to understand the different approaches that dimension the phenomenon, to explore the technologies created for this purpose and to discuss the results and limitations obtained through the research. Therefore, this paper aims to present an ongoing doctoral research that investigates the current solutions recommended by the literature to make it possible to create a process of identification of strategies of self-directed learners in ubiquitous learning environments.
