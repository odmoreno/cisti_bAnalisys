The impact of the introduction of logistics management systems in an organization: A case study in a hospital center
ABSTRACT
Information is an essential resource for the success of enterprise organizations making the adoption of technologies that provide information to support decision-making processes increasingly relevant. The Information System (IS) is an integral part of this process since it provides and processes information that allows one to opt for the most appropriate decisions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of a logistics management system in a Portuguese hospital center, namely, its acceptance by users and its logistic impact. Logistics management plays a key role in making the desired products and services available, at the right time and place, ensuring greater efficiency for the organization to remain financially competitive and productive. While the principle holds true for all organizations, health care institutions have specificities that need to be taken into account. In this study, the Enterprise System Success (ESS) model will be used to compare management and operational perceptions.
