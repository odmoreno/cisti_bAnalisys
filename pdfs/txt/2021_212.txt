Advanced web methodology for flexible web development
ABSTRACT
Web development is one of the ways to contribute to the digitization of organizations. However, being a relevant area, it has the contribution of countless companies and people worldwide. This high number of contributions necessarily leads to several trends and forms of development. This article explores one of these trends, namely the use of react on the frontend and nodejs on the backend. In terms of the data flow between the frontend and the backend, the GraphQL specification was used. The database is supported by Postgresql. The architecture and organization of development is crucial to find generic baseline sequences that support cross-cutting development between different information systems. This was the focus of the development in order to easily change the data structure and reflect this change in the frontend, without the need for maintenance in the code. This is a key step to allow the next stage, namely the development supported by advanced techniques based on artificial intelligence (this stage is under development and will be described in a next article by the authors).
