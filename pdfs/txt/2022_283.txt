Readability and letters
ABSTRACT
In the present, there are different indices that measure the difficulty level of reading a text, i.e. the readability of a text. Different studies have been made on the frequency of occurrence of letters in several languages, but as we know there are not thorough studies on the occurrence of letters according to the readability of a text. The main objective of the present work is to study the frequency of occurrence of letters in a text according to its legibility. This occurrence will be approached from two points of view. First, through the so-called power indices of game theory. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a game is associated with a text and the influence or power of each letter will be analysed by means of the so-called power indices of the game theory. Thus, we present a new application of game theory. Second, by means of basic statistics to study relative frequency of letters in a text.
