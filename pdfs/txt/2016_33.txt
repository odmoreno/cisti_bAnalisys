Mobile health as a tool for behaviour change in chronic disease prevention: A systematic literature review
ABSTRACT
Customized information, dynamic interactions and innovative technologies may motivate the individuals to adopt an active approach to look after their own health. The mobile health is considered one of the most important platforms, able to influence human behaviour. This literature review aims to identify the main behavioural theories underlying the influence of mHealth technologies on behaviour change, for the prevention of noncomunicable chronic diseases, in developed countries. To answer the question: What behaviour change theories and models, support mHealth interventions, in chronic disease prevention? - was conducted a systematic and comprehensive review, combining experimental studies with theoretical perspectives, in order to identify the main theoretical approaches. The databases consulted for the present research were: Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scielo and PubMed, for an analysis period from 2011 to January 2016. They were identified as principal theories underpinning this research the Social Cognitive Theory, the Transtheoretical Model and the Chronic Care Model.
