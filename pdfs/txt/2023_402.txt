Cognitive accessibility in digital environments for people with autism : Is there evidence for specific guidelines?
ABSTRACT
There is a digital gap in the group of people with autism that makes us consider studying cognitive accessibility in digital environments. The present work carries out a systematic review that allows determining the specificity of the recommendations of cognitive accessibility in digital environments for this group and that allows evaluating the level of empirical evidence that supports the different recommendations. The results obtained and some future recommendations to meet the needs of the group of people with autism and to work on a real digital inclusion are shown. It concludes with the real existence of differences in access to information in digital environments between neurotypical people and people with autism, and the need for more research and higher methodological quality to develop specific guidelines and recommendations to make them more cognitively accessible.
