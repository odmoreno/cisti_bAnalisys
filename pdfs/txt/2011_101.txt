@Sensor - Mobile application to monitor a WSN
ABSTRACT
Due to the growth of potential of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), now becomes possible to use this technology in various new generation services such as monitor environment characteristics like temperature, humidity, among others. WSNs are emerging as a new paradigm, gathering information in a collaborative way, where independent sensor nodes collect and share information. In the last few years ubiquitous computing popularity has grown considerably, ambient intelligence and home automation systems are having a good public acceptance. In this context, we developed a mobile application to remotely monitor one WSN, installed at a customer's home. The application's main goal is to interact with a WSN, allowing a user to consult sensor states and receive sensor alerts. Sensor alerts will be received, in case a sensor's threshold value, exceeds the limit. Therefore the user will be notified whenever there are changes in the WSN. Apart the WSN, a base station is also needed for keeping the state of the WSN, store sensor's information and enable communication between the WSN and the developed mobile application via Web Services. This way and having a network connection, the user can check the state of any WSN component, anytime, anywhere. The Android platform was chosen to implement our application, since it is having a great acceptance and continued growth in the mobile market.
