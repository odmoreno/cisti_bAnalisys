UML modeling tools: Assessment in perspective of users
ABSTRACT
Modeling tools serve to guide and discipline the software development process during the design process. However, such tools are not fully explored from a functional point of view, either the complexity of the subject matter or the usability thereof. This study proposes to evaluate the use of three system modeling tools, through a study using students of the Postgraduate Program in Applied Informatics to the Organizations. The objective of the study was to evaluate the usability of three tools that allow system modeling using UML notation. Are presented studies on the levels of acceptance and use of the analyzed tools. Based on the preliminary results of this study, it was observed that the Visio tool has better usability and functionality than the other tools.
