Organizational impact of implementing an ERP module in Portuguese SME
ABSTRACT
Pursuant decree law no. 197/2012 and 198/2012 published by Portuguese government, whereby it states that any company with turnover higher than 100.000 â‚¬ is obliged to possess an electronic billing software, this article seeks to identify and evaluate the impacts of an ERP implementation in Portuguese SME. Through both exploratory interviews performed to three entrepreneurs and questionnaire performed to Portuguese SME, it was possible to understand the reality of the implementation of a system of this nature, as well as identifying both advantages and disadvantages. The work performed allowed to conclude that although it represents a significant investment regarding time and costs to companies, the ERP implementation brings benefits in various perspectives, both in short and long term, as well as in internal and external company's relations.
