Coloso: A development environment centered process and intent
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a process-centered development environment called Coloso. This platform was developed in order to integrate different languages and components that help support some of the most relevant proposals regarding Software Engineering reinforcement. These proposals are directly supported within Coloso. Unlike other process-centered environments, a novel element of the proposal presented herein is the integration of emergent concepts that favor new ways of thinking about software. These emergent concepts are intended to narrow the gap between engineers' thoughts and actual developments.
