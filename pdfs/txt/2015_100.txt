Continuous integration using cloud computing
ABSTRACT
Nowadays systems can evolve quickly, and to this growth is associated, for example, the addiction of new features, or even the change of system perspective, required by the stakeholders. Consequently, these cause an increase in the number of developed tests. Run a large battery of tests sequentially can take hours. However, tests can run faster in a distributed environment with rapid availability of pre-configured systems, such as Cloud Computing. This paper pretends to demonstrate some scenarios on the implementation of the practice Continuous Integration (CI) in Information Systems, with software tests performed on Cloud Computing. The main goal is explore the most of capacities that CI practice gives, for automating the build and testing in a Information System.
