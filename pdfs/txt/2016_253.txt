Perceived quality of life among first-year health students engaged in problem based learning and traditional teaching model: First-year students of allied health sciences
ABSTRACT
Quality of Life (QoL) is a broad measure that captures the extent to which personal satisfaction with overall life circumstances is achieved. The transition to college can be a challenging event due to unique environment changes. So first-year students are special vulnerable to stress which has been associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including general and health-related QoL. Difficulties in integrating the system are common, among them are adjustment problems to learning and teaching models. This work focus on first-year students of a higher education health school, were coexist mainly two teaching models: problem based learning (PBL) and traditional (TTM). This study aims to compare the two models concerning QoL. The results suggest that QoL is good in both models, but TTM scored higher values in each dimension of QoL. Regarding personal accomplishment feelings, PBL students had significantly higher values. Our findings highlight the importance of the pedagogical model on student well-being, especially on beliefs concerning their abilities, expectations of success and self-efficacy already on 1st year.
