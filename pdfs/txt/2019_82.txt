Smart Governance in european smart cities
ABSTRACT
Smart Governence as its roots in e-government, in the principles of good governance, and in the assumptions of citizens' participation and involvement in public decision-making and is considered one of the six main characteristics of smart cities. The present investigation was intended to answer the question: “What smart governance practices are being implemented in European smart cities” through an extensive literature review and content analysis of the websites of six European smart cities: Amsterdam; Barcelona; Copenhagen; Lisbon; Manchester and Stockholm. The objective was to identify the presence of factors related with eparticipation; e-services; and the functioning of local public administration on the city's websites. It was concluded that all the smart cities analyzed presented some factors related with smart governance, but with different levels of development and application.
