A Case Study on the use of Gamification in the Flipped Classroom
ABSTRACT
The present article corresponds to the result of an internship at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança. After accomplishing a systematic literature review looking for the clarification of the main concepts of gamification and flipped classroom, it was performed a case study which main purpose was to identify and analyze how students react to the use of educational games as diagnostic or formative evaluation. Many tools were evaluated, but only four were chosen, which were: Kahoot!, Socrative, Quizizz and Nearpods. Subsequently, these tools were distributed to the third year of the course of management degree through Google Classroom and shared with other professors of the European community through the platform AduLeT (Advanced use of Learning Technologies in Higher Education). That contributed to share and reuse strategies to face the world’s current scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We can affirm henceforth that all the use experiences, which related a learning method with one of the tools referred, showed satisfactory results involving a greater dynamic and interest during the classes.
