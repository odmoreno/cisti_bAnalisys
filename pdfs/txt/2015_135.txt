Transparency in the national assemblies of Portuguese speaking African countries: Adapting the bungeni parliamentary system â€” The case study of Sao Tome and Principe
ABSTRACT
The Internet exists in our reality as the fastest way to provide information, whether institutional orfrom the so-called social networks. Thus the E-Government services began to emerge globally in the last decade and are now taken for granted in modern society. However, this is not the reality in all countries. The work described in this article aims to bring attention and attempts to fill a technological need in the Lusophone African countries. This need is due to a low investment on the implementation of E-government services. On this assumption, the article intents to demonstrate the case study of an application in a E-Government Parliamentary scenario inside the National Assembly of Sao Tome and Principe. The implementation of such a service allows for a increased efficiency in documental management on the Assembly and also provides a degree of transparency in parliamentary activities, which would once be impossible to convey.
