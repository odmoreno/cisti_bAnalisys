Electronic health record in the assessment of aphasia post CVA
ABSTRACT
The population ageing in line with the growth of chronic illness increase the cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), therefore the number of aphasia's cases also increases. In Portugal the use of information systems that allow the record and access to clinical process is still very reduced, particularly in speech therapy. This study aims to systematize the procedures in aphasia's area and to define an information model that facilitates the record of assessment in this area. In order to conceptualise the information model the authors used the results obtained in the bibliographic revision and the data of the questionnaire performed to speech therapists. The validation results show that the information structure is appropriate to Portuguese reality in aphasia's area.
