Factors affecting the successful implementation of IT Governance: A study using Structural Equations applied to the Banking Industry
ABSTRACT
This article aimed to present the factors that most influence the successful implementation of information technology governance. An analysis of 15 years of contributions from the literature was carried out (2005-2020), and several factors were found that are directly related to this superior performance. To discover which factors had the most significant degree of influence, an exploratory research was carried out, with a quantitative approach via equations and variance in two Brazilian public banking institutions. 123 professionals evaluated the questionnaire, and the results revealed that the perception of employees is of vital importance for the success of governance in information technology, with an influence of 53.3%. It is only through this perception that the actions taken institutionally can impact IT governance's satisfactory performance. Among the factors that stood out the most is Business Policies (0.699). Business Policies are related to strategic decision-making processes and corporate policies information, directly affecting Corporate Governance and, consequently, IT Governance. Thus, for companies to improve their IT Governance, they must act to improve the process of defining and reviewing guidelines and standards geared to business policies to improve the conduct of organizational processes, strengthen the "Business Policies" indicator, and positively influences the performance of IT Governance. Although it has not reached the desired level of significance, it is expected to be closer to the indicators "Competence Management" and "Organization and its structures".
