Collecting data about television contents in the OntoTV system
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, digital television and the in particular the terrestrial one, offers a great variety of digital television contents and channels. However, the available information about the broadcasted programs is scarce and not always immediately accessible. It is necessary to develop new strategies that retrieve all the possible television content information, in order to improve the viewers' experience. The main objective of this research is the definition of a new input module for the OntoTV content management system, that (1) collects information from various existing platforms, (2) enriches it by accessing additional resources, (3) integrates into a single document all the relevant data, and (4) represents this information in the knowledge base by using ontologies. Then, it is possible to perform advanced operations over the stored data, like more precise queries for the user.
