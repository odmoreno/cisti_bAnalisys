A methodology for quality assurance for business process modeling with BPMN: A case study for the SIGEPE software
ABSTRACT
During the development of computer systems, business process modeling is a phase that delivers important firsthand inputs for requirements engineering. The goal of business process mapping is to understand, improve and organize the activities of the process to ensure efficient and correct implementation. Quality in business process modeling can decisively influence the software quality. Internal quality analysis is made in-house, for the development process, while external quality analysis is made for the final product and satisfaction of the end consumer. Quality assurance comes from quality attributes verified with checklists in iterative cycles. Then, process mapping contributes both to producing consistent artifacts to better communications within the project. This article presents a methodology for quality assurance of process modeling that can be applied for the development of large computer systems. The methodology was used in a complex case study, with the mapping of business processes using BPMN, to develop a system for human resources management within the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management (MPOG) in Brazil.
