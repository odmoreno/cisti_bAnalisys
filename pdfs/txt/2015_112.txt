Software engineering's implementation in a virtual world's software for education
ABSTRACT
The aim of this PhD thesis from the program named “Software Engineering based on reusable components, with human computer interface application”, is to enhance the learning experience for university students at the Information Systems Engineering and Software careers from two local universities and middle level school. The enhanced experience could be possible by the interaction with scenarios created with open source multi-user 3D application server and developed with the requirements of the instructor and the teaching strategies adopted. The evolution of the educational use of the Virtual Worlds, the difficulties and the opportunities discovered that this kind of software offers to the task of teaching, supported by the software engineering are listed.
