Architecture proposal for the analysis of chemical components of the soil through the use of emerging technologies
ABSTRACT
In recent years, chemical fertilizers have been used in agriculture and gardening as soil nutrients, however, their excessive handling brings side-effects such as soil contamination. Its constant application whether in short or long-term, could face up and be problem for the environment. Under this scenario, this work proposes an architecture whose components allow analyzing the level of soil contamination, using low-cost devices such as: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Xinwoer IP68 ABS Soil NPK Sensor and the Liquid PH 0-14. The aim is to be able to understand the state of the soil through NPK. Which are the organic substances that contain the essential nutrients to keep soil stable for crops.
