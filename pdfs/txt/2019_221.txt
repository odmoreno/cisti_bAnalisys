Technology as a didactic method of language teaching An approach to the impact, advantages and future
ABSTRACT
The current study has as its objective to analyse how the study of languages is affected by new technologies. The way of teaching as well as the learning process are not the same as in older times, so we think that it is important to analyse the phenomenon. There are several advantages to the use of technology, and the future heralds even greater evolution. The effect of technologies on teaching has been very significant and even university professors resort to the usage of websites or other technological tools. The concept of innovation is not only associated to information and communication technologies, but also to the process and innovative supply of methods of access to knowledge. Therefore, associating innovation to the teaching of languages is something completely acceptable, since the usage of technological resources is a form of innovating. Because the final objective is to find a coherent response that indicates what is currently happening in the world of education concerning languages, primary data was obtained via a total of eleven interviews answered by young language students and professors. With this study, we conclude that technologies will continue to have an impact on the future of teaching. There is a general consensus concerning the relevance of obtaining better academic results. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that learning becomes more facilitated with technology because there is easier access to information.
