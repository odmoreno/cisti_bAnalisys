Analysis of MQTT-SN and LWM2M communication protocols for precision agriculture IoT devices
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of the lifestyle of modern society and an important tool in many areas of business. In recent years, there has been a great need to connect new IoT devices to precision agriculture. Known as connected objects, it has been gaining more and more strength. As well as the adoption of IoT for agriculture, homes, smart cities, logistics, healthcare, manufacturing and others. There are also numerous concerns regarding the communication of these devices. With the ability to collect data, IoT technology becomes a valuable resource and care must be taken in the search for effective communication mechanisms. In this sense, this work aims to present an analysis between the MQTT-SN and LWM2M communication protocols, comparing their performance in the transmission of messages. The model was developed with the help of the Node-RED tool, which consists of flow-based programming in the evaluation and performance implemented at runtime. At the end of the simulations, it was possible to evaluate that the MQTTSN protocol presented better results in the tests performed.
