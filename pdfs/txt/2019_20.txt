Application of social network analysis (SNA) in a community of users of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
ABSTRACT
This work explores the use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) for knowledge extraction in a large user network of an integrated management system. In a thousand-user system like this, it is important to know how their relationship structure is formed and how to identify their most influential members. The cosine similarity technique was used to extract the connections between users and to form the study's target network. In order to analyze the network, the main measures in actor level centrality and network were evaluated. Both centrality measures and clusters were generated by scripts developed in Python and R using iGraph and SNA social networking tools. This work highlights the clusters identified with the Louvain algorithm that presented high modularity when executed with a user sample that presented greater strength of connection or similarity. The cluster analysis (communities) allowed to identify the most active and influential users and each of the groups pattern of use of the system. This information will be used for training and disseminating personalized knowledge among system users.
