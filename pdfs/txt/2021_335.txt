Methodological approaches for the study of the country brand: The case of Peru and perception in Germany
ABSTRACT
The country brand, in practical terms, can be understood as a branding technique applied to a territory or geographic region in order to achieve a competitive position on a global scale. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for the study of the country brand, analyzing its management and determining how it is being perceived among its target audiences. The proposal is based on a bibliographic review from which it is argued that there are multiple factors that influence the effectiveness of the brand message. It was mainly determined that both the management and the reception of this message require a detailed measurement in different phases. It is concluded that the reality of a country, reflected in international news coverage, means a communication flow that flows in parallel with the brand message and that requires special attention.
