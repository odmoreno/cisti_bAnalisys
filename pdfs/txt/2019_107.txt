Arcade platform in education: Analysis the impact of a preparation game for the ENEM
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the development process of a game that simulates the resolution of questions of the ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio), which makes possible, in an attractive way to students, another possibility of exercising their knowledge throughout their preparation for the exam. In order to achieve this objective, a qualitative research was developed, which demonstrates, in its results, the interest of students in using a platform like the one created in this project. In addition to the research with students, studies were made in the field of education technology, investigating the impacts of this approach in learning. The game, called FlipENEM, was developed to run on an arcade machine in a way that is visually more attractive than the similar platforms already existent, which are also studied in this project. For the production of the software and assembly of the arcade machine, specific tools such as NetBeans, Java and MySQL Server were used. After the initial tests of the arcade with students in a campus, it was possible to observe its positive impacts, as reported by students in a research carried out later on.
