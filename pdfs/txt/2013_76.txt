Stent strut detection in intravascular optical coherence tomography
ABSTRACT
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a catheter-based imaging method that employs near-infrared light to produce high-resolution cross-sectional intravascular images. In this work we propose a technique for stent strut detection in intravascular OCT images for the purpose of evaluation of neointimal coverage and stent malapposition.
