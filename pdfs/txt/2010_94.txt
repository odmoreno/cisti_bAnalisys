Integrating podcasts, vodcasts, screencasts and emerging casting technologies in the teaching/learning context higher education: Potentialities, practices and expectations of students and teachers
ABSTRACT
Over the past decade higher education has undergone significant changes marked by the Lisbon strategy of the European Union's Bologna process. Practices such as blended and e-Learning have been introduced as well as continuous initiatives and programmes. Given these changes higher learning institutions must try to adapt to their students' digital culture, which is conducive to new needs. This factor may indicate that new strategies and methodologies must be addressed and implemented in the classroom context, which must be adjusted to a new learning. The use of casting technologies has been found to be increasingly used associated with their apparent potential impact. Changes and innovations regarding the content of various subjects as well as respective activities are on the horizon. This need for change stems from the new technological environments/contexts within which the students are included. This work arises within the scope of the proposed creation of a research plan in Doctoral Programme in Multimedia in Education. The aim of this project is to assess the integration of podcasts, vodcasts, screencasts and emerging casting technologies in higher education learning environments and to assess both students' and teachers' opinions, practices and expectations. In this study we propose to create and integrate multimedia teaching contents, not only to support activities carried out in new learning environments whether face-to-face or distance learning, but also as a methodological strategy to adopt. The methodological choices will be mentioned throughout the article in conformity with the aim under study.
