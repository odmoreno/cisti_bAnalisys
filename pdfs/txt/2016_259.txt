Starting-up within digital social media: An experimental approach in a developing country
ABSTRACT
This descriptive research used digital social media to boost entrepreneurship and e-Business among university students of the last year of Business Management with observations from digital immigrant businesses and native digital businesses. From a total of 46 observations and its its CANVAS Business Model have been created a corporative website, a facebook account, a Twitter account, an instagram account, and 3 youtube videos; all accounts were linked among them and they only used search engine optimization. Digital immigrants, (existing physically businesses but without any digital visualization) had greater amount of online sales rather than digital native businesses (enterprises with no physical existence nor digital). Results are attributed to brand recognition, since previous trust was built already within the target market and therefore the greater amount of sales from digital immigrants businesses. However, it is highly recommended a study of consumer behavior related to the time it is needed to generate trust for native digital businesses to get recognition and generate a positive action about the brand.
