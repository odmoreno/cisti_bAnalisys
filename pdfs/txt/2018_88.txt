ABSTRACT
Transportation activity is essential for much of the economy, since most economic activities depend on the movement of goods and people. Currently Logistics has been hampered by changes in external and internal environments, such as: delivery time, tracking and fleet management, customer opinion, supplier dependency, economic crisis. Considering the problems reported, as well as new market trends, new business models and technologies, Stepbox was developed. A logistics application of goods deliveries that offers services through shared economy. One of the proposals of the Stepbox is to serve as a channel of communication between the transport service applicants and the companies that provide the transport service. In order to provide innovation in this area, Stepbox offers several value propositions for both the freight forwarder and the companies that provide this type of service. For example: shared economy, smart routes, cargo tracking, delivery value suggestion, check-in, qualification of the product collection and delivery process(gamification), geo opportunity. Finally, the evaluation of the Stepbox proposal was carried out, together with the companies and possible clients of the freight transport service. Based on the results, it was identified that there is a strong indication that the new business model proposed by Stepbox suits the reality of companies operating in the logistics sector and solves the problems described in this paper. This clue was also confirmed by the Startup competitions that Stepbox participated in around Brazil and Latin America.
