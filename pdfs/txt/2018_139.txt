GDPR in SMEs
ABSTRACT
This new reality is a challenge for any Organization, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have fewer human and financial resources to carry out the necessary measures to comply with legislation. In order to know how SMEs are preparing themselves we conducted face-to-face interviews with ten industrial SMEs. The main conclusion is that given these companies' lack of awareness of their obligations and duties in relation to Personal Data Protection, it is urgent to define a methodology to be able to comply with GDPR by 25 May 2018.
