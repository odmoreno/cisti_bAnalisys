Analysis of open source Business Intelligence suites
ABSTRACT
In recent time, technology applications in different fields, especially Business Intelligence (BI) have been developed rapidly and considered to be one of the most significant uses of information technology. BI is a broad category of applications and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access to data to help enterprise users make better business decisions. Whereas in the past the Business Intelligence market was strictly dominated by closed source and commercial tools, the last few years were characterized by the birth of open source solutions. This represents a tremendous competitive advantage, however the choice of a suitable open source BI suite is a challenge. The present study evaluated and compared the last versions of the five main Open Source Business Intelligence suites: JasperSoft, Palo, Pentaho, SpagoBI and Vanilla.
