Implementation of a multi-user laboratory based on Virtual Reality
ABSTRACT
This project arose from the need to have virtual spaces that allow the execution of experimental practices for students and teachers of the Communication career of the Open and Distance modality of the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), this process was carried out with different technologies that support virtual reality, one of them is Unity. The purpose of this article is to describe the main implementation processes of the TV set system (LabCam) and the acceptance by the users. The methodology applied in this project is the software reengineering, since there were previous versions of the TV set laboratory, so a reengineering was performed by collecting all the information of the current laboratory, the same that was necessary for the implementation of the new requirements to the multiuser system. The results obtained by 22 students of the Communication career through the standardized questionnaire of the usability scales system (SUS) was 70.5, which indicates an acceptable level.
