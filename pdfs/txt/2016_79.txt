Methods: an observational study was setup involving a sample of 30 participants. Results: the results suggest appropriate values for the reliability and validity of the new instrument; additionally, it was found that the results present a statistically significant correlation with the evaluation of the user performance. Conclusions: the present study indicates that the new instrument can be a useful tool for the usability evaluation of Ambient Assisted Living products or services.
