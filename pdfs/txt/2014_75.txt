Frequency assignment in multi-channel and multi-radio FiWi access networks
ABSTRACT
FiWi architectures have been proposed as cost effective solutions to provide high bandwidth and ubiquity at access network areas. In multi-radio and multi-channel scenarios an effective frequency assignment must be done to radios so that higher throughput and low delay can be obtained and the best of such architectures is achieved. Here we propose an approach for frequency assignment in multi-radio and multi-channel FiWi access networks. A simulation model is built to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our scheme is able to increase throughput and reduce delay, when compared with a fixed assignment strategy, by carefully planning frequency assignments which makes it possible to increase network parallel transmissions (reduce time division).
