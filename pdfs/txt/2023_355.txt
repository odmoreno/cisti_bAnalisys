SD-WAN Software defined networking using DMVPN for corporate enterprises
ABSTRACT
Corporate companies that have several offices in different locations need to be connected to each other and to the headquarters, to share traffic data, VoIP, databases, internet access, applications and others. Currently all these services are in the cloud and must always be available to users for the normal development of their activities, in a communication medium that is not secure as is the internet. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) solution using the DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN) protocol for the corporate segment. This study seeks to analyze the SDWAN solution for service providers for the corporate segment, using DMVPN, which allows the use of known protocols such as Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation (mGRE), IPsec encryption and Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP). This set of technologies is used to establish secure communications through dynamic tunnels in a Hub and Spoke topology, which is the type of network commonly used by corporate companies.
