Building the pillars for the definition of a data quality model to be applied to the artifacts used in the Planning Process of a Software Development Project
ABSTRACT
The success of a software development project is mainly dependent on the quality of the used artifacts along the project; this quality is reliant on the contents of the artifacts, as well as the level of quality of the data values corresponding to the metadata that describe the artifacts. In order to assess both kind of qualities, it should be therefore taken into account the artifacts' structure and metadata. This paper proposes a DQ model that can be used as a reference by project managers to assess and, if necessary, improve the quality of the data values corresponding to the metadata describing the artifacts used in the process of planning a software development project. For our research, we have identified the corresponding artifacts from those described as part of the Planning Process defined in international standard ISO / IEC 12207:2008. We have aligned these found artifacts with those proposed by PMBOK, in order to better depict their structure; and finally, we are to build our data quality model upon the DQ dimensions proposed by Strong, D. M., Y. W. Lee and Wang, R. in “Data Quality in Context.” Comm. of the ACM 1997 40 (5): 103-110. We all of these elements, we intend to optimize the performance of the software development process by improving the project management process.
