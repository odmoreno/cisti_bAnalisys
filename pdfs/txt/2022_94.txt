Analysis of Pandemic Data in Brazil : The relationship between vaccinated and hospitalized in Recife
ABSTRACT
This paper consist in a time series analysis of Covid-19 vaccination data and hospitalization data for suspected or confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome cases for Covid-19 among the citizens of Recife city, located in Pernambuco, in the northeast region of Brazil. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination to combat severe cases of Covid-19 in a population. For this, population vaccination data against Covid-19 and data on severe cases were arranged in time series for correlation study. The results show that the adherence in residents to the vaccination against Covid-19 can directly reflect a reduction of serious cases, even in front of challenges such as the relaxation of restrictive measures, the pandemic politicization, the high contagion of the variants, and the spread of misinformation about vaccines. The research also demonstrates that establishing a technological policy to combat pandemics may make a difference by generating consistent and reliable data for science in the race for answers, bringing speed and organization in the population immunization.
