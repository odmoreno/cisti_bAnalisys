Augmented Reality as a Didactic Tool for Development Spatial Intelligence
ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality (AR)complements perception and interaction with a semi-real world and allows the user to observe a virtual environment enhanced with additional information assisted by a computer. The use of this technology has been introduced in multiple areas especially in education for spatial intelligence development and students' learning improvement. This paper describes the development of a single didactic material representing Ecuador's historical content through an application of AR in order to improve teaching and learning processes. It shows historical facts on virtual models by superimposing 2D and 3D dynamic graphics which were generated in real time; and description of recognition marks design were utilized to create AR. Thus, it also presents level of acceptance and perception on students using this technology. Students' academic performance was analyzed before and after the didactic material was utilized in the classroom and results were recorded.
