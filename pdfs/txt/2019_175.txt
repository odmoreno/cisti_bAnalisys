Gamification in CPR - a Review of Game Dynamics and Mechanics
ABSTRACT
In sudden cardiac arrest, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with emphasis on chest compressions, is a fundamental step in the Chain of Survival. It is of most importance to have good technique to increase the success rate. According to some studies, CPR is less effective because people don't often train their skills. The objective of this work is to identify what game elements have been used to build serious games and gamification approaches for CPR training, and how this may influence the user's learning. From 3 repositories 307 articles were returned from the query, only 33 of these obeyed the inclusion criteria set for the study. The studies should be directed at the general population or health professionals; describes a system/method related to CPR or BLS training and using a gamified approach. Results show that, most of the games are digital; single player and don't use any external hardware. Regarding game elements, simple scoring is the most common feature. The main purpose of training CPR systems focuses more on knowledge acquisition and less on actual practice of CPR skill.
