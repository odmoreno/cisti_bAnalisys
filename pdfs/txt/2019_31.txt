Contribute for an Ontology for Smart Homes and their Conversational Assistants
ABSTRACT
Despite the improved capabilities of recent Assistants, control and access to the information regarding Smart Homes stills limited. More information is needed on what should be a Smart Home Assistant and how-to have the structured semantic information to support their answers and actions, i.e., how to structure the knowledge and make it simple to use by current approaches to Assistants, based commonly in intentions and entities. As contribute to increase Assistants capabilities in Smart Homes environments, based on analyses of the domain and user enquiries, we propose the basis for an ontology to support both, the interaction and the Smart Home knowledge base. The proposed ontology is being used to support the creation of an enhanced version of a Conversational Assistant for the Smart Green Homes project with novel functionalities, aligned with advanced user needs and expectations.
