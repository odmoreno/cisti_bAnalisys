Intraorganizational EDI system case study Sousacamp SGPS
ABSTRACT
Organizations are increasingly concerned with process optimization, thus aiming on gaining competitive advantages in the market. Inherent to any business, company or institution there is a constant document creation, manipulation and treatment flow. In many cases a real bureaucratic chaos. These processes involve great efforts in terms of human resources and are highly susceptible to errors. Sousacamp is a group of companies in the agrifood area that are geographically distributed throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Given that the group companies buy and sell from each other, the paper volume inherent to documenting these transactions is significantly high. This paper presents a documental integration strategy supported on the development of an application using ASP, .NET and C#.
