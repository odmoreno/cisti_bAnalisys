Learning analysis of mobile JavaScript frameworks
ABSTRACT
JavaScript is currently a popular language mainly in the creation of client-side code for both web development and, more and more, for the mobile applications development. In this paper, we analyze learning for programmers in frameworks for the development of mobile JavaScript applications, namely React Native, NativeScript and Ionic. This analysis was carried out based on a taxonomy adapted from Bloom, created in this work for the evaluation of programmers, with criteria initially selected for evaluation and with the application of questions based on the taxonomy in order to obtain the most relevant analysis criteria. The results show that NativeScript was the most difficult to learn framework with the most negative feedback, unlike Ionic and React Native, which presented identical global results, but with a slight upward trend in global mean results for React Native in relation to Ionic.
