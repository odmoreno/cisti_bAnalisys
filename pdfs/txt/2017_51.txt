A technique for evaluation and detection of potentially vulnerable code in Android applications
ABSTRACT
Searching for vulnerabilities in Android apps through approaches based on the app's dex bytecode has been applied to a lot of researches. This approach, called late detection, is applied to apps already released, and usually doesn't identify vulnerabilities before users have been exposed. This article presents a method based on static analysis with matching patterns for identifying these vulnerabilities beforehand, during the app development, avoiding users' exposure. The presented technique was evaluated by an experimental test proofapplied to open-source applications, analyzed by appDroidAnalyzer, identifying dozens of apps affected by vulnerabilities in their source code.
