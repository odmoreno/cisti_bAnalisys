Executive function assessment in Parkinson's disease patients using mobile devices
ABSTRACT
The objective of the project presented in this paper is to stimulate and evaluate the executive function in Parkinson's patients. This project is being developed in partnership with the Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre and the private social solidarity institution CASPAE. It aims to answer specific needs identified in the neurology service during the medical appointments. A common test to assess executive function is the Trail Making Test (TMT). This test is done on paper during the medical appointments for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with the executive function diminished, such as Parkinson's disease patients. The way the TMT is done poses some problems that led to the development of an application for smartphones and tablets, with Android OS. This application has two operating modes: “Appointment”, and “Train”. The “Appointment Mode” makes the realization, reading, and the organization of the tests results easier. The “Train Mode” allows that patients improve their executive function performing tests that are randomly generated on your own smartphone.
