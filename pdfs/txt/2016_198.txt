A firefly algorithm to solve the manufacturing cell design problem
ABSTRACT
This research focuses on modeling and solving the Manufacturing Cell Design Problem (MCDP) through a Firefly Algorithm (FA). The MCDP consists in creating an optimal design of production plants, through the creation of cells that group machines and parts. The goal of the problem is to minimize movements and exchange of material between the cells. The FA is a metaheuristic based on the mating behavior or flash of fireflies, in order to communicate with each other or attract potential prey. Fireflies move through the search space by means of attraction that they feel toward other fireflies until the stop criteria established is complied. Finally, to test the efficiency of FA, the results obtained have been compared with previous research illustrating encouraging results.
