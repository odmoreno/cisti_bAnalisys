Enhancing Technological Education: A Podcast for Teaching Oral Expression to Students
ABSTRACT
Until recently, audio content was seen as entertainment and only available through radio. However, the creation of audio has evolved with the expansion of the internet, from acetate discs to MP3s and digital creation platforms that offer editing processes. The podcast, which appeared in the 21st century, created opportunities for education. This study documents the use of podcasts as a tool for teaching oral expression to higher technological level students in Ecuador. The mixed methodology used direct observation of 25 students to show how this tool benefits their learning and skills development, particularly in presenting projects in podcast format. A survey was also conducted to determine the effectiveness of the teacherâ€™s use of podcast in teaching oral expression, and which skills were best developed. Results show that this tool is useful for teaching oral expression, improving learning, and enhancing student attention span, listening skills, and oral expression.
