Competency-Based Learning Object: Application of a methodology for its development and use in STEM careers
ABSTRACT
Currently, Engineering careers are immersed in a process of paradigm shift towards learning that adopts the Competency-based Approach. This presents a new challenge for the assertive development of materials as a complementary activity to the planning of the didactic sequence carried out by the teacher to propose a learning path that contemplates real or simulated activities typical of the future professional context.In this work, the authors develop a learning object (LO) for teaching Intelligent Agents in competency-based learning environments. To this end, they apply a methodology that makes it possible to identify the general and specific competencies associated with the LO. At the same time, the methodology takes into account both the technical and pedagogical perspectives of this process, promoting the development of a quality object. The object developed is intended to be included in an Open Access Institutional Repository (OAIR) so that it is available for different subjects corresponding to STEM careers (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).
