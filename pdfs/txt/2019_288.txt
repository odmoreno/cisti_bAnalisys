GIT and Augmented Reality as tools for promotion and development of spatial thinking
ABSTRACT
This research project, carried out within the PhD in Educational Sciences, specializing in Educational Technology, is intended to deepen knowledge regarding the contributions and potential of Geographic Information Technologies (GIT) and Augmented Reality (AR) as digital tools that improve the teaching/learning process and promote the spatial thinking development of students of basic education (BE) in different learning contexts. Supported by the qualitative method, the project is based on case studies to assess the respective perceptions, usability, relevance and attractiveness of GIT and AR, both by students and teachers. With this research project, it is hoped to recognize the motivational and pedagogical value of GIT and AR as research and analysis tools that develop more complex levels of spatial thinking, as well as it is speculated that teacher training is fundamental for the recognition of the potentialities of these technologies by teachers, and for increase frequency of their integration in educational practices.
