ABSTRACT
Having the information at our fingertips we can consider that we live in a digital age. In fact, images, sounds, videos and information in general are shared every minute all around the world by people connected to the Internet. We live with all the benefits, speed and efficiency that the Internet brings to us, but we must be aware of the inherent risks to data and equipment security. The future of the banking system is definitely dependent on the online services it can provide. Therefore, it is vital to know deeply all the types of cybercrimes that can affect this industry in order to defend those who use the banking online services. This research explores the theme computer security, specifically concerning the homebanking activity, so that (1) we can identify the risks involved in the use of this service and (2) understand if the users are aware of them.
