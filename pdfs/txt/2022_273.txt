The adaptation of brand communication on Facebook during the COVID-19 crisis
ABSTRACT
As a result of the pandemic, many brands were forced to adapt their communication. Among the messages disseminated are those of an emotional, reflective, optimistic and even entertaining nature. This behavior has been analyzed by some authors, calling this adaptation of brand discourse to the reality of an existing crisis as Advertcrisis. The objective of this study is to analyze how KFC, Cinemark and Samsung adapted their communication on Facebook during the COVID-19 crisis. It should be noted that these brands market internationally; however, the study of their communication was based on the social networks they manage in Peru. Therefore, the study is subject to a national market. To do so, a comparative review of the messages before and during the crisis was carried out through a qualitative research based on the case study. The results were contrasted with theoretical reflections, obtaining as a result that the three brands were immersed in the scenario described by the Advertcrisis theory.
