A channel-dependent algorithm for heart beats detection in ECG recordings
ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a computerized technique aimed at detecting heart beat positions in electrocardiograms (ECGs). The algorithm was implemented by adapting one of the most popular methods (Pan-Tompkins) developed to detect beat positions in ECG records, to be used in different leads of multi-channel ECGs. First, the Pan-Tompkins algorithm was programmed, and next, a lead-dependent version was implemented, adapting thesholds for each of the ECG channels. The original algorithm was tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, while the performance of the improved technique was tested on the different channels of records from the St. Petersburg Database. For the original Pan-Tompkins algorithm, a sensitivity of Se = 99.81% was obtained, with a positive predictivity (P+) = 99.85%. The F-Score was 0.9587, and the RMS RR Interval Error (RMSRRIE) resulted to be 4,480.46 ms. For the modified algorithm, results yielded an average value for Se = 99.92%, P+ = 99.98%, F-Score = 0.9718, and a mean value of 111.05 ms. for the RMSRRIE. Results indicate that our improved method provides similar better sensitivity and positive predictivity, increased F-Score, and it significantly reduces the temporal error when estimating the positions of QRS complexes (combination of Q, R and S waves representing ventricular depolarization in an ECG signal).
