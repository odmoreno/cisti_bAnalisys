Usability through Business Model
ABSTRACT
This is a proposal to identify usability specifications during the business process modeling using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Language Extended Lexicon (LEL). These specifications will be mapped to a structure called “Requirements Baseline” (Requirements Base Line), which describes the system's vocabulary using LEL, and scenaries to describe their behavior. Usability specifications will be introduced in stages using transformations, and specified as part of LEL's vocabulary. The use of LEL will allow to create a dictionary, which will contain all the usability specifications. The analyst will be able to integrate, evaluate, define and maintain the traceability of usability specifications in early stages during software process development.
