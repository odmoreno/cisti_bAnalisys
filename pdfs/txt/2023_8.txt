Interconnection of wireless sensors for IoT systems
ABSTRACT
When talking about biodiversity, Colombia is one of the richest countries, which has rivers and coasts on two seas; due to its position on the planet it has very rainy areas that produce large rivers throughout the territory, in addition to this, more than a quarter of the country is made up of wetlands, however, different parts of the country lack drinking water due to the lack of infrastructure and water quality control, which is responsible for the supply of this resource.The purpose of this article is to design a network model to interconnect wireless sensors that are in charge of monitoring the quality of water for human consumption, having an interconnection between the devices and installing a PLC, Raspberry pi or Arduino controller which will be in charge of all the data taken by the different sensors and will have a WAN (wide area network) connection, in order for the data to be transmitted to the internet, so that they can be processed and monitored in real time; a network will be collected automatically bearable in terms of powering the equipment, so sensors with solar panels and a network protocol to be defined for WSN (wireless sensor networks) are proposed.All this to have effective water quality monitoring, thus launching preventive alerts in case of having any type of water contamination, avoiding different problems such as deaths in children, illnesses or any effect caused by contaminated water.
