ICT Good Practices in alignment with Green IT
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies are so ingrained in our daily lives that it would be difficult to keep society functioning without them. One such example is the Public Administration, where the processes circulate electronically between the central, regional or local administration, allowing for greater speed, considering the ease of sending and receiving the documentation.This reality, combined with the pressure exerted by citizens or citizens in general on the administration, leads to the need for modernization and expansion of services, making them ubiquitous, allowing greater mobility, faster, reducing response times, and a consolidation of technological infrastructures.Therefore, these practices must be based on pillars such as sustainability, strengthening information security and improving environmental quality.The purpose of the paper is to present ICT best practices in line with Green IT, supported by international standards and frameworks, to optimize practices in organizations, namely in Local Administration.The main results of the approach are to actively contribute to the implementation of sustainability policies and alignment with Green IT good practices, in Local Administration.
