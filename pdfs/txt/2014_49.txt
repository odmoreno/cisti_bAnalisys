Social networks sites adoption at firm level: A literature review
ABSTRACT
The current technological and social Era in which our society lives, provides for the necessary background in order for Social Networks Sites (SNS) to be considered an essential and very relevant tool not only for individual social interaction, but also for firms to perform business activities. By analyzing the existent literature on the SNS adoption at firm level, the authors perceived the existence of a knowledge gap on this topic, thus creating the need for a SNS related literature review. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on the SNS topic, mainly focusing the efforts towards the adoption of this technology at firm level. Some final considerations on future research are also presented in the final section of the article.
