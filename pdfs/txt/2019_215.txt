Analysis of Timing Synchronization Techniques in FBMC for SDR Waveform: Performance Comparison
ABSTRACT
Software Defined Radio (SDR)is platform which provides various functionalities to implement different wireless communication algorithms and perform analysis on waveform in various propagation channels. Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC)is an efficient waveform which can provide low latency and higher data rates required for future communication systems. As in OFDM timing synchronization is needed in FBMC as it is also a multi-carriers waveform. Several algorithms are present in literature for burst detection in FBMC. Since SDR faces resources scarcity problem, the selection of appropriate algorithm which can provide desired detection performance with acceptable computational complexity is a major challenge. In this paper three algorithms including Minn's algorithm, Park's algorithm, and Leila's algorithm have been investigated based on their detection performance and computational complexity. The presented analysis is helpful for appropriate selection of burst detection algorithm for SDR wide band waveform based on FBMC.
