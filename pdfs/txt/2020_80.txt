IoT for cancer treatment: A mapping study
ABSTRACT
Internet of things (IoT) has applications in healthcare and medicine, where the treatment of cancer (disease with high incidence and mortality rates) stands out. The goal of this study is to characterize existing IoT platforms for cancer treatment, in terms of their purposes, types of sensors used, and cancer type treated. For that, a systematic literature mapping was performed, which included and analyzed 84 primary articles. We identified and classified 7 types of IoT platforms for cancer treatment, 39 purposes sought by those platforms, and 13 types of cancer. The results show that this is an active research area, where most studies focus on treating the types of cancer with highest incidence worldwide: breast, skin, and lung cancer, in order to reduce costs associated with the diagnosis and detection of the disease.
