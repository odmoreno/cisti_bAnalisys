Impacts and challenges of Digital Government for the Public Sectorâ€™s Human Resources
ABSTRACT
This article addresses the impacts of the new Digital Government paradigm in terms of Human Resources policies in the public sector and the challenges that, from this point of view, remain. In particular, the case of electronic provision of services in a District Center of the Portuguese Social Security was studied. In addition to resorting to theoretical foundations, the methodology used for the case study included the analysis of data from the application of two information collection instruments: the questionnaire and the interview. It was concluded that there were significant impacts in terms of work organization, change management and employee valuation. Important challenges remain related to the continuous improvement of applications and the development of human resources capacities and skills, namely in cross-cutting areas such as communication, information management and teamwork.
