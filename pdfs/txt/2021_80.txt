This is an exploratory research, with quantitative and qualitative approach, making use of structural equation modeling. The sample used was 115 participants who answered a validated questionnaire (Î± = 0.88), with questions about the e-learning system adopted by the institution. Thus, the variables that most influenced the Individual Impact and the Use of e-learning systems were User Perceived Satisfaction, which had the most impact variables on Computer Anxiety and Interaction with Others.
