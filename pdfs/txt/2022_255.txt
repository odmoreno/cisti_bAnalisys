Facial recognition proposal with the use of Python
ABSTRACT
We currently live in a society in continuous change and with a desire for technological development without limits, artificial intelligence is positioned as one of the areas that is having the greatest impact. Based on this environment of technological development, facial recognition is found, a tool that is increasingly used in any field or in any situation; from unlocking mobile devices, through hundreds of applications, to its use as a security measure.This project is based on the analysis, both at a theoretical and experimental level, of a facial recognition system from a database through and during the development, 4 key stages will be carried out. Presenting as the first part modern and updated technology that digital transformation can offer us. Second, a clear access control and its necessary requirements. Thirdly, select the appropriate tools that meet the anticipated requirements, such as the use of the Python programming language, and finally the implementation in various systems in which an adequate use of facial recognition can be presented, helping to improve a system of a company or organization. The use of Facial Recognition is currently used in various environments such as entertainment on platforms through filters for photos or videos on Tiktok, Facebook and more social networks, the security field has also been benefited using facial recognition in different entities to grant access only to authorized personnel and recognize criminals captured on video.
