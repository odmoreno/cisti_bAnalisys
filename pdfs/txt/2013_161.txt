Using mobile applications and online services to collect and compute statistics of peer assessments
ABSTRACT
We present an experience on the automated collection of peer assessments of collaborative tasks of students using online applications or services that allow you to configure forms and receive data electronically. For students to peer assess in real time we selected the Socrative tool that lets you use smartphones, tablets, or laptops in a conventional classroom, or desktop computers in a computer lab. For students to assess the teamwork made by each of the team members we used the Wufoo tool, which replicates several times the same form in the same document. The experience is very transferable to any subject in the curricula adapted to the EAHE in which you want to collect data provided by the students in an automated manner, especially evaluation surveys (about the teacher or other students or groups of students) and to get statistical information.
