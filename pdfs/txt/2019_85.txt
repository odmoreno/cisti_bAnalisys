Os Personal Learning Environments
ABSTRACT
This article aims to describe, in perspective, the initiatives identified in the literature related to the integration of LMS environments with external tools, usually called personal learning environments. Throughout the text are highlighted the difficulties of integrating these environments with other technologies, as well as the efforts to provide flexibility and ease in the accompaniment of learning activities between Learning Management System (LMS) and Personal Learning Environments (PLE). The description seeks, besides describing these perspectives, highlighting the challenges and possibilities that can direct other investigations in different educational settings to be viable alternatives to capture informal learning activities.
