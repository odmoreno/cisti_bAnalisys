Perception of information security in mobile applications
ABSTRACT
Information security and privacy issues are growing and increasingly serious, particularly in mobile applications, whose use has become widespread globally. Considering its importance, in the present study we analyze this problem from a theoretical and empirical perspective. We reviewed related research and conducted a survey to gain insights into mobile app users' perception of information security. The theoretical analysis shows a poor knowledge of users about the security of the information they share and a growing concern about the misuse that can be given to it. The empirical results revealed high levels of insecurity in users about the use that mobile applications can give to their information, at a general level as well as intergenerationally. It is the younger population generations, although in low percentages, that tend to trust and allow mobile applications greater access to their information with respect to adult populations.
