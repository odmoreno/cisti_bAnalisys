Adaptation of the PHIMA model to the evaluation of websites of courses of higher education programs
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to adapt the PHIMA model to the specificities of websites of higher education courses. Its adaptation to this area should make it possible to identify possible paths for a more complete use of the potential of the Internet. The PHIMA model intends to analyse the presence on the Internet of organizations based on five dimensions (depth, horizontality, interactivity, multimedia and accessibility). The central intention of this model is to determine how intensively the Internet capabilities are harnessed. This model intends to be a link between who performs presence on the Internet and the organization, in general and management, in particular.
