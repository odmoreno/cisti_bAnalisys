Healthy behavior with social apps: Proposal for evolution study of the use of fitness social apps on Facebook
ABSTRACT
The development of Social Applications (AS), that work with bio-sensors (GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, heart monitors, smart wristbands and smart watches) and which allow increased sharing of relevant information in social networks, is growing with the popularity of social networks combined to use AS mobile devices. Thus, it can define a User's Behavioral Pattern (PCU) with a particular focus of study. Therefore, this paper presents the work in progress of a doctoral dissertation that will study the time evolution of the use of AS in the publications of Facebook users' profiles. The case study is related to publications data mining of AS for physical activities (Fitness) to correlate healthy habits and physical activity, in order to predict the user healthy behavior and hence an improvement in their quality life. To do this, we are developing a data extraction tool throught an AS to Facebook, and its attractive point is the generation of competitive rankings customized by users and that can be published to your Facebook profile. Given the human competitive nature, it is expected a good spread of use of this AS, which will allow data mining to define the PCU healthy habits, where this PCU can be used to entice users to have a better quality of life and in this sense, decrease physical inactivity and risk for diseases associated with inactivity.
