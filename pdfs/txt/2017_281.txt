National cyber-security policies oriented to BYOD (bring your own device): Systematic review
ABSTRACT
There are some corporate policies in most of companies around the world, focus on mobile devices to be used as BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), but in Ecuador, these policies are not being established yet. In spite of that, this technology has been used frequently, even do some employers don't allow to use employees' mobile devices because of the inherent security risks, without being aware that BYOD carries a lot of advantages such as increase the company's economy, improve its communication skills and help to work at home, which now is a good alternative. Business policies should follow national policy guidelines as already happens in several countries, but in the case of Ecuador, such guidelines are not present in a formal way, the regulatory framework of this human activity that must come from the state has not been developed, not only to regulate the activity, but also to guide its use in a safe and proper manner providing privacy to users in all social and economic activities. This research begins focusing on a systematic review about BYOD's actual situation, its trend and impact, it will continue with the local situation and a proposal of recommendations oriented to have a National Policy in Ecuador.
