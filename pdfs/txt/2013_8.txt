Master Data Management and Data Warehouse: An architectural approach for improved decision-making
ABSTRACT
In corporate environments it is common to have multiple data sources that represent the same real world entity (such as customers, suppliers, products, etc.). This situation can also occur for external data (social networks, regulatory institutions). The extraction activity has the need to decide among the available sources, how best to obtain a given data. This paper presents an architectural approach to dealing with the problem of multiple data sources with the objective of improving the data quality of a Data Warehouse in conjunction with the presentation of a set of best practices to identify and implement the process of Master Data Management (MDM).
