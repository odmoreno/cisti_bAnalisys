A multicriteria model to support the definition of a software testing methodology for micro and small enterprises
ABSTRACT
Many of the micro and small-sized companies still do not have a formal testing process and do not even have the ability to implement a process that meets the needs and ensures the correct execution of activities. In addition, these companies have unique characteristics, in general, they develop smaller and less complex software, avoid expensive tools and complex procedures, because they do not have many financial resources. This paper presents the definition of a testing methodology possibly more viable for the reality of micro and small-sized companies. The testing methodology is based on the IEEE 829 Standard and was defined with the assistance of software testing experts, along with professionals working in micro and smalls-sized companies through an approach structured in multicriteria.
