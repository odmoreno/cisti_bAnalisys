The use of moodle in higher education evolution of teacher's practices over time
ABSTRACT
The way in which teachers perceive the Moodle platform, the importance they confer on it, the associations they make in relation to the changes that are going on in higher education after the Bologna Process, their needs and expectations, satisfaction, the attribution of meaningful relationships between the selection of resources and activities made available by the platform and the evolution of these practices over time, are some issues that we intend to explore in the study presented here. The fact that some researchers emphasize that higher education is subject to external and internal influence in integrating information and communication technologies through Learning Management Environments, as well as the conviction that the potential of the platforms is underused, has increased our interest in verifying what is happening in the educational institution in which we teach. The present article intends to present the study that is being developed by us, starting with the framework, explanation of the study object and objectives, the contributions we hope to give, the procedures, the methodology and the steps to be taken until the final conclusions are drawn.
