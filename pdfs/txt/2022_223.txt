Comparative Analysis of performance for SQL and NoSQL Databases
ABSTRACT
Databases are a fundamental part of the systems of organizations, companies or enterprises, therefore, the importance of a suitable selection of the database manager to use implies the correct functioning of the system and a factor of business success. This work is focused on measuring the performance between SQL and NoSQL databases by executing several tests defined in different scenarios, which differ in the number of clients and the number of transactions that will increase in each scenario and also the definition of benchmarks for hardware such as CPU usage, disk I / O, memory and software such as, response time, number of operations successfully executed; which will allow a comparative analysis between SQL and NoSQL databases or what is known as database benchmarking, obtaining a clearer view of the behavior and consumption of resources of each database manager.
