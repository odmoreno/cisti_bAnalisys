Universities in Era 5.0: the Future Accountant
ABSTRACT
Recently, research on the role of educational institutions in the Era 5.0 in finding solutions and contributing to the needs of students, organizations and society in general has sparked interest within communities and the nation, due to its power and character of innovation and transformation. Thus, and considering the new challenges posed to universities/higher education institutions by Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0, we intend with this paper to promote reflection on the role of Universities 5.0 in the accounting profession in the Era of Education 5.0.Given the recent discussion on the subject, this paper was developed based on a thematic literature review of the last decade, using the “Scopus” database from Elsevier and “Google Scholar”, to contribute to the discussion of the role of universities in the process of change, adaptation and transformation of professions, as well as in the preparation of the accountant in this digital era, the era of Education 5.0.We have found that the role of universities is crucial in the process of change, transformation and innovation of professions, organizations, and societies. Universities in the Era 5.0 must be at the forefront of the process of sustainable education and training to meet the needs of society. However, there is still a long way to go, and it demands speed in the teaching, pedagogical, organizational and social practices of these educational institutions. We will contribute to the reflection on the potential and implications of new technologies in the dissemination of Social Responsibility and sustainability practices.
