Flipped classroom and quizzes to motivate learning: Students perspectives
ABSTRACT
This paper describes a study about the application of the principles of flipped classroom in a freshman class in higher education, in the academic year of 2016-2017, reporting students' perceptions about this learning strategy. The approach was based on the students' preferences, indicated in an initial characterization questionnaire. Quizzes were the main resources for the self-evaluation of the knowledge acquired at home and the results helped the teacher to reorganize the lectures and the practical work, developed in pairs or in group. At the end of the semester the students (n=64) were inquired about their reactions and perceptions related to flipped classroom. The results gave evidence to students' acceptance of the approach used.
