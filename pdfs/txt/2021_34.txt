An easy-to-use tool to inject DoS and spoofing networking attacks
ABSTRACT
Computer network attacks are vast and negatively impact the infrastructure and its applicational services. From a cyber offensive and defensive perspective, there are a plethora of tools to craft and inject customized malicious packets in the network and exploit operating systems and application vulnerabilities. Those tools are however hard to operate by practitioners with less knowledge on networking fundamentals and students in the early stage of their studies. This paper proposes an easy-to-use application tool that can produce customized Denial of Service (DoS) and spoofing attacks. It was developed in Python and takes advantage of scapy library to process and inject network packets. A set of experiments was made, and the results obtained show the efficiency and accuracy of the attacks, by impairing the proper functioning of the victim's machines.
