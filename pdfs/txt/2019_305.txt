Allocation of shared resources
ABSTRACT
When it comes to shared environments, where processes distributed in process nodes access critical shared resources in the mode of distributed mutual exclusion, it is important to know how they are managed and the order in which the demand for resources by the processes is resolved. In this work, through an aggregation operator, a consensus mechanism is proposed to establish the order in which resources are allocated to groups of processes. Consensus is understood as the agreement that must be reached for the allocation of all the resources requested by each group of processes. To model this consensus, it is necessary to take into account that the processes may form groups of processes or be independent, the state of the nodes where each of them is located, the computational load, the number of processes, the process priorities, the use of the CPU, the use of the main memory, virtual memory, etc. These characteristics make it possible to evaluate the conditions for agreeing on the order in which resource allocations will be made, ordered by process group.
