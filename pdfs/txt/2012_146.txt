The teachers primarily responsible for the transmission of knowledge they enjoy from information and communication technologies as an essential tool in their school activities, providing new ways of teaching and learning. In this context, there was a reflection on the use of a technology resource - interactive quizzes as a new learning method in teaching practices. Taking into account that this method of learning involves teachers and students, as integral parts of the educational process, it was felt the need to provide the teacher knowledge in this area, in order to use them in their teaching.
