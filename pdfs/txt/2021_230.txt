The role of e-marketing as in specific contexts of sports tourism
ABSTRACT
Athletics is a sport that is going through several difficulties in Portugal, essentially at the financial level, since support and sponsorships are less and less, blocking the construction of financial sustainability, which is reflected in a reduction of medals won in international competitions. Thus, the application of sports and e-marketing to athletics becomes essential, as it will allow us to understand what consumers want, create attachment and paying attention to their preferences, habits and interests. The aim is to promote athletics in Portugal, to provide an increase in the number of sports tourists. The methodology based on the observation of competitions, conducting interviews applied to the study. From the results of this research, it is concluded that athletics disciplines do not meet an adequate e-marketing strategy, with low dissemination in the media. With a focus on some athletics clubs of Portugal and in the Athletics Federation of Portugal, this research aims to contribute to perspectives in the connection between e-marketing and sports tourism, applying specifically to a case study: athletics in Portugal.
