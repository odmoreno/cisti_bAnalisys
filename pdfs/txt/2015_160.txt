Enumeration strategies to solve constraint satisfaction problems: Performance evaluation
ABSTRACT
In constraint programming, efficiency in the resolution process can be affected by the order in which the variables of the problem and the domain values are selected. This activity is known as enumeration. At the beginning, it is difficult to determine the best choice variable-value pair that can generate potential solutions for constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper, we present an evaluation of different enumeration strategies, based on performance exhibited in a set indicators. These strategies solve different instances of constraint problems satisfactions. The results show that it is feasible to solve constraint satisfaction with at least one strategy enumeration.
