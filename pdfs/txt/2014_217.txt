Multimodal vs. unimodal biofeedback in videogames: An empirical player study using a First-Person Shooter
ABSTRACT
The graphical quality of modern videogames are the result of a steep evolution of hardware over the last two decades, but the game controls that are part of mainstream gaming did not change much in the same time period. To change this, biofeedback techniques using physiological sensors are being studied as possible replacements for traditional videogame interaction devices. In this paper, we continue on-going research by introducing unimodal and, for the first time, multimodal biofeedback game mechanics aiming at enhanced depth and expanded game design possibilities. We developed a First-Person Shooter to test these concepts against traditional unimodal mechanisms, and conducted an empirical study with 32 players. Both unimodal and multimodal variants provided high levels of fun to players, with subtle differences suggesting that these types are best leveraged depending on the interaction context on which they are applied.
