Problem-based learning methodology applied within a data network infrastructure design course a real case implementation
ABSTRACT
Education professionals are always searching for new ways of promoting learning, either by modifying the pedagogical project of courses or by the adoption of new learning strategies. In particular, this paper presents the results of an effort in order to bridge the knowledge acquired by students within classroom in face-to-face classes with technical skills required in real life situations. The contribution presented in this paper is the result of an assignment applied within an undergraduate Data Network Infrastructure Design course in a Brazilian university using an adapted Problem-Based Learning methodology (PBL), as a motivational tool. This paper also presents and discusses the resulting data related to the learning assessment.
