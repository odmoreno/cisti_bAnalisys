Open data analysis on teacning in Brazilian higher education: A case study of the Anísio Teixeira National Institute for study and research
ABSTRACT
The Brazilian government has set urged agencies and departments of the Federal Public Administration to share their data and information on the internet through the Public Transparency Page, to render its administration as transparent as possible using open data. Following federal government guidelines, the Anísio Teixeira National Institute for Study and Research (Institúto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisa - INEP), responsible for Brazilian higher education census, annually presents files with data on education on this page. Despite the enormous volume of data related to education on this portal, the lack of integration between the files presented and their original format, initially in ".SAS" format and "CSV" from 2013 census, hinder or impede their use as strategic resources for business analysis. This paper presents a prototype of the Decision Support System (DSS), organized in an On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) architecture, implemented from the data available by INEP, with the purpose of providing an appropriate environment for analytical queries of Brazilian higher education data.
