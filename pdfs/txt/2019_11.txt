Use preferences in Help Documentation
ABSTRACT
Despite the great advances in software usability, there are still recurrent doubts on how to operate an application. The aim of this paper is to evaluate use preference in learning a software, among 8 types of help documentation (manuals, online help, articles, FAQ, interactive online tutorials, tutorial videos, online forums and training) and three help alternatives (autonomous research, search engines, asking experienced users for help). The applied methodology had an exploratory character and used a questionnaire-based data collection technique. The respondents of the questionnaire were 104 students of the Software Engineering course of the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), Brazil. Among the results of the study, the recurrent use of each help medium, evaluated here individually, was highlighted. In this research, among the results found, it was evidenced that the respondents assigned high importance to help documentation, although they prioritized the use of alternative forms of help, such as different types of help documentation provided by third parties.
