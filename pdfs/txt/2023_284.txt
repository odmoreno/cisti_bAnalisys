Economic Complexity for Sustainability : From the linear economy to the Circular Economy
ABSTRACT
In a context in which environmental sustainability has been discussed as a need for global public policy, the forms of production have been put into debate. As one of the possible solutions to environmental problems, the circular economy highlights because it points towards the efficient use of the resources that are part of the value chain. In this sense, the objective of the article is to analyze the relationship between the Energy Transition Index and the Economic Complexity Index, considering that the energy transition can be categorized as one of the fundamental principles of the circular economy and, on the other hand, because economic complexity is a measure of knowledge that could enable the transition to cleaner energy. The results suggest that the most complex economies tend to venture into an environmentally friendly energy transition and, therefore, participate in the path of sustainability that the planet demands. The study is developed with the use of econometric techniques with data from a panel of 101 countries in the study period from 2012 to 2019.
