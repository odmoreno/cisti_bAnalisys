Performance Analysis of TCP-NACK Applied to a Real-Time Scenario
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the performance analysis of a new TCP algorithm designed for wireless networks on a realtime scenario compared to the generic TCP algorithm. Our work considers two network scenarios: indoor and outdoor with point-multipoint topology. The performance evaluation considers the throughput, jitter and delay metrics, to obtain these metrics the intrusive traffic injection technique was used using the D-ITG software, while for the qualitative analysis the Mean Opinion Score technique was used through a survey to establish a subjective measure of the quality perceived by the user based on the different network conditions. The results indicate that the new TCP algorithm presents a significant improvement of reduction by approximately 6% compared to jitter and delay metrics.
