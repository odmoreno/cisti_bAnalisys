Monitoring the allocation of European Structural and Investment Funds in Lisbon: a dashboard proposal
ABSTRACT
Portugal 2020 is a partnership program between Portugal and the European Commission that aims to support the strategy for the implementation of the five European Structural and Investment Funds in the country. With a total amount of 25 billion euros, the programs outlined define the programming principles that enshrine the economic, social and territorial development policy to promote, in Portugal, between 2014 and 2020. The following work reports and supports a detailed analysis of the Research and Innovation strategy for Portugal within the scope of the Lisbon Operational Program, in order to understand how funds from the European Union are being applied in this region specifically. Our study is based on the development of dashboards that streamline and simplify the process of observation and subsequent analysis of the most relevant information in this program. Its elaboration involves the use of Power BI, which supported the development of five dashboards. Once the dashboards are built, the information provided on them is an asset for decision making, especially in the Lisbon Region.
