DesignMe-MR: Toolbox for the creation of learning scenes to training in occupation risk prevention with mixed reality
ABSTRACT
Now, the Industry 4.0 has changed the way works the all process in industry and engineering. These changes affect in dramatic way in the training and learning worker's process. Either because the workers need to learn new technologies or skill, or because appear new technology that change the learning process in the very important way. The mixed reality applications like a tools int the worker's training process stay at risk because the actual tools to create mixed reality experiences are very complex and expensive. DesignMe-MR is a toolbox that aim to simplify the creation process of the mixed reality learning experiences to achieve decrease the cost to make the widespread implementation of mixed reality as a tool for operator training in any industry or engineering. DesignMe-MR use the mixed reality to help the mixed reality learning experiences creation process, making it a very useful tool for creators. The tests show a high level of user satisfaction in the application of mixed reality both in the content creation process and in the execution of the resulting training
