TEADETE : Device to bring Technology for All Equally Affordable
ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic that has been suffered worldwide in recent years, has highlighted the importance of technology in this world and has also led many people to be alone during confinement, unable to communicate easily with their loved ones due to their lack of technological capabilities or lack of available devices for it. In this work we present a first prototype of a device that aims to bring technology within the reach of everyone equally (TEADETE, in Spanish), with a simple and intuitive interface that allows people to communicate with their loved ones in an easy, simple and innovative way. In our study we have focused on the elderly people, with the aim of improving communication using technology and making it more accessible. To do this we have designed and implemented with 3D printing a smart device that allows communication autonomously by voice notes through the Telegram application, using for its implementation a Raspberry Pi, a screen, a microphone and a speaker.
