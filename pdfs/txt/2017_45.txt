Analysis of the evolution of institutional scientific collaborations of post-graduate teachers between the years of 2012 to 2015
ABSTRACT
The propagation and dissemination of knowledge are extremely important elements for the collaboration of the country's scientific growth and development. One example is scientific collaboration networks, where interactions between two or more researchers occur, making it easier to share and perform tasks for a mutual purpose. The objective of this work is to analyze how the institutional scientific collaborations occur through the collaborative networks of the Brazilian research institutions throughout the last four years, and also to identify how these networks have become denser with the intensity of collaborations of researchers linked to these institutions. As a result, there was the characterization of graphs, graphics and tabular results of the Lattes Platform data network. It is concluded that the number of publications among researchers of the same institution is still relatively high and that the evolution of institutional scientific collaborations is increasing.
