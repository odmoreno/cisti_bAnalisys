Intelligent tutor system model applied to basic electronics
ABSTRACT
Intelligent Tutor Systems (ITS) are programs that use artificial intelligence techniques to support students in their learning. These systems can be useful in different educational areas. Intelligent agent is an artificial intelligence technique that can be applied in ITS in order to support its users in the process of interaction with these systems.
