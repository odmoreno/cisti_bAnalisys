ABSTRACT
With the permanent development of technology, constant modernization and adaptation to new paradigms is imperative so that tourist experiences can maintain their competitiveness. Cultural tourism, one of the most competitive sectors of the tourist industry, has been adapting to global changes through the use of interactive technologies as a differentiating mechanism. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are two tools that enhance modernization and competitiveness, which are able to respond to the increasingly demanding needs of consumers. These technological innovations applied to a cultural experience manage to create a more immersive and interactive experience that attracts and satisfies the needs of tourists. This article aims to show the impact of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality on the cultural offer through the analysis of the 'Ara as it Was' experience, which is considered a good example of the application of technology in the recreation of past real events while enhancing interactive learning.
