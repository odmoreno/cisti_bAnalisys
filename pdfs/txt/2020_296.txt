Voice controlled interface oriented memory loss assistance system for older adults
ABSTRACT
Memory loss in the elderly is a situation of social relevance due to the ease and quality of life that this population has. The aim of this document is to develop a voice-controlled assistance system that helps older adults to remember important events in daily life such as taking a medication or going to a doctor's appointment. In this way, the system allows older adults to store important events that are mentioned during the day in any natural conversation, either by them or by the person who cares for them, in a Google calendar, so that later all the activities that the older person should do can be recorded. A study was carried out on 5 older adults together with their children or caregivers, in order to check how difficult, it is for this population to remember events and activities that are indicated to them in a natural way. The caregivers were asked to indicate 3 activities to be performed in the following week between Monday and Sunday and 3 medical indications with a period of time and hours in which the medicine should be ingested, and then asked if they could remember each activity after 30 minutes of listening to it. The results of the evaluation indicate that older adults tend to forget and the assistance system will make daily life easier.
