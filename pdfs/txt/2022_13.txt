League of Legends community's perception of influencer marketing from streamers on Twitch
ABSTRACT
This research analyzed the strategies used by eSports streamers to influence the League of Legend community when making a purchase or brand choice and what is the perception of viewers in this regard. With this work we sought to talk about influencer marketing, but through the user's perspective and in a sector of which there is not enough information, such as the eSports market. The objective of the research is to express, through semi-structured interviews, the perception of the viewers of the League of Legends community about influencer marketing used by eSports streamers on Twitch. Additionally, the specific objectives were to expose the community's opinion about the brands involved in eSports, to identify the users' reasons for following a streamer, and to identify the streamer's influence on the purchase decision of the members of the community. It was concluded that among the main reasons for watching streams are entertainment, identification with the streamer and learning about the game. It was also discovered that although brands have great value in themselves, influencers' recommendations enhance this value thanks to their high level of expertise, authority and trust.
