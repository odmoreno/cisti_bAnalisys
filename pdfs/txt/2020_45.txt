ICT Methodologies in Entrepreneurship: Business Models and Web Strategies
ABSTRACT
This work deepens in the active learning approaches oriented to entrepreneurship, through the results of a teaching innovation project developed in the context of the subject of Business Models and Web Strategies. To this end, various approaches have been applied that propose a strong orientation towards continuous assessment and practical learning, combining the intensive use of ICT and virtual classrooms in the teaching-learning process. The research presents innovative ways of applying methodological strategies such as educational portfolio, gamification, problem-based learning and research-based learning in an integrated manner. The results of the teaching project show an improvement in academic results and in terms of student satisfaction and the acquisition of skills such as the development of entrepreneurship, problem-solving capacity and the use of ICT.
