Emerging lines in the teaching of university communication the inclusion of data journalism in universities in Spain, Colombia and Ecuador
ABSTRACT
The Internet has transformed work dynamics and introduced new tasks, roles and types of content in the journalist's work. These transformations invite us to reflect on the skills and abilities that these communicators must acquire in order to be able to function with solvency in the work scenario. In this sense, communication faculties play a decisive role in achieving this task. Based on this, a comparative study is presented between four universities (Spain: Complutense of Madrid and Aut√≥noma of Barcelona; and Colombia: Sabana and Rosario, Ecuador: San Francisco University and Eqinoccia University) to find out what presence data journalism has in their respective curricula. In this way, the work analyzes the objectives, the type of subjects, the syllabus and the evaluation system, among other aspects, of the set of subjects of the curricular offer with the objective of identifying which themes and from which approach they work in each center.
