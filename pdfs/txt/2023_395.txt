The Disclosure of Environmental Indicators in the Portuguese Paper Industry and Society 5.0
ABSTRACT
The growing scrutiny on companies’ social and environmental performance implies the disclosure of information, not only in terms of legal requirements but also responds to the expectations and information needs of various stakeholders in society 5.0. This article identifies and analyzes the environmental indicators disclosed in the sustainability reports of companies in the Portuguese paper sector, between 2017 and 2019, and highlights its increasingly important role as we move towards a society 5.0. The results reveal an evolution in the disclosure of environmental information and the inclusion of information with the contribution of companies to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The main indicators disclosed relate to Energy and Emissions, Effluents, and Waste, which may be explained by the intense social scrutiny that companies in this sector have on these matters and by their awareness of responding to society’s needs for information.
