Symbolic Manipulation for Optimization of Boolean Functions for Control of Pneumatic and Electropneumatic Circuits
ABSTRACT
This article describes a program developed in PROLOG, which performs a symbolic computational manipulation of Karnaugh Maps (MK), to obtain the set of optimized logical equations that enable the control of pneumatic or electropneumatic circuits. The symbolic manipulation of a MK is governed by a set of generic rules that allow the minimization / optimization of logic equations for control of the circuit. This complexity comes from the combinatorial explosion that results from the increase in the number of cylinders that make up the cycle to be automated. The symbolic learning approaches were implemented by searching the MK symbolic patterns space. This search allows, with the use of rules, to reduce the universe of search in the space of symbolic patterns and to obtain the ideal solution to control the pneumatic or electro-pneumatic circuit desired.
