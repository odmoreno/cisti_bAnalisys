The role of digital technologies in a context with economic and educational needs: A study with African populations
ABSTRACT
This paper presents the current state of a study that appealed to digital technologies as a privileged means of training, in the language of schooling of African students' parents. The main objective of this study was to involve these parents in the school life of the students. The research methodology was an action-research model, using a variety of qualitative data collection and analysis techniques: research diary, biographical and process evaluation interviews, audio and photographic recordings, and content analysis using the Grounded Theory and the Atlas.ti program. The main conclusions of the development of the three cycles of action research were: (i) a better understanding of the school language from parents, that led to a greater capacity to follow the school life of their children; (ii) an improvement, albeit tenuous, in the use of some digital technologies, which led to a reduction in the info-exclusion of these parents; (iii) and the need to continue this project in order to fully achieve the objectives initially proposed, since psychological and social changes are slow. processes that require consolidation.
