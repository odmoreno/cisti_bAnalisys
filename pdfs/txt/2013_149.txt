Using ontological model to store resolutions of activity Theory contradictions
ABSTRACT
According to Engestr√∂m, contradictions must be envisaged as tensions or imbalances manifested by failures, problems or errors, and that can be detected by analysing the speech of the people in the organization, framed in the actions and operations carried out within a minimum unit of work - called activity - and described in activity Theory. Although there are several applications for operationalizing the resolution of contradictions, it appears that there is a lack of current methodologies that address how to manage the contradictions and how they can assist the transformation of organization. In this context, this proposal appears based on an analytical model for analysis of the contradictions in the implementation of an organization. The model provides the basis for the resolution of the contradictions in the ontological model. As a means of validating the proposal, its application was carried out in a case study of an organization that specializes in information security.
