Providing contextual information in smart cities with bluetooth beacons: a systematic review
ABSTRACT
Location-based services are becoming a vital part of people's daily lives, namely with the emergence of Smart Cities. In this context, it has become increasingly important to provide contextual information to deliver accurate services and meaningful results. Bluetooth Beacons are a widely adopted technology used for this endeavor. This paper addresses this subject by presenting a systematic review of the current applications of Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons to provide contextual information according to where a citizen is, and how this brings value to a personâ€™s life. The results are especially useful for understanding the current applications of these technologies and the value they add, particularly in comparison with existing alternative solutions.
