Epidemiological proactive surveillance based on Asterisk and Php
ABSTRACT
The new services of ICTs applied to the health sector in developing countries are opening new horizons in the field of epidemiological surveillance. Moreover, if these services are proactive they may be more effective in the prevention, facilitating the work of primary care units and optimizing the policies of the agencies responsible for public health. Our research group in collaboration with the Research Institute of Health Sciences (IICS) from Paraguay, is developing a surveillance system for febrile syndromes based on a VoIP Asterisk PBX software and its interaction with databases and forms via web scripting language php.
