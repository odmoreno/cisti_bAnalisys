Diagnostic on teaching-learning of software desing by using the Personal Software Process framework
ABSTRACT
The high quality software development is one of the objectives of the Software Engineering. For achieving such an objective, the engineering professionals should use methods, methodologies, and tools to improve the performance and quality during the development software process. The professionals are using the Personal Software Process (PSP) for organizing, planning, and tracking their work, to achieve self-improving in the performance. The design phase is included in the PSP structure because of the personal work verification from the design phase is considered a key process. In this work a study of PSP teaching and learning focused on the design phase definition is developed. The objective of this study is establish a diagnostic of teaching and learning for identifying the receptivity level from the students and the teaching aspects improvement from the tutors. Such diagnostic is based on the interview and survey as exploratory methods, which resulted in qualitative information associated to students profile, tutors difficulties, and weaknesses from PSP for establishing teaching aspects improvement.
