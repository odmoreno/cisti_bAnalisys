Intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things: A literature review
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new model that integrates physical objects and Internet and became one of the principal technological evolutions of computing. It is estimated that a trillion of physical objects will be connected to the Internet until 2022. The low accessibility and the lack of interoperability of many of these devices in a vast heterogenous landscape will make it very hard to design specific security measures and apply specific security mechanism. Moreover, IoT networks still exposed and vulnerable to attacks aimed to disrupt the network. Therefore, additional security tools specific to IoT are needed. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) could fulfill this purpose. In this paper, we present a literature review on the IDS in IoT topic, mainly focusing on the current state of research by examining the literature, identifying current trends and presenting open issues and future directions.
