Evolution, applicability, new challenges and opportunities in Telemedicine
ABSTRACT
Telemedicine is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a tool to improve access and quality in healthcare. Its benefits are undeniable: breaking physical, geographical and temporal barriers between health services and its users. The improvement of the ICT had revolutionized the acting and the strategic planning of healthcare organizations, especially on that effectiveness, efficiency and quality. Despite the obvious advantages in its implementation, Telemedicine still far from constituting a daily practice in our country. There are successful experiences in their use, such as Coimbra and Alentejo, but it is clear that its potential is not being harnessed, especially when we compare our country with other European geographical spaces. With this work we intended to understand the evolution of Telemedicine, the advantages and inhibitors to its improvement, and know the actual Portuguese situation as well the future prospects in this area.
