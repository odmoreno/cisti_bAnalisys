Two humanoid simulators: Comparison and synthesis
ABSTRACT
In this paper an overview of two humanoid simulation platforms is provided: Simspark, a 3D Robocup simulator and the robotics simulator SimTwo. Although these two simulators have different background, today they share the same humanoid robot model, namely the Albaderan NAO robot. According to the fact that developing reliable and robust biped locomotion and low level humanoid behaviors are still challenging tasks, simulation has an important role in improving humanoids movement development approaches. In this paper the two humanoid robotic simulators will be compared in face of simulating Humanoid low level behaviors. The comparison is based on identifying the same role and locomotion approaches. The results show that Simspark is closer to reality than SimTwo.
