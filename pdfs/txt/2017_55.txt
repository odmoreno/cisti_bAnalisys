Designing learning paths: Contributions to the organization of b-learning initiatives
ABSTRACT
This article presents a simple guide that supports the pedagogical planning process. Besides the knowledge that will be shared, structuring an learning unit or a course demands reflection and effort in the teaching/learning development. The work described in this paper proposes a guide that speeds the process of defining online learning strategies by crossing cognitive objectives, pedagogical models, techniques and free web tools. The usefulness of the results obtained can be viewed on the perspectives of both student and teacher, thus it is a mediation instrument among all the players in the learning process. At the same time, it helps the bureaucratic procedures that are usually associated. We conclude this paper by presenting a set of recommendations obtained by the application of the pedagogic planning suggested in an implementation of an online course.
