Digital competences at university level: analysis from personal learning environments
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research is to analyze digital competencies in a group of university communication students, through the use of personal learning environments (PLEs). It is based on theories of connectivism and constructivism, with a constructivist paradigmatic vision, a mixed approach, a nonexperimental design and a descriptive scope. Participants were 562 university students enrolled in the School of Communications of a private university in Lima, Peru. PLEs were measured with the Competencies for Lifelong Learning based on the use of PLEs (CAPPLE), while qualitatively they were analyzed through interviews. Among the findings, it was found that 52.2% of the female students mostly use PLEs. Though 90% of students prefer to use virtual environments, only 32.2% usually interact with teachers. In terms of students' digital competencies, the ability to solve problems related to the use of technology, identification of inappropriate behaviors and digital protection, as well as the recognition of limitations in the complex handling of technology stand out. According to the findings, it is considered necessary to implement programs and tutorials related to virtual learning spaces for teachers.
