Conceptual modeling of learning paths based on portfolios: Strategies for selecting educational resources
ABSTRACT
In this days, learning in the classroom is moving at a much slower pace than technologies. Thus, the use of ICTs in education allowed the classrooms to expand and transcend the limits of space and time, a situation that although it has enormous advantages, it is necessary to provide pedagogical characteristics that make them more user-friendly both as a teacher and as a student. The need of professor as a guide, planner, mentor and evaluator in the learning process is indisputable, that is technological developments should support these tasks taking into account didactic aspects and not only technical ones. One of the challenges that emerge is the need to personalize learning according to the student's abilities and the characteristics of the object that is learned. This paper present a conceptual model of an intelligent system that uses the concept of learning paths based on portfolios. For this, the system takes into account both the different levels of assimilation of knowledge that a student can achieve as indicators of learning that give professor the guide of the progress in the learning process. In this way, a learning route is proposed that seeks to achieve the highest levels of learning possible for a particular student through the use of study materials adapted to each situation.
