The Potential of Digital in the Hotel Sector
ABSTRACT
Digital channels are currently very relevant tools in organizational communication in the areas of business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C) and consumer to consumer (C2C), and should therefore not be neglected [1]. Tourism in general, and hospitality, due to its intrinsic characteristics, has been particularly influenced by this trend. In this sense, the objective of the present investigation is to understand the influence that generic and non-generic channels have on the hotel sector, both from the perspective of the entity and the consumer. To this end, data were collected on several digital channels from twelve hotels located in the city of Porto, with different star ratings. In this context, in view of the results obtained, it was clear that the content and presence vary according to the classification, being important to determine the target and the positioning that is to be reached before defining any communication strategy.
