Amuse capitalism. The leisure capitalism? A theoretical approach
ABSTRACT
Several theorists and researchers consider that today we live in an era called “late capitalism”, other theorists call it the “world-culture” where the means of production and the capitalism of information have been left behind. This new capitalism, expressed in advanced and developing economies, focused on the Internet and the media as a means of reproduction and capital accumulation. Without a doubt, the content of the media that reflects the global culture on the Internet has changed consumer behavior. A principle that controls this scenario is the homogenization of the consumer. It has become evident that the creators of culture of the countries of the northern hemisphere have identified the criteria of globalism to expand communication, culture and the content of the media. On the other hand, we oppose coining the term capitalism of information, when the following data show that the use of the internet focuses on the use of technological platforms, for recreational and leisure purposes. The following article, search can give an idea of cultural capitalism and how the concepts of cultural industry, are still valid.
