ABSTRACT
In the case of Ecuador, the tourism sector is seen as a key element for the economic and social development of the country. In this context, the research presented has as its scope of study the Zapotillo Canton of the province of Loja (Ecuador), specifically the parishes of Mangahurco, Cazaderos and Bolaspamba, a region in the south of the country that has important economically and socially depressed areas, but has enough tourist attractions to captivate tourists and visitors. The main objective of the research is to know, on the part of the actors involved in the management and tourist planning of the areas of study, their opinion in relation to: the tourist development presented by the parishes; their role as key agents in the development of the zones and; their involvement in the application of environmental policies. The methodology is based on the use of secondary and primary sources, through the development in the latter case of qualitative research based on in-depth interviews. The results show that Mangahurco, Cazaderos and Bolaspamba have great potential to bet on the development of a model of rural community tourism, however there is still a long way to go, so it is recommended to work on socially responsible proposals and in the promotion of plans, which seek social inclusion, sustainability and conservation of nature and culture in the three parishes studied.
