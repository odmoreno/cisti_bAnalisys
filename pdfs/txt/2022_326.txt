Digital Evolution: blockchain field research
ABSTRACT
Blockchain is a relatively new technology supported by a decentralized database that received special attention at the research level in the last years due to its fundamental characteristics. Numerous researchers have applied blockchain studies in many fields, but the scope is very large and there is no delimitation of new and emergent trends. The method used to better understand the evolution and impact of blockchain technology was a bibliometric analysis. A search was conducted at digital Elsevierâ€™s database with a single keyword blockchain, and 23383 articles were collected. The study uses cluster analysis method, allowing to construct and visualize bibliometric networks and to build co-occurrences networks. The results indicate that there are positive correlations between countries, that China and the United States are part of the most influential cluster. Indicates also emerging developments in the areas of governance, industry, decision-making processes, management, internet of things, information security, and a new hot topic, energy.
