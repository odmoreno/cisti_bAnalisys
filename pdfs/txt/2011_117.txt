EVA: Collaborative Virtual Learning Environment based on digital pens
ABSTRACT
Although day by day Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly important, the physical paper is widely used, especially in education. The majority of the technologies that are being implemented in education are ignoring this fact, digitizing every content and communication activities without considering the preferences of students. This article proposes a framework that integrates the use of physical paper with virtual learning environments to allow the creation and sharing of documents and conducting collaborative activities not only in class, but also remotely. It aims to demonstrate that the connection between the digital world and physical paper will contribute to the improvement of the productivity of students.
