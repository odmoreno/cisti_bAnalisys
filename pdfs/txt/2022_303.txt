Why should teachers integrate ICT into the teaching and learning process? : Pre-service teachers perspectives
ABSTRACT
The inclusion of ICT in teaching and educational processes has become an irreversible fact. The degree of use of computers, Internet and software depends on many macro- and micro-social factors. Among the key factors related to the effective use of ICT in schools, the attitude to new media among educators, parents, students and management should be singled out. A group that requires special consideration is also the new teaching staff - students of teacher education courses. This is the future generation of teachers, the vast majority of whom grew up in the phase of intensive development of the information society. This text is an attempt to answer what attitudes to the use of ICT in education do the students of pedagogy have? Based on the analysis of qualitative data (students' statements) conducted in Poland in January 2022, it was noted that: 1) The use of ICTs at the current stage of development of the information society is a natural necessity; 2) The use of ICTs is something obvious for pupils and students also in the area of learning; 3) Teachers should use ICTs due to the increase of motivation and involvement; 4) ICTs have become a complement to analogue teaching means; 5) New media bring new opportunities in teaching and educational activities; 6) Teachers who use ICT regularly and effectively are considered more modern than those who use only analogue means of teaching; 7) ICT (e-learning) has become a necessity in modern schools, which was especially noticed during the COVID pandemic.
