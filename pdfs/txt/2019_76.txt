The performance of QoS in wireless sensor networks
ABSTRACT
This research paper provides a brief description of the wireless sensor network and the protocol to be used. Through this technology, benefits are obtained that provide the sensor networks together with greater freedom when placing the sensors in the vicinity of the target. In wireless sensor networks, routing is a critical and important aspect. The work focuses on the performance of the quality of services in the wireless sensor network (WSN) under the AODV routing protocol. This document tries to characterize the AODV protocol by performing simulations in the NS3 (Network Simulator Version 3) program. In the simulations of the AODV protocol, a set of metrics that can be used for comparisons in different scenarios are shown. The main objective of this document will be to offer a suitable simulation environment to determine the operation of the protocol to be used in wireless sensor networks.
