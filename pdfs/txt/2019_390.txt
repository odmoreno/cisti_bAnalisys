Electoral Television Debate and Infotainment: Elections to the Spanish Parliament
ABSTRACT
Political communication has evolved to new practices that, in the field of television, involve going beyond the borders of purely informative formats and working with the presence of candidates and institutional managers in entertainment programs, the so-called infoentertainment spaces, present in practically the programming of all generalist chains. In this context, the electoral debates also evolve in form and content, abandoning the rigid classical format and moving towards a type of program with a greater weight of entertainment, more purely television. This paper analyzes the presence on television of the candidates of the main political parties in the General Cortes Elections held in Spain on December 20, 2015. For this is taken as a sample the intervention of all of them in the Mediaset (Telecinco) morning magazine El Programa de Ana Rosa.
