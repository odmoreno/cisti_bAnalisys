The information and communication technologies in tourism degree courses â€” The Portuguese evolution
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies appear one of the most critical areas to the success of tourism in the future and the way it will promote the tourist destinations. This paper aims to analyze the relevance given by the various Portuguese institutions of higher education to Information and Communication Technologies in their degrees. The analysis carried out was done in degree courses operating in this academic year, 2017/2018, in Portuguese universities and polytechnics, public and private. A comparison was also made with the reality of 2012/2013, since as undergraduate degrees have been evaluated by the Agency for Assessment and Accreditation of Higher Education (A3ES), often making changes, resulting from the evaluation.
