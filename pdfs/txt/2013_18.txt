Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Vox4all® presentation
ABSTRACT
The increasing dissemination and wider access to mobile devices, as well as the spread of applications in several areas requires us to rethink the technologies for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). There are now over a hundred applications for AAC available on the market, at a considerably lower cost when compared to traditional communications systems. In this paper we present a benchmarking study of the most relevant and the results of an inquiry. Both lead us on the design and specification of the new app Vox4all® that will be iteratively refined and tuned to meet the end users needs using a case study methodology. Facing the challenges of a new era for AAC technology, we are combining theory and practice on the development process of a specific application.
