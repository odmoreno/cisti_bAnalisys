Data Quality in health records: A literature review
ABSTRACT
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are data repositories that contain medical and treatment history of patients. Data collected in EHR and EMR may present Data Quality (DQ) issues, which compromise their use to research due to the validity and the reproducibility of the results. The present paper is a Literature Review (LR) that summarizes how DQ of healthcare data has been addressed and which methodologies were proposed. Initially 698 papers were identified, searching in five databases with two search strings. After three paper-filtering stages, 44 papers remained for full quality assessment and results extraction. The findings show that many DQ dimensions have been used for assessment, but there is no consensus in the definitions of the dimensions. For DQ improvement, the activities performed were categorized into two groups, one related with Data Governance and the other related to Data Cleaning.
