Smart Governance Models and Solutions
ABSTRACT
The great challenge of the governmental area in smart cities is the management of various technological resources to serve the citizens. It requires a framework that can control and monitor data and information to reconcile technology with the population's needs in a specific territorial, economic, and social context. This paper discusses some proposed Smart Governance solutions for Smart Cities concerning their applicability and benefits achieved. To conduct this study, we worked on a literature review on this topic in scientific article repositories. The studies conclude that although technology collaborates with Smart governance, the participation of all sciences is necessary for elaborating strategies that contemplate local complexity.
