Technical analysis and approaches for game development in Second Life
ABSTRACT
The development platform of a digital game is frequently defined before any game design document. Without a proper examination, this could exclude other viable solutions. Although the online virtual world Second Life is sometimes erroneously denominated a game, it can be used as a development platform for many purposes. This paper analyses game creation within the Second Life virtual world and possible approaches for the implementation of game assets and game logic. There is also an analysis of what game types could be more suited for development under this platform. Experiences learned from the developed prototype are shown and hints are given as to evaluate different techniques and expose best practices.
