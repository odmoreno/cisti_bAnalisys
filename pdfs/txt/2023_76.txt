We Help : Platform to find service providers
ABSTRACT
These days, finding a service or service provider that suit a user’s specific needs may not be a simple task. To assist in this task, several software applications have emerged. This article presents the We Help platform, which consists in a web and mobile application, and has the goal of helping service providers promote their work, and evolve with their business, as well as facilitate and help its potential users to find the right service(s) for their specific need. The platform allows service providers to advertise their services and allows potential users to filter the results so that the information is presented in an appropriate way considering their specific needs. We Help also provides a ChatBot to support the use of the platform by its users. We Help was developed using OutSystems’ low-code development platform and to implement the ChatBot was used an OutSystems component that uses Azure resources. Unit tests were conducted to the various features implemented, after the prior definition of acceptance criteria for each of them. The We Help application was made available to a set of potential users to perform acceptance tests and the initial results indicate that the application was globally well accepted by the respondents.
