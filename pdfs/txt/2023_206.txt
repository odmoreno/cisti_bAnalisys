OntoTurnover: : A Lightweight Domain Ontology for Modeling Employee Turnover
ABSTRACT
With over 100 years of published studies, turnover is the most studied topic in People Management due to the damage it causes in companies. Even with a very consolidated bibliographic base, it is not possible to find studies that support this theme through the explicit and unified representation of the concepts. In this sense, this study aims to create a domain ontology, a concept borrowed from Philosophy by Software Engineering to enable the definition and rationalization of domains by computers. To this end, a systematic review was carried out to support the methontology, a set of pillars that provide the basis for the ontology. This, in turn, was represented formally and graphically through Protégé. OntoTurnover was built, an ontology that supports the explicitness of the theme and enables the creation of systems that act to solve the turnover challenge. This study allowed us to build a domain ontology about turnover through the extensive literature present on the subject, thus favoring advances in the practical contributions of Software Engineering to the theme. Future studies should be conducted to axiomatize the model and allow the performance of inference tasks for decisionmaking.
