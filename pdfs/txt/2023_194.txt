The effect of technological progress, sustainability and human development on environmental degradation in Latin America: Period 1990-2020
ABSTRACT
The effects of technological progress on carbon emissions and, therefore, on environmental degradation represent a fundamental factor for the planning and creation of technological alternatives that make it possible to achieve a technological advance that is linked to the preservation of the environment. Likewise, the effects of the populationâ€™s quality of life and the sustainability of a country on said degradation, are a necessary part of the environmental research field. This study focuses on the analysis of these three indicators on carbon emissions into the atmosphere using data from a block of Latin American countries for the period 1990-2020. An econometric estimation of fixed and robust effects was used to estimate the mathematical effects of such variables. The study yields a direct relationship in the case of the indicator variables of technological progress and quality of life, while in the case of the proxy variable of sustainability it yields an inverse relationship. The results are framed in this Latin American socioeconomic scenario and therefore differ with studies previously carried out in developed countries.
