Knowledge description model for bodies of knowledge in software engineering context
ABSTRACT
Bodies of Knowledge (BOK) contains the relevant knowledge for a discipline. BOK must embody the consensus reached by the community for which this BOK will be of application. This consensus is a prerequisite for the adoption of the BOK by the community. In this paper, we utilize a combinations of Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), models representation, and design science methodology in order to describe the software engineering knowledge context (SEC). SWEBOK serves as backbone taxonomy, while models representation provides a context of representation. In the process of develop of this paper science design methodology was used to provide fundamental knowledge in software engineering (SE).
