Project management and IT governance. Integrating PRINCE2 and ISO 38500
ABSTRACT
IT governance is becoming a critical area for the improvement and business continuity in organizations. The value of the services, as a product of IT projects, must be improved. A good definition of IT projects, according to business needs, helps to improve product value. For this purpose, some frameworks and standards have been developed by internationally recognized institutions. Among them project management framework “PRINCE2” and the IT governance standard ISO/IEC 38500 are highlighted. The application of these frameworks and standards has meant figures have improved, but they are far from covering the expectations of organizations. A IT project approach that integrates the needs of business and technology that supports it is a key to achieve the expected success for IT projects in organizations. This paper presents a summary of the study performed to find out how PRINCE2 meets the expectations of IT governance according to ISO/IEC 38500. The study could help knowing and improving and expectations of success in PRINCE 2 projects.
