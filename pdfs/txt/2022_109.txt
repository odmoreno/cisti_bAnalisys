OARA Methodology for designing of Learning Objects with Augmented Reality, University Experience
ABSTRACT
The pandemic has transformed higher education around the world, requiring resources that are increasingly accessible to the entire educational community in an easy, free, interactive and motivating way.This research analyzes an academic experimentation with university students of the Computer Teaching Career as content designers and students of the first semesters of the Faculty of Human Sciences and Education of the Technical University of Ambato, as consumers of information, in this context we sought to identify the advantages of using a methodology of design of Learning Objects with Augmented Reality (OARA), for the construction and editing of all the content until its publication, after the implementation, the TAM Model was applied to analyze the level of technological acceptance of the resource used.Statistical data show that the use of learning objects with AR has awakened a high degree of acceptance and motivation for the use of the resource, as well as the ease of access through mobile devices, usefulness and relevance has allowed an improvement in academic learning.
