Projecting school enrolments through an integral flow model
ABSTRACT
Projecting school enrolment is an important labor for educational planners. This activity allows them to build educational policy and strategic planning. Nowadays, it is reported several work for supporting projections in the educational system. However, in the context of general enrolment projection, there is a clear need for a well-founded flow model for supporting enrolment projection in multiple scenarios, with possibility of analyze the effect of different educational variables in different educational levels. The purpose of the current work is to develop such a model for projecting school enrolment. We set out to highlight why our flow model is a truly integral approach for projecting school enrolment. The empirical evaluation shows that our flow model can be a useful tool for supporting educational planners in the decision making process.
