Analysis of environmental sustainability educational approaches in engineering education
ABSTRACT
The knowledge society as our historical era is declared many times, needs constant transformations and be at the forefront of current and future challenges. Pollution, the opprobrium suffered by nature, the wear of natural resources among others, are the great challenges we must face in the 21st century, engineering has always played an important role in solving the problems that humanity has historically faced, but apparently it is not doing the pace demanded by the environment or engineers do not have the skills or abilities to solve them. This research is attached to the PhD in Training in the Knowledge Society of the University of Salamanca, Spain and intends to study the reasons from the base; that is, from the training of engineers in universities, respond to; Are engineering faculties providing updated knowledge and tools so that they can help mitigate or remedy environmental difficulties? For this purpose, the existence of two validated proposals in education on environmental issues, Education for Sustainable Development (EDS) and Environmental Education (EA) will be taken as a guide, once analyzed the integration of any of these two currents will be reviewed. engineering curricula and strategies will be proposed to involve them in the corresponding cases.
