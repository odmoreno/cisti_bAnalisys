ABSTRACT
The evolution of information technologies and the accelerated growth of mobile devices have changed the world we live in and the educational field is no exception. Every day we see more and more frequently the incorporation of mobile applications to the teaching-learning process by teachers in their classroom; with respect to children, the use of applications in mobile technology was revolutionary, opening a new horizon for them. Considering the aforementioned, we present a fragment of the results of a descriptive, quantitative research that was conducted in the city of Tijuana, B. C., Mexico, to evaluate 3 mobile applications in private primary schools where teachers incorporate information technologies in their teaching process.
