Aplicación Móvil para un Aparcamiento Inteligente~ A Mobile Application for a Smart Car
ABSTRACT
In the present, the design and implementation of a smart parking prototype is carried out, which allows us to calculate the number of spaces available or occupied in a car park. The data of each of the car parks shared in real time through a mobile application for smartphones and an interactive and intuitive web platform for easy access and use of it. The development of the project starts with the research, the necessary resources, the function of a processing base, a microcontroller, which is responsible for carrying out the control, the operation of the system; and the sensors that detect the physical state of the vehicle parking space, which will be transmitted to a WiFi module and once to the application.
