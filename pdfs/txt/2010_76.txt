i-om: Intelligent optimization: For computer graphics and visualization
ABSTRACT
There are several problems in the computer graphics and visualization domains which require optimization tasks to be performed in order to improve the quality of the overall process. In this context, we propose and describe an innovative optimization methodology and a supporting software framework: i-om. The design goals of the proposed framework were twofold. The first comprises the decoupling, as much as possible, of the optimization process from the application specific processing tasks. In order to attain this goal, we opted to make use of intelligent techniques (i.e. metaheuristics). The second goal is to allow remote operation, and consequently great portability and interoperability, between the optimization tools and the visualization application. To fulfill the latter requirement the proposed framework was designed with the ability to communicate with external application using a specifically developed high level message protocol. The optimization framework was implemented and the paper presents illustrative results demonstrating the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
