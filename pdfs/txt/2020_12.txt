A context aware application to support the execution of daily tasks of people with cognitive disabilities
ABSTRACT
Technology has been little involved in the special education models for people with cognitive disabilities, and there are regulations that support their labor insertion under equal conditions, but due to the difficulties that these people present, it is not possible to guarantee their inclusion. The present work has as proposal the development of a prototype of Android application based on beacons technology called "TK-2" for the assistance of people with cognitive disabilities in the execution of tasks, which is designed with activities of ascending difficulty and automatic data collection, which shows results on the screen of the device, thanks to this the data are visible, accurate and reliable. In the execution of tests, users were considered based on the experience (average and none) in the proposed activity. These results were contrasted to determine that the application contributes to gradually reduce the evaluation parameters (time, errors and aids) until the user begins to perform the activity independently, also understood as TK-2 acts in activities that are rare and those that are repetitive.
