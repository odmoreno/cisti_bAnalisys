Performance Evaluation of Big Data Applications in Cloud Providers
ABSTRACT
Due to the amount of computational data generated each year and most often without standardization, the need arose for the development of specific Big Data tools. Currently cloud computing has been chosen as it is widely used in conjunction with Big Data due to its reduced cost and elasticity. Utilization of cloud services has increased over the years and many companies have migrated their computing services to the cloud to reduce the operational costs of maintaining the technology infrastructure. Due to the number of cloud providers available, benchmarking is now considered important for your choice, especially the performance of the specific application in the cloud environment. This paper aims to evaluate MongoDB database performance using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark tool, with 3 cloud application profiles from Google and Microsoft.
