Influence of digital proficiency in geometric skills acquisition in GeoGebra
ABSTRACT
We performed a study to analyze the influence of digital proficiency of prospective teachers in acquiring geometric and didactic skills in a problem-solving scenario using GeoGebra. We present the results of statistical analysis to show that intermediate level students improve their skills. In addition, students prefer to use pen and paper GeoGebra to investigate and conjecture in problem solving processes open and say it is a good resource for teaching geometry.
