Funding for Academy Projects:Vision of Brazil and World
ABSTRACT
Funding is one of the main instruments used to support Research and Development (R&D) in Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Many countries introduce reforms in funding systems to promote excellence, knowledge transfer and socioeconomic innovation as a result of research. Resources for financing originate in the public or private sector. Most research projects in HEI are funded by public funds that are increasingly directed towards the development of innovation according to specific policy guidelines. Funded research involves distributing a considerable amount of money, which can lead HEI to desirable behavior by the funder and align their objectives with research priorities that ensure greater reward. In this paper, the aim is to analyze public funding, since it guarantees the subsistence of researchers and the means to conduct research in HEI, providing an overview of their evolution and current state in particular with regard to the nature and dynamics of funding schemes for research, and how these schemes contribute to their results. To achieve the objectives, a review exploratory of the literature on research funding was carried out in order to investigate its state of the art. The university's research environment has undergone profound changes as well as research funding systems. In current policies, incentives to competition and production are emphasized as a means to make HEIs efficient and productive.
