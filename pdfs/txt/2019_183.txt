Development of an IoT Architecture for an Electronic Cane
ABSTRACT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that is shaping the different aspects of human life. In the IoT paradigm objects become capable of interact with each other, and with the physical environment in which they are inserted without the direct interaction of human beings. Several applications are being created for the most diverse areas of knowledge, either to solve problems or to make systems more efficient. Assistive Technology is a field that is not enough explored yet in this context. In this work, an IoT architecture, customized for an Electronic Cane (device used by the visually impaired), was developed. The five-layer architecture allowed the Electronic Cane to act as a gateway, capable of collecting data from IoT devices, communicating with a cloud system, that stores, analyzes, and displays this data. A prototype was built to validate this architecture, which aims to give more autonomy to the visually impaired.
