Steps to build a thematic repository
ABSTRACT
The achievement of information and knowledge is a common practice of mankind. Thus, the knowledge is preserved and made it transmission to subsequent generations ensuring their own survival and evolution of the human race. With the advent of information produced digitally, it is necessary to ensure new mechanisms for sharing preserve those digital contents in this new “information society”. Regarding health, we find that the available repositories are mostly institutional which prevents the submission of digital contents and their preservation by independent professionals, researchers and students who are not part of them. It also denotes that these repositories have a lot of thesis, leaving out other multimedia resources such as images, videos, 3D models, animations, clinical exams, case studies, among others. The creation of a non-institutional thematic repository aims to contribute to a further spread of this type of resources cataloged with metadata in a global level and provide digital preservation thereof. This paper presents the steps for creating a thematic repository for healthcare.
