Video Content to Support Physical Activity in Older Adults a Strategy for Content Production Centered on User Preferences
ABSTRACT
The need of support when performing physical activity can be especially important, particularly to people that are more propense to falls or injuries as is the case of older adults. Promoting physical activity is a priority challenge and audiovisual content can give an important help to achieve this aim. Nevertheless, it is fundamental that the potential consumers of these contents identify themselves with them and can use them easily to support their practice of physical activity. In this paper, the authors describe a strategy that was followed to develop a set of audiovisual contents potentially capable of supporting the elderly to perform certain physical exercises. This strategy considered various preferences revealed by this group and involved them throughout the development process. Given the widespread use of mobile phones and their potential to be used to support physical activity, this paper also presents an approach for making these contents available within a mobile application that supports physical activity. The results of this stage of a broader study corroborates the idea that older people are predisposed to consume this type of content and recognize it as valuable. It also contributes to better understand in what way this type of content can be delivered in a mobile application that is being developed to support older adults to carry out physical activities plans.
