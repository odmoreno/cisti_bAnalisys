Evaluation and prioritization model of green projects according to supply and demand of resources, an integration between systems dynamics and participatory modeling
ABSTRACT
This research framed in the context of the post-conflict in Colombia, presents a model of systems dynamics for decision-making in the evaluation and prioritization of green projects, based on the dynamics of variables such as the supply and demand of natural water resources and of the soil and likewise, with the participation of the inhabitants through the methodology of participatory modeling. The results obtained through this model of sustainable development show that it is not only possible to control the natural resources of water and soil by creating an alert called reserve margin, but also it is possible to maximize investments in social, environmental or economic projects, previously prioritized through the “citizen factor”, so that they certainly respond to the needs or expectations of the community involved.
