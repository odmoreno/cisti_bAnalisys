Critical Data Security Model: Gap Security Identification and Risk Analysis In Financial Sector
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we proposed a data security model of a big data analytical environment in the financial sector. Big Data can be seen as a trend in the advancement of technology that has opened the door to a new approach to understanding and decision making that is used to describe the vast amount of data (structured, unstructured and semi-structured) that is too time consuming and costly to load a relational database for analysis. The increase in cybercriminal attacks on an organizationâ€™s assets results in organizations beginning to invest in and care more about their cybersecurity points and controls. The management of business-critical data is an important point for which robust cybersecurity controls should be considered. The proposed model is applied in a datalake and allows the identification of security gaps on an analytical repository, a cybersecurity risk analysis, design of security components and an assessment of inherent risks on high criticality data in a repository of a regulated financial institution. The proposal was validated in financial entities in Lima, Peru. Proofs of concept of the model were carried out to measure the level of maturity focused on: leadership and commitment, risk management, protection control, event detection and risk management. Preliminary results allowed placing the entities in level 3 of the model, knowing their greatest weaknesses, strengths and how these can affect the fulfillment of business objectives.
