Dashboard to monitor the Restaurant and Hospitality Financial Support Program
ABSTRACT
In this constantly updating and changing reality, it becomes increasingly important to have information available, in a clear, objective, easy to read and fast way. Thus, there is a need to create a tool capable of providing a better quality of data presentation, monitoring the relevant indicators, and supporting managers in the decision-making process, such as, in this case, the dashboard. In this sense, this research focuses on the development of a tactical dashboard for the Regional Directorate of Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness (DREC), based in Ponta Delgada, island of SÃ£o Miguel, Portugal. Thus, through a questionnaire to promoters and interviews with two specialists, 33 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) were defined, capable of evaluating the Support Program for Restaurants and Hospitality. In this context, a dashboard sheet was developed that presents the KPI, supported on the literature review and in the interviews. The positive evaluation of the dashboard by the experts leads to the conclusion that it is, in fact, possible to monitor the application of the PARH through a dashboard. Additionally, it is understood that this tool can analyze the performance of the PARH with the pre-established objectives. This research allows, not only to contribute to the knowledge of relevant KPI in financial support programs, but also to explore another dashboard directly associated with the perspective of financial support managers and other users, thus facilitating their decision making.
