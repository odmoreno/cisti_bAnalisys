ALS detection through spectral analysis : New parameter and optimizations
ABSTRACT
Mean and variance analysis of the standard deviation of parameters based on the spectral slope of the speech signals demonstrated in previous works the ability to discriminate between speakers diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Bulbar and healthy speakers. This work continues the research of the speech signal spectrum and presents a solution that merges the parameters previous presented and implements a method for detecting outliers by analyzing the dispersion of the parameters. Although the new parameter presents discrimination rates in line with the previous ones, it can be an asset in screening other pathologies associated with the voice. On the other hand, the method for detecting outliers has potential to detect false positives, an improvement in the results obtained. All the parameters presented are easy to analyze and interpret visually, hoping to enhance the analysis of spectra in non-invasive screening situations.
