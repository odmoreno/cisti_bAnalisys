Internet and plagiarism in high school students
ABSTRACT
Plagiarism has been corroborated in the educational field as an intentional or not, of committing fraud in the accreditation of a certain knowledge or competence, which has been increased with the use of the Internet. A quantitative study is presented, which applies the questionnaire based on the Internet Catalunya project to 16,287 high school students in Ecuador. It is proposed as a hypothesis that the use of Internet resources and tools affect the level of plagiarism of high school students. The Chi-square statistic is applied, to determine the existence of correlations of different variables with the level of plagiarism, and k-means to establish categories of students based on the number of hours they devote to different activities on the Internet, obtaining three groups that we have called: a) liabilities, b) chat and video, c) games and videos. As a result, it is obtained that sex and income level directly affect the level of plagiarism; Regarding the number of hours devoted to chat, a dichotomy is shown, since those who spend more time chatting on academic subjects have a lower tendency to plagiarize. In general, the resources and tools available on the Internet in their various forms if they affect the level of plagiarism.
