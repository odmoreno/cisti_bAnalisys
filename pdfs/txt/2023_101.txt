Context-sensitive emotional support system dedicated to health preservation in elderly person in the Republic of Panama
ABSTRACT
The integration of information and communication technologies has radically changed the way health is managed. With the constant miniaturization of integrated devices, the increase in human-computer interactions and their ubiquity have increased the possibilities for intervention in this field of study. The use of context awareness in healthcare faces many challenges. This study aims to present a proposal for a context-aware elderly health monitoring and prevention system that uses sensors, artificial intelligence, cloud storage, mobile development, and machine learning algorithms to detect health problems in elderly people in a timely manner. This system adapts to the needs and preferences of each person and considers the context in which they live, allowing to personalize health care and improve the quality of life of individuals.
