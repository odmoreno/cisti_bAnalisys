Fuzzy logic based heating systems operation scenario selection
ABSTRACT
“Intelligent self-controlled heating system” have widely established their position as a research field during the last decade. The selection of methods to control performance of self-learning heating systems depends on a great number of conditions of the system being researched. Intelligent systems allow developing different scenarios of functioning of the investigated systems. Use of Fuzzy logic in self-learning systems may be used for tackling a wide range of system control and maintain problems (design and analysis of operation scenario and structure, monitor data base management, balancing of production capacities, optimization of heating system rules etc.). This research helps to detect the most problematics scenarios of operation rules selection process, check the efficiency of the decisions taken to select the work strategy and proposes to use a context sensitive and proactive fuzzy logical system for managing intelligent heating systems adaption to specific user.
