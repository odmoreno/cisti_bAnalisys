The use of computer-assisted audit tools and techniques by Portuguese internal auditors
ABSTRACT
The audit procedures are increasingly supported by the use of computer tools, especially in data extraction and analysis procedures. Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATT) are examples of tools used for this purpose, but many other software programs are used to support audits. Considering this growing use of computer tools to support auditing, this study aims to identify the most used tools in the context of the internal audit in Portuguese companies, and to evaluate the factors that may influence the use of those tools. This research, through an inquiry, concludes that internal auditors mostly use generic rather than specific tools in their audit work. The use of specific computer tools to support auditing is influenced by the size of the workplace, more specifically by the size of the audit department. Other factors that also influence the use of these computerized techniques are the experience in auditing and the existence of a certified internal auditor in the workplace.
