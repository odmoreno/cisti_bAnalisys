VSFC - virtual shop floor control: Approach to the problem of programming and control of production through intelligent agents and Breeding Environments
ABSTRACT
Efficient planning and monitoring of the operations carried out in the different resources of a productive system is a highly complex problem, particularly in the current dynamic and competitive environment. From the study of the different solutions proposed in the associated literature, the multi-agent paradigm seems to be the most promising technology, especially for its ability to address distributed problems. The paper presents a new approach based on this technology, in which agents show intelligent behavior thanks to the use of a rule-based expert system. Moreover, the interaction between agents occurs within the context of Breeding Environments, a concept associated with networked organizations. The union of both technologies and this concept allows us to tackle SFC problem from a new perspective.
