Social ethics and responsibility in academic management by using ICTs and social networks at the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja
ABSTRACT
The current management of universities embraces Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as the fundamental basis for achieving an effective integration of curriculum and the development of students' and teachers' innovative competences. ICT-based teaching strategies are the aids proposed by the teacher that allow students to have significant learning experiences with correct information processing. The purpose of the present study is to find the relation between the use of ICT and the learning process from the perspective of ethics and responsibility in the correct application of ICT. The collection of primary information was carried out by using a questionnaire, which was piloted and validated, to 337 students enrolled in the different programs of the Technical Area at the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL). We used a descriptive non-experimental research design and analyzed variables in order to fulfill the objectives of this research.
