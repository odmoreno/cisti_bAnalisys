E-Down: A Methodology to Support the Choice and Configuration of VLEs in the Training of Students with Down Syndrome
ABSTRACT
One of the challenges in basic education is the inclusion of students with Down syndrome (SD) in regular schools. Some studies have already discussed the advantages of using technological resources as mediation tools in literacy processes, as well as the impact of these resources on distance education. However, it is important to analyze and evaluate criteria for choosing and setting up a virtual learning environment (VLE) that considers the needs of students with Down syndrome. Through the use of a VLE, schools and education professionals will have subsidies for the choice, configuration and use of a VLE more appropriate considering the specific needs of students with Down syndrome. As an evaluation, four virtual learning environments were analyzed in terms of adequacy considering the requirements for these students with Down syndrome. An evaluation of the interface and interaction was also carried out, configured in the standard VLE format and in the format of the proposed E-Down methodology, with students with Down syndrome to analyze their use with the selected VLE. And when evaluating the AVA used with the proposed E-Down methodology, it was observed that this configuration was better suited to the needs of people with Down syndrome.
