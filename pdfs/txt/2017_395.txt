Transmedia from university: Case study of DocuMedia model
ABSTRACT
Transmedia non-fiction production has a high degree of experimentation and one of its main focus is set in the academic field. In this case study, the leading proposal is that of getting to know in depth how a project of multimedia social journalism works: DocuMedia, which takes the hybrid form between a producer, a medium and an integrated laboratory in the university. In the development of the article non-participant observation, interview and the qualitative analysis of the transmedia documentary Mujeres en venta are used.
