IT Outsourcing Success Factors In the Portuguese Public Sector: A research proposal
ABSTRACT
Managing information systems with an external provider became a common practice in the public sector mostly due to expectations of reduced costs and better capabilities in this area. ITO is not new to public management practice, in fact, these organizations are known to maintain long term relationships with multiple suppliers, even though the results and the success of ITO in this sector is harder to demonstrate. There is also, a recognition of different priorities and contextual factors that determine ITO success. There also a reduced number of european authors investigating ITO success in the public setor. We acknowledged that none are from Portugal, therefore, we propose to investigate ITO success in the portuguese public setor and evaluate the effect of partnership quality, organizational capabilities and top management support.
