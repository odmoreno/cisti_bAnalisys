ICT management in the agro-industry
ABSTRACT
Human pressure is pushing many of our natural resources to their limits in various regions of the world. Optimize their use is an urgent need. The management of agro-industry has been aware of that need, seeking to improve the productivity and reduce waste throughout the production process, as well by increasing the distribution efficiency of their products. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can support the control/management of the process inputs and outputs in various activities. This article attempts to describe a complete mushroom production chain. The information system developed by the agro-industry company studied allows to acquire, in real-time, the information about what is being produced (quantity and type of mushroom), which products are to be delivered to the different clients and which should be the planning for the next few days.
