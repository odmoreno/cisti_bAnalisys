An Accessible and Connected Digital Textbook
ABSTRACT
The ePub format allows the creation of digital publications by using resources from the open web platform, which are developed by the International Publishing Forum and the World Wide Web Consortium to advance open-format documents accessible to people with disabilities. Despite its growing popularity, particularly for fiction books, there still exist obstacles to incorporating digital didactic books with the same interactive elements as their printed counterparts. This study aimed to examine the interactivity capabilities of the ePub format for didactic materials, enabling students to complete exercises within digital books. We also developed an ePub file that allows readers to fill questions through forms and receive answers in an accessible manner. Additionally, we implemented a method for transmitting the results of the exercises to a platform for teachers to access, and for data to be exported to other platforms.
