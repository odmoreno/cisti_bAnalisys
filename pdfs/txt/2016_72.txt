Metrics focused on usability ISO 9126 based
ABSTRACT
Research related to software metrics are becoming increasingly important and widespread. A topic that grew in this area is the measurement of software quality with a focus on usability. Setting a metric focused on usability can help project managers to track design progress and support in making decisions about when a product should be released. However, it is necessary to select appropriate measurement models that offer simple and useful results for the component selection process. The objective of this work is to define an appropriate set of metrics from a set of options that offer similar functionality. The research was developed based on ISO 9126-1: 2000 analyzing the usability features and sub-features and bibliographic review of the main research questions. A general approach was defined and metrics will be submitted for assessment to be validated.
