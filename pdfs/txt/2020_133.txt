3D Virtual Content for Education Applications
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present the process of creating 3D models to develop augmented reality applications-oriented to the teaching-learning process. We present the process of creating three-dimensional models from conceptualization, polygonal modeling in 3ds max, creation of mapping coordinates in RizomUV, to the process of creating PBR materials in specialized soft-ware such as Substance Designer, Alchemist, and export and importation to Unity 3D. The developed models are incorporated into a virtual reality platform, which allows to exploring the flora and fauna of the Cotopaxi National Park, Latacunga, Ecuador.
