Open data government in Equador. Assesing information provide in web portals of local and regional level
ABSTRACT
This article presents the results of an investigation that evaluated the transparency of the web portals of the municipal and provincial governments of Ecuador. It is a quantitative approach study that takes a stratified random sample of 122 web portals of municipal governments and the universe of 24 provincial governments. A rubric was designed to evaluate the 20 transparency indicators in accordance with current regulations and the technical criteria issued by the regulatory bodies of the Ecuadorian State. The transparency index of each of the portals evaluated was obtained. The average score, on a maximum scale of one hundred, is 39 for the portals of municipal governments and 64 for provincial governments. It seems that there is an influence between the region of the country to which the government belongs and the transparency index obtained, governments of the Sierra region have slightly higher scores. The degree of compliance with the indicators evaluated seems to be independent of the complexity of the information required in it, so that each government evaluated obtains very close scores in each group. The population size of the municipality is a predictor of the transparency index obtained A high degree of standardization has been achieved in the presentation format of public information in web portals.
