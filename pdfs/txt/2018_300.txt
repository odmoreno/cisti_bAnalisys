Transmedia discourse at the local and hyperlocal sphere
ABSTRACT
The reformulation of the media ecosystem puts the focus on new communication channels towards more active users. In a transmedia scenario under construction - emerging in journalism -, the role of local and hyperlocal media is reinforced by participation in stories and information processes. This study presents the most widespread practices of transmedia journalism and the current state of hyperlocal media, in order to identify initiatives in development and to the future. Together with sustainability and experimentation in the media, the value of the community and proximity are protagonists in a glocal and transmedia expansion.
