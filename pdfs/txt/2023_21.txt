IoT Smart Collect - Routing Process and Driver Guidance
ABSTRACT
Waste collection is a traditional process that involves a driver collecting waste from a set of designated deposits based on a pre-determined route. The authors present a new approach that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to define the route based on the occupancy volume of the deposits. The new process involves the use of a mobile application to assist the driver during the journey. The application communicates with the central system to receive information on the next route, calculates the best possible route considering traffic laws and road conditions, and guides the driver throughout the journey. The application also provides real-time updates on the driverâ€™s progress and allows the driver to provide feedback All collected data is stored and can be consulted and explored through lists, graphs, and filtering options. The authors believe that the new approach will improve the efficiency of waste collection and provide a better experience for the driver.
