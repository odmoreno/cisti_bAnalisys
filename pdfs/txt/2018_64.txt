Consumption of musical content and movies/series online in Portugal
ABSTRACT
This study addresses the online consumption of music and movies online, according to the frequency of Internet use. The time spent on Internet goes beyond a simple search or checking the email. Although globalization implies visualizing a trend among various subcultures, the present study seeks to understand if there are differences in the Portuguese users' behavior or perceptions about the consumption of Internet contents in terms of music (or music videos) and movies and television series. Are there sociodemographic differences among Portuguese users? Are the Portuguese users' choices homogeneous in how often they use the Internet to access music and movies online? The answer to these research questions is the purpose of this study. Using the Flash Eurobarometer 437 database, it is identified that age is significantly related to the frequency of using the Internet to access music and movies online. It is also observed that gender is significantly related to frequency of using the Internet to access movies online. The choices facing the Portuguese respondents are not homogeneous regarding the frequency of Internet use to access music and movies online as observed in six clusters with different characteristics. These results can be an indication that policies concerning the music and movies contents should fit the characteristics of each of these clusters.
