Requirements Elicitation and Specification for Educational Technology Development: A Systematic Literature Mapping
ABSTRACT
The present work aimed to map the various requirements engineering techniques and methodologies for the construction of educational technologies through a systematic mapping study. The research protocol of this mapping included the planning, execution, and analysis of the results phases. This research added information about the diversity of methods and techniques of requirements engineering applied in the process of developing educational technologies. However, this research indicated that the phenomena related to the pedagogical practice experienced by teachers and students are sometimes relegated in this process. This work analyzed the primary studies of the last ten years, making it possible to identify gaps in this area of research to propose research and the generation of new forms of work in the development of educational systems.
