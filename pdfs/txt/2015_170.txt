Teaching programming for high school students using the Lego Mindstorms robot
ABSTRACT
The construction of algorithms isn't an easy task for students that start undergraduate computer courses in Brazil. Several Brazilian universities reported that the percentage of desistance and failures in basic programming logic courses can reach 60%. However, there are mechanisms that can minimize this number. One such mechanism is composed of pedagogical practices in order to enter high school students in recreational environments that enable the learning of programming logic. Within this context the aim of this work is to use, as playful object, robotics kit Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0, model 8547, in promoting the learning of programming logic. To verify the feasibility of this proposal the authors of this paper conducted an experiment with four students from the high school. After the experiment, the students were subjected to reviews and the results obtained were satisfactory.
