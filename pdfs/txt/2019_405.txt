Millennials' trends in luxury marketing: The ecoturism
ABSTRACT
One of the current trends in the luxury market is the development of offers targeted to the millennial generation. In fact, this generation is seen as a potentiator of market growth, considering that the future of the luxury sector will depend on the capacity to reach this generation. This topic is particularly relevant for the marketing area, namely for the tourism sector. Another of the major trends for the tourism sector is the sustainability issue, with an emphasis on ecotourism. In this work we discuss the main contributions of the literature that allow to interlink the domains of luxury marketing, millennial generation, and ecotourism, proposing a set of hypotheses for future research.
