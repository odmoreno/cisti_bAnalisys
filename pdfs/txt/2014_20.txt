Framework for applications of support to the activities of integrated care
ABSTRACT
The population ageing requires new approaches to optimize the available resources. In particular, it is urgent to evolve for an effective care integration, which requires toconsider aspects of people's daily lives that impact on their health conditions. Therefore, the information interoperability has an increasing importance, not only the interoperability of health related information, but also social context related information. In this paper, we propose a framework for the creation of applications for information recording, based on a generic and flexible information model, for the provision of integrated care.
