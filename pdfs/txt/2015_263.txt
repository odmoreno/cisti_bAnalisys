The gamer's soul never dies: Review of digital games for an active ageing
ABSTRACT
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the way in which a game thinking can encourage an active ageing and lifestyle. Although recent developments in game studies have heightened the potential of games for stimulating cognitive and physical capacities, its impact on the sense of security and participation in society, which are essential variables to characterize active ageing, have been overlook. This fact may be due to the current debate towards the concept of `active ageing.' This paper reports on the state-of-the-art of games designed for an active ageing, discussing the main recommendations for addressing games to the older target group.
