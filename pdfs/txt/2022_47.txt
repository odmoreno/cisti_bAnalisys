A Natural and Intuitive Virtual Environment for Monitoring and Control of Electric Power Substations
ABSTRACT
Virtual Reality-based systems can provide intuitive and distinct three-dimensional user interfaces compared to traditional two-dimensional layouts. Such systems give the users physical and cognitive immersion, which results in a mental model that is quite consistent with field operation. In this work, we present the development aspects and a case study of a solution based on Virtual Reality to provide a more natural and intuitive environment for controlling electrical operation centers. The solution intends to minimize the issues caused by the operation of electric power substations due to the lack of spatial and functional information on the traditional operation interfaces. The research is being carried out with the collaboration between the energy electric company of Minas Gerais–Brazil (CEMIG) and the Federal University of Uberlândia. Besides operating generation and transmission actives, the environment presents great potential for the training of operators and other professionals of support and maintenance.
