The role of digital influencers on the intention to purchase fashion products
ABSTRACT
The study analyzes the impact that digital influencers (DI) have on the purchase intention of fashion products by their followers. In today's world, where there is growing digitization, DI have come to play a key role in their followers' intention to purchase fashion products. In this way, the purpose of our work is to determine the main direct and indirect antecedents of the intention to purchase fashion products. The results found that the ID attributes (expertise, trust and homophily) proved to be direct determinants of involvement with the ID message process and indirect determinants of the purchase intention through perceived brand value, brand satisfaction and brand attitude. It thus aims to fill a gap in the research on the attributes of DI that most stimulate their followers' intention to buy fashion products.
