AGraphAR: A library for the support of graphs in augmented reality interactive games
ABSTRACT
Recent technological developments in web browsers related to the ability to natively capture and process media from local devices and render 3D computer graphics, in particular due to the evolution of HTML5 and its associated APIs, such as WebGL, make it possible to provide virtual augmented reality applications directly from the web environment. In this paper we present a library for the representation and construction of graph based interactive augmented reality games implemented for the web environment. There is a lot of applications, particularly in the context of serious games and in particular those dealing with education, that internally represents information or concepts in a graph-like structure and that could benefit from the appealing look of augmented reality. The herein described library greatly simplifies the development of these applications by encapsulating operations management of the graph and taking care of the main challenges from the aspect of augmented reality. In order to test and validate the library three interactive activities are described.
