Partial ISDB-Tb receiver implemented on a software defined radio platform
ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose the implementation of the digital terrestrial television receiver under the ISDB-Tb (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestial Build-in) standard for the mobile service in the device based in Radio Defined by Software USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral). The implemented reception system allows recovering the digital signal in narrow band to observe in real time the different channels and at the same time determine its quality through objective measures. A mathematical algorithm was implemented for the perfect synchronization in time and frequency of the signal of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), reducing the harmful effects of channel and increasing receiver efficiency.
