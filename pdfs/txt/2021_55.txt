ABSTRACT
The transformation of the media environment that affects television forces it to interconnect with its audiences through multiple channels, among which the Instagram social network highlights. The approach to television promotional strategies on social networks requires adaptation according to the age, interests and needs of the target audiences. In this sense, expansive narratives have been used as a claim to offer wider viewing experiences linked to multiscreen audiovisual consumption and spreaded thought social networks used as a broadcaster. This study focuses on identifying the strategies used by Radio Televisión Española (RTVE) to cater to its diverse audience by analyzing the Instagram profile of the series “HIT” aimed at a general audience, and the series “Wake up” of RTVE's Playz platform aimed at a youth audience. To each profile is carried out an analysis of the publications identifying the type of content according to the classic or expansive promotional classification. The period of analysis runs from 24 January, with the first publication of the profile, to 23 November 2020 of “HIT”, and in the case of “Wake up” from 24 March 2018 to 11 December 2018, which corresponds to the first season in both cases. 179 publications on “HIT” profile and 153 in the case of “Wake up” has been treated as analysis corpus.
