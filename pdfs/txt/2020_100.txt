Specialized Applications Based on Incremental Access and their Sharing
ABSTRACT
Companies use information systems as a necessary support for their business. Typical applications relate to conventional processes, such as the manufacture or sale of products. In addition to these common applications, the company also uses specialized applications. The specialized applications consist of the specific functionalities and they are used for support of the working activities of the limited group of users. These applications are for a specific company e.g. only one functional role when this role is necessary for running the organization, but it is also represented by only one or two workers. The development of those specific applications is not interesting for ordinary software companies, because such applications are wanted by a very small amount of potential users. The sharing of the specialized applications is possible by the workers with the same functional role in different organizations. However, specialized functional roles do not have to have the same conditions. The article describes the suggestion for the procedure of how to share the specialized applications based on incremental access.
