Learning Analytics to close the gap in digital literacy of SMEs
ABSTRACT
To transform an organization, it isnâ€™t possible to ignore the people aspect and the significant impact of talent development in any transformation process. While in larger organizations, there is often access to more resources that ultimately could bring the needed competencies to successfully run such a complex program, in small or medium enterprises, the resources are more limited and the access to talent more difficult, forcing a potential more aggressive strategy in developing the digital skills needed to enable their transformation. This work aims to review some of the literature and better comprehend the role of learning analytics as a practice that could potentially be used to enhance the learning process within Small and Medium Enterprises and support the improvement of digital literacy within these companies.
