MoniCovid: Monitoring System for Patients with Symptoms of COVID-19
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, more than 2,1 million confirmed cases had been reported in Peru of people infected by COVID-19. According to the Ministry of Health data, an increase in the occupancy of Intensive Care Unit beds is observed. This high number of cases added to the capacity of few hospital beds causes the increase in patients whom medical centres in Peru cannot treat. We present MoniCovid as an application to monitor health parameters periodically and ensure the treatment and stability for patients with suspicions or mild COVID-19 symptoms and who belong to the low socioeconomic levels that represent more than half of the Peruvian population. In addition, it allows physicians to review follow-up reports for each patient and determine if they need emergency care. We use the methodology of Building Progressive Web Apps book to incorporate native functionality into the web application. In this way, MoniCovid becomes a multiplatform capable application that allows it to be acquired by many patients. A case study in Lima showed that MoniCovid application is functional and allows reducing the time of patient monitoring and medical diagnosis by 70.89% and 56.56% respectively. In addition, a user acceptance of 4.74 in usability and 4.71 in user experience.
