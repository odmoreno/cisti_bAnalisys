Electronic games for curricular learning in mother and foreign languages
ABSTRACT
It is imperative to continue thinking and reinventing education because technologies and the Web are redefining where, when and from whom we learn. The motivation to learn can be awakened in students by creating playful environments capable of reconciling the knowledge acquisition in the classroom and practice learning. Authors from different study fields have recognized the multiple possibilities of videogames for learning and for interdisciplinary use. Education can benefit from the potential of these artefacts if properly integrated into the educational process. This article describes an ongoing learning experience based on electronic games. It also presents some preliminary results of the ARCADE games type application in Wordshoot; Flashcards; Matching Pair; Manic Miner and Cannonball Fun formats. This experience is being made with Portuguese and French vocabulary, grammar and school curriculum learning, both in Elementary and Vocational Education.
