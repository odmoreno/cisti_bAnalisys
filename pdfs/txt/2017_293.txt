IT governance: Progress and challenges on public administration
ABSTRACT
Organizations are increasingly dependent on Information Technology (IT) and IT Management takes on greater importance each day. However the role of IT Management in many organizations has not gone much beyond being considered as a technological support and not as the strategic ally. Public institutions are no stranger to this reality. The present article presents the characteristics and It governance maturity level in 10 Peruvian public institutions as a result of a survey directed to 59 IT managers, on the principles of ISO/IEC 38500. The results show that there are weaknesses in the IT governance implementation and it is necessary to initiate a sensitization process to the authorities at the highest level to improve the current situation.
