Mobile application based on gamification to promote microlearning in Software Engineering
ABSTRACT
The teaching processes in Software Engineering discipline have an inherent challenge in motivating students to adopt in their professional performance. This challenge involves defining new teaching strategies or redesigning existing strategies. Microlearning is an educational strategy characterized by its agility and shortness of lessons and learning units. The strategy goal is providing knowledge and skills in a more dynamic way than the traditional one. However, the implementation of this strategy requires the use of technology to facilitate its adoption. Therefore, in this work, a mobile application based on gamification is presented to promote microlearning in contexts related to Software Engineering. This application is a mobile version of the lottery or bingo game. A widely spread game, consisting of a set of cards and an indefinite number of cards randomly distributed on boards. The variation proposed as a microlearning strategy consists of the identification of concepts and definitions associated with Software Engineering. From the functional tests of the application, it is evident that it allows the teacher to plan, execute and assess the teaching-learning process and the interaction, competence, and assimilation of concepts for the students.
