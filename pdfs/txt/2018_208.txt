Sigma (σ) from sums of unequal size samples, a conjecture: Heterogeneous remote servers, over the Internet: Statistics for manufacturing processes
ABSTRACT
The Internet is a medium that can be used for computing to solve a variety of problems, such as those from industry or academia, also making collaboration easier. This text illustrates our methodology of computing “over the Internet”, and presents a conjecture in Statistics to determine σ (standard deviation) from sums of samples of unequal size. The computing application runs on heterogeneous remote servers in parallel, one in Linux and one in Windows, as might befit a company. The conjecture is “verified” by Monte Carlo, a typically time-consuming technique, itself suggesting parallelization. We have here as objectives: to propose a solution to the statistical problem; to show the use of heterogeneous remote parallel servers; and to point to the Internet as a suitable computing medium. This problem and a number of others can be freely solved on the authors' webpages.
