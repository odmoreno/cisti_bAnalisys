Determinants of the survival of entrepreneurial businesses in Peru during COVID-19
ABSTRACT
This study aims to identify significant factors for the survival of Peruvian micro-firms in the context of COVID-19. For this purpose, we collected data from 125 micro-firms, and we used structural equation modelling to analyze this data. Loyalty, external knowledge, knowledge development and entrepreneurial orientation were analyzed as predictors of business survival. Our results confirm that customer loyalty, external knowledge and knowledge development have a positive and significant impact on the survival of Peruvian micro-firms.
