Eye Senior Getting Information Adjusted to Seniors with Blindness or Low Vision
ABSTRACT
Europe and the rest of the world are facing an abrupt and continuous increase in the number of older people, thus creating several societal challenges'. The integration of older people into social life, as well as creating the conditions for them to age in a participatory, independent and autonomous way require that various stakeholders in society organize themselves and develop solutions according to individuals' needs. Most of the elderly face modifications at the sensory level, namely in terms of visual acuity, which can be manifested by loss of visual quality as a normal consequence of the aging process or by eye diseases that are typical in advanced ages (e.g.: cataracts). EyeSenior intends to be a service that gathers news from several informative sources, allowing seniors with blindness or low vision to access the information. Thus, the project aims to promote seniors' autonomy and independence as well as their integration and participation in community life.
