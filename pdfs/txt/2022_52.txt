Use of the Hefesto v2.0 methodology to implement a Data warehouse: Case applied COVID-19
ABSTRACT
The objective of this article is to present the proposal for the design and construction of a data repository with the intention of storing facts related to the current situation of COVID-19 and obtaining relevant and precise information for decision-making in the face of the latent risk of contagion. The motivation for this study arises from the need to centralize reliable and easily accessible information for monitoring cases in the face of the pandemic. Likewise, the use of the Hephaestus v2.0 methodology is proposed to guide the development of the Data warehouse step by step, which guarantees the success of the implementation. As an added value, the use of emerging technologies Microsoft SQL server 2019 and Visual Studio 2022 are integrated. The results presented will serve as an applied case study for information system administrators in the construction of data repositories and business intelligence solutions. Likewise, it contributes to the research line of scientific studies that integrate accepted and recognized methodologies or standards with emerging technologies.
