Gamification Applied to School Newspaper Development
ABSTRACT
With the evolution of media and the internet in general in the last few years, we see an increase in accessibility and ease of use of many platforms, services, social media, and other communication/media outlets. Even though a lot of what is being created and improved has many benefits to society, it also comes with negative aspects for many users with a big emphasis on the young public. With the rise of media creation through many different and new formats, there is a significant increase of audio-visual stimuli available for consumption. In teens, the effects of such stimuli result in negative behaviours like the decrease of self-learning capabilities, the decrease of interest in extracurricular activities, the decrease of critical thinking, among many other factors. In this paper we will talk about a project that presents itself as a solution to combat disinformation and to encourage an educated and responsible cultural participation. This project is based on the development of an online writing tool that seeks to encourage critical thinking, selection of information sources and assessment of their credibility. It looks to impact the writing of school newspapers by creating a platform that allows students to easily develop stories by using the many features available. Connected to the project and considering the target audience being composed of a younger audience (12 to 18 years of age), during this paper there will be a big focus on the topic of gamification and how it can be a clever approach to keep users engaged and motivated.
