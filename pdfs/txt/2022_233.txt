Analysis of the Presence of Female Students in Computer Engineering Schools : An Application Methodology in Order to Change the trend
ABSTRACT
The so-called STEM subjects constitute a huge focus of interest from the academic world and from institutions, especially if we look at a gender perspective. If the case of Computer Engineering is analyzed, the results obtained are enormously surprising. In the 2018-19 academic year, female enrollments in Computer Engineering were only 1.08% of new female enrollments (in the case of Spain). And from this date it seems that the trend continues and even worsens. In the same way it happens in the countries around us. In this work we try to collect data, make a reflection and give some guidelines that help change the trend, starting from the scarce bibliography that is available in this regard.
