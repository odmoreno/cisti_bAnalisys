Literature review of educational immersive virtual reality solution functionality classification
ABSTRACT
An increase in the immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology accessibility impacts the number of developed solutions that are becoming widely used in education. The developed solutions greatly vary based on the IVR devices they use, their functionalities, and expected learning goals or outcomes. Currently there is a lack of clear definition of the difference between these solutions based on their functional possibilities and presented content. A clear classification scheme of the IVR learning solutions based on functionalities could help better define these solutions. This work presents the findings from a literature review of previous works attempting to identify different types of IVR educational solutions based on their functionalities. The identification of object for the development classification scheme is also described.
