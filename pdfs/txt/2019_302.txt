Fuzzy Cognitive Maps to Evaluate the Influence of the Infants About Home Buying Decisions
ABSTRACT
The child has become a key member of the family nucleus, taking a key role on decision making. He is constantly involved directly or indirectly in decisions regarding the consumption products. Having said that the child becomes the object of study, therefore it's important to evaluate the impact a child in the purchase of food products using a fuzzy neural model. This methodology consists of two phases. Phase 1 evaluates all involved agents (child, parents, product) independently and pointing out that the latter two present some inconsistencies due to the structure of the model. Finally, in phase two of the model consists of combining phase one output variables infant, parents and products evidencing coherence between the level of influence estimated and the level of influence established for a particular scenario.
