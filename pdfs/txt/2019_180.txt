App for More Inclusive Urban Mobility a Prototype in Development
ABSTRACT
Mobile devices are part of the everyday life of the modern citizen. Currently these devices are used for simple dayto- day tasks, where we need information available on the web or on the mobile device itself (smartphone, tablet, etc.). One area where a number of mobile applications have emerged is urban mobility, for route planning and the use of transport networks. However, few applications have addressed this issue considering the needs of users with some type of disability. This paper describes the development of an Android app intended to be used to provide information on urban mobility, including transport accessibility features. It is intended that this mobile application will provide its users with information about the public transport of a certain city and its schedules including routes covered by each transport and the accessibility of each of them. The application intends to allow to choose the best options, according to the profile of the user its geographical location and the accessibility features of the means of transport of that geographical area.
