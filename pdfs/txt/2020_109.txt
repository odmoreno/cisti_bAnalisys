Incidence of Flipped Classroom model in the Learning of Differential Calculation in the William Shakespeare School, Quito-Ecuador
ABSTRACT
This research work aimed to determine the incidence of the Flipped Classroom model in learning Differential Calculation. For this, an exploratory, descriptive and correlational research model was applied. The case study was raised with an experimental group of third-year students from the William Shakespeare Educational School, located in Quito-Ecuador where a new Flipped Classroom pedagogical model was implemented and a control group that worked with the traditional model. As support to the FC model a search or creation of tutorial videos was made by students from their homes and then upload to the Edpuzzle platform. In classes the time was allocated to reinforce, expand and consolidate the knowledge acquired, investing the class and getting the student be the protagonist and responsible for their own learning. The results showed that 90% of the experimental group get grades higher than 9/10; while in the control group only 70% get grades higher than 9/10 which allows to conclude that the FC model has a positive impact on the learning of differential calculus; also a strengthening in the capacity for teamwork, inquiry, commitment to the use of technology and intrinsic values of the human being such as respect for the ideas of their peers, tolerance and self-evaluation of the work developed.
