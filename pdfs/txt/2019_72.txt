Bringing a Micro Enterprise towards the ISO 29110
ABSTRACT
The aim of this paper was to select a set of software tools to facilitate the adoption of the ISO/IEC 29110 basic profile in a very small entity (VSE). The tools suggested in the Gartner quadrant were compared and selected based on cost, popularity and available documentation. The set of chosen tools were applied in a case study by a web software project under activities on which the VSE was based. This work shows how common processes of a VSE coincide with processes suggested by the standard. At the end of the project, an appreciation survey was applied to the project stakeholders, demonstrating that the daily tools used by a software VSE help to approach the standard. Avoiding to increase the learning curve and resistance to change of new tools.
