A game about biology for biology students cell life as a learning tool
ABSTRACT
Educational games can be a good practice when the students already have an abstract idea of the learning content but the knowledge is not consolidated. The presented work is the development of a new biology game: the Cell Life game. The content of the game relies in the biology classes of the 10th and 11th grade of the Portuguese educational system, the two last years of biology education of the “Curso Científico - Humanistico de Ciências e Tecnologias”, enabling the students to dynamically interact with the cell environment and learn the concepts involved in the official teaching guidelines. The making of the game was based on an extensive research on the biology concept of the life of a cell, the techniques for the development of the images and scenarios, the analysis of different types of existing games, namely the interaction between the user and the game context as an educational tool.
