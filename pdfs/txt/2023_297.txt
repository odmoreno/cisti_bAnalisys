IT Management: Proposal of the PI2M-ITGov - Panel of Indicators for Monitoring and Maintaining IT Governance : Research and Model
ABSTRACT
Due to IT resources - Information Technology being very expensive and vital for the survival of Organizations in todayâ€™s highly competitive world, it is essential to know how these are being applied and what effective results are being achieved. Thus, as is done in other Areas of Management, applying a Set of Indicators - related to IT - can help in assessing the performance scenario and subsidize decision-making in the event that initiatives need to be replanned. In this way, this work proposes the PI2MITGov-Panel of Indicators for Monitoring and Maintenance of Information Technology Governance, being the same, result of the development of a research for Post-Doctorate. The PI2M-ITGov covers 12 (twelve) IT Areas and applies 36 (thirty-six) Sub-KMIs Key Monitoring Subindicators. This research was built following the DSR - Design Science Research flow and the constructs and artifacts created (Guidelines and Worksheets) are available at the links provided. The simulation (through a Case Study), in a real world of the proposals presented here, showed an acceptable level of the tools as an effective planning resource.
