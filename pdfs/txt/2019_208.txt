Conceptual model to represent body signals in the learning process
ABSTRACT
Several educators, for decades have been contributing to the education join more theory and practice. However, the learning strategies need to be based on the diversity of styles present in the classroom, having the teacher first understood the student's need through the interpretation of their emotions, expressed from body signals such as heart beats, temperature, brain waves, facial and body expressions. Thus, the objective of this work is to study and propose a model to represent these body signals and relate them to the learning process, using computational resources based on technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data and the internet of things by means of 4 steps: selection of technologies; signal capture; identification and analysis of captured data; and analysis based on theories and learning styles. As for the methodology, it presents an approach of a qualitative and quantitative nature and a theoretical basis based on bibliographic research. The research is under development.
