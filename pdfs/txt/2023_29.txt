PLS: Estructural model of the entrepreneurial behaviour
ABSTRACT
There are several studies developed that address the main factors that are related to the development and consolidation of entrepreneurships. However, there are still few investigations about the characteristics and behavior of entrepreneurs as individuals. This article deals with some of the main traits of entrepreneurs, where the relationships between entrepreneurial passion, entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial behavior are analyzed. In the research, partial least squares structural equation modeling is applied to a sample of 424 participants. The main results allow validating the proposed model where it is reflected that there is a significant and positive effect of entrepreneurial passion on entrepreneurial self-efficacy. In the same way, it is detected that the entrepreneurial passion has a positive and significant effect on the entrepreneurial behavior; just as entrepreneurial self-efficacy has a positive and significant impact on the entrepreneurial attitude behavior. These findings are relevant to continue advancing in the understanding of the characteristics and main drivers of the entrepreneur, which lead him to start his venture. Finally, this is especially important to understand the behavior of individuals and the main key features that shape their actions when starting a business.
