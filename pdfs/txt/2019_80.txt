ABSTRACT
At a time when comments are growing in social networks, e-commerce sites, sites dedicated to information, etc., the technic of opinion mining has finally emerged as the essential tool for processing these data. In the literature, approaches and many methods have been proposed to analyze the texts of official languages (French, English, Portuguese...). Recent solutions increasingly provide results close to reality. However, the complexity of comments from Senegalese online presses question the performance of current methods of opinion mining. The purpose of this article is to highlight the obstacles that these comments may cause with regard to current methods. In perspective, we will try to propose a possible solution to analyze the comments of Senegalese in order to predict their opinion.
