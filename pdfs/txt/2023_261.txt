Digital Transformation in the Public Sector: Preliminary Results of a Tertiary Literature Review
ABSTRACT
Digital Transformation (DT) in the public sector has gained significant attention in academic research in recent years. However, for researchers and practitioners, identifying relevant studies and developing a general understanding of what is happening in the field is a non-trivial task, given the number of existing studies and literature reviews. Thus, this article presents a tertiary research representing state of the art regarding this phenomenon. In this context, the search returned 622 secondary studies, of which 33 were thoroughly analyzed. The analysis showed how the DT process occurs in the public sector and the necessary resources; the main factors that motivated this occurrence; and the benefits brought. We also present seven suggestions for future research.
