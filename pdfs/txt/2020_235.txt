Why is the Intellectual Capital today more important than ever?
ABSTRACT
The intellectual capital is the final source of wealth creation in companies. Thus, the need arises to know, what it is, how to measure it, and what its value is. The literature relevant to it, needs much clarification regarding this. The purpose of this paper is to find out if there is any relationship between intellectual capital and business performance. Together with knowing what kind of studies exist, it constitutes the research question. The paper's contribution is reflected in the exhibition, a summary of the studies that would otherwise appear isolated. As more outstanding results, it is worth mentioning the fact that business performance is conditioned by the context of the empirical studies carried out and the concept of profiled intellectual capital. We conclude that studies with more generic definitions of intellectual capital, with more objective ways of measuring it and, therefore, obtaining its value, would appear more in line with the knowledge of the relationship between intellectual capital and business performance.
