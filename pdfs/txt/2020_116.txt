ABSTRACT
Enterprise Architecture has been growing as an approach used to add value to the sectors of organizations, providing the necessary support to the planning and integration of the business and Information Technology areas. Thus, the required actions are directed towards the achievement of the strategic goals defined by senior management. Hence, this article presents the state-of-the-art of Enterprise Architecture in which, through some defined research questions, we have explored the studies obtained in a systematic mapping of the literature. The proposed secondary study has selected and analyzed the necessary evidence to identify definitions of the term, countries that use it most, corporate segments, frameworks used, as well as the benefits and challenges reported by these companies.
