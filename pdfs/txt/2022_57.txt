Online platform for viewing trends and opinions on sports events based on Social Media Data
ABSTRACT
Data extraction and processing of social media are complementary and sometimes fundamental to support decision making in several businesses. Sports events are no exception and can benefit from these techniques. In this context, sports clubs can take advantage of the information obtained from social media during events to support decisions that can improve the spectator experience and thus attract more audiences. This work presents a proposal for a web platform, aligned with the UX and UI good practices, that helps sports clubs and television content producers, to easily visualize social data, during a specific sport event or later, collected through the Twitter social network.
