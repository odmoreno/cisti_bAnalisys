Use of computer tools in the design of Trajectories of Study and Research (TSR)
ABSTRACT
In this work we extend and complete a new didactical device that we are experiencing so-called Trajectory of Study and Research (TSR). The TSR model that we propose is located at Engineering Schools, where we are teaching. By the instrumental nature that has the mathematical activity in this environment, in the TSR which we are designing has a strong role, on the one hand, the mathematical modeling (understood as functional teaching of mathematics), and on the other hand, the computer tool is used as natural instrument of mathematical work in the construction of projects which give answers to problematic situations. The raison d'Ãªtre of the mathematical activity appears linked to related issues with the engineering world.
