Analysis of the Impact of Business Intelligence in Public Administration
ABSTRACT
Business Intelligence is important in Public Administration (PA) to analyze the efficiency and performance of services and prevent fraud. However, the lack of wide application prevents these objectives from being fully achieved. This article aims to evaluate and publicize various Business Intelligence initiatives in the Portuguese Public Administration and their contribution to improving the performance of the PA, such as, for example, by reducing bureaucracy, by allowing simplified access to indicators, by automating some operations, among others. The methodology used is the analysis of scientific articles available in reference databases, such as Scopus and B-on. This work intends to contribute to a greater perception of Business Intelligence in the Portuguese Public Administration in the last ten years. Thus, it is possible to understand that although BI is necessary to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, there are still areas where BI has a lack of application.
