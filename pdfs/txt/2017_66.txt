Developing anti-bribery organization system based on quantitative pair-wise information an approach based on activity theory
ABSTRACT
Nowadays an important issue, for an organization is to be able to implement relevant anti-bribery risk management systems with mandatory laws. Managers strive to reach an equilibrium between a pure mandatory rule oriented organization and people freedom of choice to mitigate bribery on organization. The problem is how to develop and manage efficiently anti-bribery system in an organization without putting at risk its day by day operation. They are concerned how to balance between deep control and flexible way of people work on organization. The purpose of this document is to introduce a decision-making way of defining a context to establish an anti-bribery risk management system in accordance with the best practices. To address this matter, we will support our work in a theoretical framework for the analysis of human work and introduce anti-bribery as non-functional requirement (generic qualities of services) of organization information systems.
