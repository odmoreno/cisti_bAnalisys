Enhancing learning through a novel decision tool
ABSTRACT
This paper carries on with the work of developing a network lab where a set of well-known techniques have been applied in order to allow remote access. This laboratory has been proven with several groups of students during the last three years. This experience showed the need of a tool designed to let students agree among them. It was a demand from practices where the work implied big teams, and making decisions without seeing each other was a rising problem. Therefore a novel tool has been developed. This tool works like a forum, with the ability of voting. Thus, students can insert proposals and vote them while making decisions in a simple way. In addition, the proposals can be organized in an intuitive structure, without the intervention of moderators. This paper describes this new utility, the fields where it is used and some empiric results from the experience.
