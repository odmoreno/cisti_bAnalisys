Systematization of clinical care based on paradigms of ubiquitous computing: A case study
ABSTRACT
Objective: Provide a tool to support the systematization of clinical care in all medical specialties using mobile, pervasive and ubiquitous computing technologies, to assist in the registration/research directly into the patient's bedside. Methods: In this context we used the ubiquitous computing paradigms for managing a relational database from software with open source. Results: Allow interbreeding information promoting research, composition of the patient's history, allows multiuser access between healthcare professionals and reduce the service time in the registration of patient information. Conclusion: The adoption of this technology solution can help: systematize/standardize the data collected in the clinical records, assist in medical reasoning on diagnostic hypotheses, facilitate treatment and monitoring of patients and the optimization of the acquisition, storage, search and use of patient information.
