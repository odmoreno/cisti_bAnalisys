A tabu search optimization module for scheduling: Design and integration in the open source tool LibrePlan for project management
ABSTRACT
In this paper we describe a tabu search based approach to the scheduling problem in project management and its integration in the LibrePlan open source software tool. A description of the key elements of the algorithm is provided, together with the execution of three use cases with LibrePlan, that shows how feasible plannings are obtained, achieving a noticeable reduction in the makespan of the projects.
