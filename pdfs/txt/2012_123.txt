A platform for the gathering, agregation and integration of social information
ABSTRACT
Electronic Health Records (EHR) applications have evolved a lot in recent years taking advantage of the strong growth of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the healthcare sector. With the existence of multiple solutions to solve the problems of systemic interoperability would be expected a greater and quicker rise of these applications within, and beyond, healthcare systems. The integrated and continued care is a new paradigm that seeks to ensure that all users, depending on their specific situation, have access to the type and intensity of care that actually need, when and where it is needed, depends on the involvement of formal and informal caregivers beyond the narrow area of health. This paper presents a platform to support applications in the social sector, with the intention of guarantee the interoperability of them with the existing healthcare information systems. This platform is likely to generate new information objects to accommodate the needs of recording and sharing of information from a wide range of providers.
