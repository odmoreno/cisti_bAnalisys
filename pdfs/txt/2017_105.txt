Media consumption and media literacy in university students
ABSTRACT
This research includes information on the cultural and media consumption of young Ecuadorian university students and the relationship that exists with the media skills they have. The inquiries were carried out in two stages, the first analyzed the consumption of traditional and digital media of Ecuadorian university students in 2015. Twenty-six universities in Ecuador were studied with representative samples of each university, within a target group of Young people between the ages of 18 and 25, considered generationally as Millennials. 8,483 young people were part of the study group on media consumption and cultural consumption. The second research on media skills was developed two years later (2017), in this case three universities in the city of Loja (Ecuador) will be taken as case study. The results show that the young Ecuadorians experience the generational change, but it still has to critically alphabetize this group under study.
