A methodology for evaluation of energy critical infrastructures against cyber attacks
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, Critical Infrastructure plays a fundamental role in our modern society. Telecommunication services, water and electricity supply are examples of such infrastructures. They expose the society to security threats. To safeguard against these threats, providers of Critical Infrastructure services also need to maintain the security objectives of their interdependent data networks. The Supervisory and Control Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are an important part of the Electric Power System Critical Infrastructure. They require protection from a variety of threats and their networks are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper presents a methodology to identify the risks and the maturity of the organization in relation to the information security processes and the implementation of a business continuity plan focusing on the information security at Electric Power System Critical Infrastructure against threats that can affect their technological environment.
