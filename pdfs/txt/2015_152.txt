Introducing the process improvement in Higher Education Institutions
ABSTRACT
Project management has existed since the beginning of civilization. However, due to the lack of standardization for its performance, it still hanging up, among others, the next two problems: 1) poor control of the scope, time and cost of the project, where existing techniques like earned value, are not exploited and 2) lack of roles and responsibilities definition. In this context, Higher Education Institutions are not the exception because they have similar problems that hinder the implementation of efficient project management practices. As result, the reports and communication channels are not well defined, and the lessons learned are not documented. This paper presents a case study in order to implement a framework for defining and improving project management processes in higher education institutions based on an adaptation of the goal - question-metric methodology (GQM), the extraction of higher education institute tacit knowledge and taking the project management book of knowledge (PMBOK) as a reference model.
