Open access research trends in the education sector: A literature review
ABSTRACT
We conducted a literature review on Open Access - OA- to identify research trends on the subject. The review was carried out in the SCOPUS database and showed the following main themes: 1. Perception of the academic community on OA resources, 2. Repositories, 3. OA journals, 4. OA tools, and 5. Impact of publications in OA, and 6. Others. However, there are underlying concerns to the implementation of OA platforms, such as resources, not only technological, but financial and human, for the support of these platforms.
