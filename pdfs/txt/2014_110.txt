Evolving process improvement using multi-model enviroments and knowledge management
ABSTRACT
Even when software process improvement offers a key opportunity for software industry organizations to become more efficient, selecting the wrong reference model according to the way the organization works becomes a trigger to not have success in the improvement implementation. In this context, the effective integration of models and standards means a tool that improve the information sharing and communication that can play a crucial element for the implementation of multi-model environments to be used as reference model in software process improvements. However, the use of multi-model environment involves complex decision-making activities and requires supporting tools to coordinate and optimize the information management. This work presents an ontological framework that allows the knowledge management. Besides, this is capable of integrating decision levels to support the implementation of software process improvements in software development organizations using multimodel environment as reference.
