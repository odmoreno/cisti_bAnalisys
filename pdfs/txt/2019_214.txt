EMG Data Acquisition and Flight Control of Quadcopter on Different EMG Signals
ABSTRACT
ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) is a study of muscle activity by recording electrical signals produced during muscle flexing/relaxing. Basic techniques are surface EMG (non-invasive) and EMG acquired by inserting needle/wire electrodes into the muscle group (invasive). Non-invasive technique (SEMG) presents challenges such as correct placement, proper preparation of the surface (skin), impedance matching, electrical interference from external sources and accuracy of the amplifier. This paper focuses on SEMG signal obtained from biceps of a human arm which is used to initialize the quad copter and its landing by the use of a servo motor controlled by Arduino Uno. The paper also presents different signal processing techniques applied on the acquired SEMG signal, which is used to determine threshold for initialization of the quadcopter. The technique presented is a low cost solution to the Myo Gesture Control Armbands and expensive bio signal processing units available in the market.
