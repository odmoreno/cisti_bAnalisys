Diagnostic Model for Improving Workers Performance in the D&P Sector
ABSTRACT
Companies operating in the market of Design and Advertising (D&A), frequently use vector and raster drawing tools that require some specialization in their use. The performance in the use of this type of tools by people with psychosocial and psychomotor problems can be affected, and it is important to identify mechanisms to mitigate the impact of such constraints. The article presents a diagnostic model with a set of recommendations aiming to improve the comfort of the employee, with symptoms that may be temporary or chronic, at the workplace or workstation. The diagnostic algorithm takes into account demographic data and key words to infer the degree of severity of the psychosocial and psychomotor constraint of the person being analyzed. It can also contribute for companies to improve their understanding of how they can adapt their infrastructure at the workplace for greater comfort of the collaborator. Based on the selected operating procedure, the diagnostic algorithm will also provide specific recommendations on which assistive technology to use, including an estimate of the mitigation rate of the diagnosed constraint as well as information on possible fiscal/social benefits.
