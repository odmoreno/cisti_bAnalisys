Integrity and confidentiality of files in the BioNimbuZ federated cloud platform
ABSTRACT
A federated cloud environment consists of interconnected clouds that share resources using a transparent user interface. In these environments, it is not an easy task to ensure the integrity of files handled by the federated clouds due to the fact that they are no longer physically in possession of their owner. Another consequence is the difficulty in protecting against file access from malicious entities. This paper deals with the problem of security in federated clouds, in particular on the BioNimbuZ platform. We propose the use of a file integrity policy based on file hashes, as well as a policy of confidentiality using encryption algorithms. Experiments carried out showed the effectiveness of this approach in verifying the correctness of files and that no-one other than the BioNimbuZ users have access to the information.
