Quality models for online e-Government services
ABSTRACT
The study presented in this article will serve as a basis for the development of a suitable methodology whose purpose is to evaluate the quality of Local e-Government online services. Citizens expect quality public services, and their online dimension is no exception. The quality of these services should be analysed and accounted for, in order to maximize and develop strategies that improve the offered services, increasing the levels of satisfaction of their recipients. In this sense, this first study puts forth a systematization of the relevant bibliography, focusing on the quality of e-Government services. Each methodology was analysed in order to identify the main quality dimensions used. Up to the present moment, we were unable to identify a service quality evaluation method particularly focused on local online e-Governments, and this justifies the development of an investigation project whose main purpose is to create such a methodology in this field.
