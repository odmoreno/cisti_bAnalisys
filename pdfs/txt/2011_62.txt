E-work at a global scale and its impact on employment and management practices
ABSTRACT
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play a determinant role not only in the progress of economic, knowledge and labor globalization, but also in the social organization of peoples' lives. ICT may impact many different domains of peoples' living like the economic activities the spatial organization, transports, urbanization, building architecture, environmental preservation and, ultimately, the citizens' quality of life. Environmental protection is a matter of growing concern among the citizens, the European Union in particular not to talk about worldwide environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs). E-work has the ability to improve the environment as it will effectively reduce road traffic pollution, lower energy consumption and diminish the desertification of inner regions thus potentiating rural development. While explaining these subjects, our paper will focus equally on the impact of e-work at a global scale, highlighting the effects it has at both employment and corporate level.
