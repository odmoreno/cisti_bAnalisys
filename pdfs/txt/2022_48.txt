Open innovation model focused on the university
ABSTRACT
The objective of this research is to generate a model that allows open innovation (IO) from the university, a review of 67 articles from the Scopus database was carried out, in which characteristics related to the IO were identified, collaboration networks, knowledge generation and open innovation practices. Based on the above, it was possible to detect the fundamental parts for the design of the model in terms of its structure and description of each of them. The results indicate that the characteristics of innovation in the university make collaborations closer between government and companies, allowing good results in innovation through collaboration networks, development environment, in addition to the generation and transfer of knowledge and open innovation practices, to obtain services, products, intellectual property and patents. The proposed model allows universities to have a route to generate open innovation, being one of the fundamental pillars human capital, the model can be applied in any university. The model presented is based on the literature review, which provides reliability of the model.
