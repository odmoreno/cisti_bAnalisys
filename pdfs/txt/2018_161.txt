Temperature monitoring system for the pasteurization process applied to the small dairy industry
ABSTRACT
In the dairy industry, pasteurization is a very important process since it guarantees the flavor, yield and quality of the final product. Consequently, monitoring of temperature and time is very important during the pasteurization process. If this monitoring is done manually, this negatively affects the quality of the product and the safety of the operating personnel of the process. Based on the previous problem, the purpose of this project is to design a low cost and portable architecture for temperature monitoring in dairy product silos. As results obtained, a functional prototype was developed and evaluated in the Lactofino industry. The prototype captures the data by means of an RTD sensor, conditions them, visualizes them and finally identifies and alerts the operator about the stage of the process in which the dairy product is located. For the evaluation of the prototype, the comparison of the temperature measured by the prototype and by a reference instrument was made, the maximum absolute error obtained was 1Â° C.
