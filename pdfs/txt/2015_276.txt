Data mining and electronic devices applied to quality of life related to health data
ABSTRACT
The development of new technologies, information systems, decision support systems and clinical parameters prediction algorithms using machine learning and data mining opens a new perspective in many area of health. In this context, relevance presents the concept of Quality of Life (QOL) in health and the possibility of developing Support Systems Clinical Decision (SADC) that use it. Through individual expectation of physical well-being, psychological, mental, emotional and spiritual patients, discussed variables and measures the quality of research area of life, we intend to make a study of data to establish correlations with laboratory, pharmaceutical data, socio-economic, among others, obtaining knowledge in terms of behavioral patterns of chronic patients, achieving a number of reliable data and easily accessible, capable of enhancing the decision-making process by the specialized medical teams, seeking to improve treatments and consequently the related quality of life with the Health chronically ill. This paper studied and compared related studies that develop systems for decision support and prediction in the clinical area, with emphasis on studies in the area of quality of life.
