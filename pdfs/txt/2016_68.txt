Incorporating technology into education processes: Proposal for an extension of the “Technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge” framework by applying integrated cognitive competencies
ABSTRACT
The ongoing communicational transformation brought on by digital technology and the increasing imbrication of reticular ecosystems amplify their effects and changes in social life, defining new relationship configurations. The practices and trends of incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into education, published in the past five years, points to a trend of simply transposing everyday ICT into school processes, without taking into account the necessary pedagogical, technical and conceptual adjustments, nor other factors of the educational complexity. This paper presents an alternative application of an extension to TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge) framework model with CCI (integrated cognitive skills) application for incorporation of technology in the educational process as a way of overcoming these difficulties. The combined application of technological and pedagogical skills in this hybridized model allows the enhancement of learning processes by thinking of education and technology as integrated tools, becoming absolutely vital for better understanding, rethinking and reformulating syllabi, educational policies and practices so as to improve teaching processes.
