Analyzing Web-Based Flood Forecasting, Warning and Evacuation Applicationâ€™s Design and Development Processes in the State of Sabah
ABSTRACT
Using the systems engineering process (SEP) framework, the paper carefully delineates the design and development processes of the flood warning systems application for the State of Sabah in East Malaysia, which was improvised by integrating local and international flooding and landslide alerts. In this instance, the flood forecasting algorithms, advanced warning and evacuation details and approaches were combined for the web-based applications to function. In addition, the system was further fortified by having major disaster centres API providers such as USGS, PDC and MetMalaysia. The system aims to support flood policy planners, relief centre administrators, rescuers, and flood victims.
