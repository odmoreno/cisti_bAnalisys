Auditors, in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of audit procedures and, consequently, their performance, have had to adopt technological tools to support auditing. Thus, this study intends to identify which computerized tools are used by the Portuguese Statutory Auditors, and reveals the tasks in which those tools are used. In order to achieve these objectives, a questionnaire survey was carried out. The main conclusions show that there is a great variety of technological tools used, being the most used Microsoft Excel.
