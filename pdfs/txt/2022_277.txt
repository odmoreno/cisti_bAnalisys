Enterprise Architecture Management : Constant maintenance and updating of the Enterprise Architecture
ABSTRACT
The most important characteristic of an enterprise architecture is that it provides a holistic view of the enterprise [1]. For an enterprise architecture to play a central role in organizations, it must focus on processes, people, activities, workflows, relevant information, and must facilitate the translation of corporate strategy into daily operations. This is the only way to achieve EA objectives, which include improving efficiency, timeliness and reliability of business information. EA models support these goals by creating more transparency, measurability, and consistency [2]. For EA to do its job and add value to the organization, all information, data, processes, architectures and technologies need to be in sync with the business, which means they need to be constantly updated, which requires constant maintenance of the enterprise architecture. Thus, the solution proposed at the end of this document consists of a proposal for a constant maintenance of the EA that will contribute to the quality of the EA and, consequently, to the success of the organization.
