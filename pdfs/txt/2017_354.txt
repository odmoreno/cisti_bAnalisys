Big data and chronotopes as business models in the press
ABSTRACT
The idea of this research is to explore through the web pages how the concept of big data and chronotopos affect the digital press and journalistic company. The theoretical framework tackles both concepts through information theory, network theory and collects the opinions of some authors in different disciplines. The main perspective leads to a theoretical review of the definitions that can be considered in online journals. The methodology, in which this research is framed, is of an exploratory type. The techniques of observation and extraction of data from different web platforms, served as analysis for the informative correlation of big data as an irreversible tendency in the media scene. The research results indicate how big data and chronotopos point out the possibility of generating business strategies for the digital press.
