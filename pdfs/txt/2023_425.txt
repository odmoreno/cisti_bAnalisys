ABSTRACT
This work presents the result of a State-of-the-Art survey regarding the production of Phd. and Masters’ theses that address the use of virtual reality in the practice of education in Brazil. The survey was carried out using the CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)’ Catalog of Theses, from 2018 to 2022. The survey brought 12 works that adhered to the research purposes. These works come from different regions of Brazil and most of the productions come from Masters’ degrees. Despite the theme being relevant to the academic environment due to the potential for advancement in the tools applicable to students and the educational institution, it is little explored as research in dissertations and theses, which creates space for works that focus on the exploration of Reality technologies Virtual and similar and their uses in the educational context.
