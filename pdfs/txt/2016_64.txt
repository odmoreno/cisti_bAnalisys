Multimodal interaction robotic devices in a simulated environment
ABSTRACT
This work aimed developing a multimodal interaction platform of robotic devices in a simulated environment. It was developed and implemented a system that allow a user to interact with an Intelligent Wheelchair (IW) allowing to test the robot driving control through an adaptive multimodal interface. Furthermore, it was implemented and tested a robot representing a ramp for Paralympic sport “Boccia”. This Intelligent Robotic Ramp (IRR) will allow practitioners with various physical and psychological disorders, to practice this sport in a more autonomous way. This IRR will have greater emphasis on the BC3 category, where its practitioners have a very high level of dependency, having the need to resort to his coach and a launch pad (ramp) in order to play the game.
