Cultivation Chamber for Remote Management of Environmental Parameters of Horticultural Seedbeds
ABSTRACT
In order to offer a tool that helps reduce the risk of food insecurity, a culture chamber was developed. Using it farmers can generate a favorable controlled environment for the germination and growth of seedlings in the production of transplant seedlings. Temperature, humidity, luminosity, air quality and water level sensors were used, accompanied by actuators such as fans, water pump, heating and LED lighting, managed by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ board. The development of the local programming used the Python programming language on the Linux-based Raspberry Pi OS operating system, being able to store information by implementing the PostgreSQL relational database management system and transmitting data by connecting to the Internet wirelessly. At the same time, the cultivation chamber works under the supervision of a web application on the Thingsboard.io cloud computing platform for IoT projects, aimed at the remote management of the agroclimatic parameters necessary for the cultivated plant variety. This experimental research was supported by an study of the state of the art concerning the generation of controlled environments in agriculture, such as cultivation chambers and automated greenhouses, and validated through a process of observation and evaluation of the operation of the tool during the period of growth of transplant seedlings.
