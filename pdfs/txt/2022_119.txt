A Model to Provide Interoperability with Monetization in Operations in an Interagency Environment
ABSTRACT
In operations in an interagency environment with the participation of the civil and military institutions, there is a need for centralized coordination and, above all, for the sharing of information between the entities involved in order to achieve the common objective of the operation. The lack of standardization, the lack of a business model that allows the exchange of content and the high cost involved are barriers that hamper interoperability between agencies that participate in interagency operations. This work intends to tackle the aforementioned obstacles by proposing a business model, based on an architecture composed of an API Gateway and a monetization module, with the main objective of providing the necessary interoperability for the monetized sharing of information between the entities involved in interagency operations with the participation of the civil and military institutions. It is also intended to enable data sharing to be carried out transparently to those involved and to be a tool to encourage integration, attacking the obstacle of high cost, with the implementation of monetization whenever information sharing occurs. To achieve the objectives, the proposed model will have as a central element of its architecture a Gateway that will orchestrate the implemented APIs and, among others, the Contractual Control, Billing and Financial Control and Integration modules. To validate the proposed model, a prototype was implemented and tests were carried out to exchange information between organizations.
